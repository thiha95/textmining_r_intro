"1",1,"Belt and Road project tenders open  to non-Chinese: commerce minister",2018-09-21,"Business","The commerce minister said international companies will be invited to take part in Belt and Road-related projects and that the tender process will be transparent.                         As fractures between the international community, especially Western countries, and Myanmar widen, Myanmar should tap into the resources and connectivity offered by China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), analysts said. But Myanmar’s participation must be based on responsible investments and take into account the risks.          This month, U Soe Win, Minister for Planning and Finance, signed an Memorandum of Understanding regarding the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), a key component of the BRI. U Tun Tun Naing, permanent secretary for the Ministry of Planning and Finance, told The Myanmar Times that the government signed an “umbrella agreement”, while agreements on individual projects will have to be negotiated by the ministries from the two sides in the future.CMEC is a key component in BRI routes, covering a highway project from China’s Yunnan Province to Kyaukphyu via Mandalay, as well as for the Mandalay-Yangon-Mawlamyine route. Beijing is keen to speed up implementation of the proposed highways but Myanmar has difficulties to catch up with such expectations, given the country’s slowing economy and lacklustre investments from Europe and the US.Political analyst U Ye Htut, a former MP from Thibaw constituency, said that Nay Pyi Taw signed up to the deal quickly so as to secure Chinese investments as well as Beijing’s support for the peace process.“China’s role in Rakhine affairs, peace matters and investment is important for us. As we take part in the BRI development, we accept that both sides will be fairly benefited. We will share the [fruits of] Chinese development,” U Than Myint, commerce minister, said.As Myanmar risks being isolated by Western countries owing to the humanitarian crisis in northern Rakhine, the country cannot refuse to be part of the BRI framework. Joining the scheme is politically inevitable, analysts said.The CMEC deal signed covers bilateral collaboration in 15 sectors, including infrastructural development, investment, energy, agriculture, tourism and education. International investors and development agencies across the world will be invited to take part in the implementation process. While loans will be taken from China, call for tenders will invite international firms, according to U Than Myint. Therefore, investments will not only come from mainland China, but also Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and South Korea. It will be a level-playing field and the tender process will be transparent, he said.“As Myanmar cannot avoid to join the scheme, careful analysis must be done and plans which benefit the country should be implemented. We need to make an effort so our people can secure jobs and expertise and technological know-how could be improved,” U Zaw Win Pe, economic advisor of Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, said.Sri Lanka and Kyaukphyu“It is almost certain that it will be advantageous for the Chinese. We should not be paying for those expenditure from our pockets, we must also know how to negotiate with them,” U Ye Tun added.In June, Sean Turnell, economic adviser to State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, criticised the deep-sea port project. The precedent set by the $1 billion Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, where the government in Colombo borrowed heavily to construct the port, but couldn’t repay the loans and had to give China a 99-year lease for debt relief, is “the example that stands out, that has been really taken notice of in Myanmar,” according to the adviser. However, U Ye Tun said Kyaukphyu’s case is different and can reap benefits for both countries. The infrastructure, including the port, will make it easier for Myanmar to be a logistics hub as well as to revive its tourism industry. With more connectivity, it will make Myanmar more competitive in the import and export of good, according to U Zaw Pe Win. Meanwhile, better road conditions will allow more mobility of people. Domestic analysis said Myanmar should make use of BRI to attract manufacturers to the country, and beware that loans in China carry a higher interest rate than others. Some expressed anxiety over Myanmar losing part of its sovereignty if the country couldn’t repay its Chinese debts.","/news/belt-and-road-project-tenders-open-non-chinese-commerce-minister.html"
"2",2,"New city project by Chinese firm raises hackles in Kayin",2018-09-18,"National News","The Kayin State Border Guard Force and Jilin Yatai Group of China launched the Shwe Kokko new city project in Myawady township in the first week of August over the objections of local residents.                          The residents are worried that the project’s gambling houses and entertainment establishments could have a corrupting influence on young people, and that its airport, hotels and shopping centres could harm local businesses.          Jilin Yatai Group was registered with the Ministry of Planning and Finance under the name Myanmar Yatai International Trading Co Ltd in February 2017. In mid-April, ground clearing and fencing work began, said Saw Aung Myo, who lives in Shwe Kokko Myaing, Myawady.“We don’t know if it was approved by the government or the border guard. Since it is in the area controlled by the border guard, they were able to start just by informing the border guard, but they should have also informed local residents. Now, we can’t even go near it,” Saw Aung Myo said. The project, which covers over 2000 acres along the Thaungyin River and will cost an estimated US$15 billion (K23.35 trillion), applied for permission to build from the Myanmar Investment Commission in April 2017 and the state government, according to Colonel Saw Chit Thu of the border guard.Colonel Saw Chit Thu and Myanmar Yatai International Trading Company signed a partnership agreement in September 2017, organised by the China Federation of Overseas Chinese Entrepreneurs, before the plan received permission from the commission.The commission announced that it granted permission for part of the initial phase of the project on July 26 this year, specifically 25.5 acres with a $22.5 million investment.According to figures released by the commission, the border guard contributed 20 percent of total investment.However, the papers submitted to the commission did not include plans for gambling halls, an airport, and international universities, said U Aung Naing Oo, commission secretary.“Moreover, it stated that, as mutually beneficial investors, a Cambodian businessperson had invested 67.68pc and a Malaysian invested 12.31pc. There were no Chinese investors, even though Myanmar Yatai is Chinese-owned and China-based company,” said U Aung Naing Oo. “The company plans to add casinos, but its first application did not mention casinos. Because gambling is not yet legal in Myanmar, casinos are not possible at present,” said Saw Min Min Oo, a member of the border guard in the area.Gambling is illegal in Myanmar, but five casinos are operating in Myawady and the Thailand border area with the protection of the border guard.Under the first phase of the plan, hotels, housing, shopping centres, and golf courses will be built, which can be linked to Thailand through the Asian Highway Network. The first phase will be finished in three years by Chinese engineers. After that, the second phase will be implemented, said Saw Min Min Oo.“We wanted permission for the whole project in one go, but it didn’t go well when we sought comments from the state government, so permission was only requested for the first phase,” he said.The project will not bring many benefits for locals, said U Win Maung, who lives in Shwe Kokko Myaing.“All the workers and engineers are from China, and the profits will go to their organisations and business owners. Also, we could experience an increase in crime and environmental damage,” he said.The project site is on the border guard’s land, and as the government has given permission, it might not be easy to stop, he said.“Border guard members say the local people will get job opportunities from the project, but we will only be doing unskilled labour for Chinese people and foreigners,” he said.","/news/new-city-project-chinese-firm-raises-hackles-kayin.html"
"3",3,"Govt lures Chinese to fill Nay Pyi Taw’s hotel rooms",2018-09-14,"Business","As Myanmar’s hospitality sector is plagued by falling demand and oversupply, the ministry wants to lure one million tourists from China to fill the empty rooms in Nay Pyi Taw. But the cost barrier and lack of transport system make the barren capital all the more difficult to attract visitors, Western or Asian.                         The plenary session on tourism was held as part of the Myanmar Global Investment Forum on September 12, at the Myanmar Convention Centre II.          Nicole Haeusler, advisory board member of GIZ, said on the panel that Myanmar needs a marketing strategy to cater for different types of tourists who aren’t necessarily compatible. More Chinese tourists are visiting the country but Myanmar only has two beach destinations to offer all customers. It would be a problem when different types of tourists all gather in those two beaches. Furthermore, small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism sector need access to finance in order to tap into the market demand in both domestic and international tourism, she added.In major cities and attractions, there is an oversubscription of hotels but it is the variety of accommodation that is lacking. Tourist areas need options such as bed and breakfasts and camping.An editorial printed by The Myanmar Times on July 27 argued that it is better value for money to fly to other countries in the region than to travel domestically, and many foreigners working in Yangon have opted that instead.Dr Haeusler also touched on this issue, citing the costly flights and flight schedules as key hurdles. Foreigners working in other countries often travel to the countryside and beaches over weekends. “This is hardly happening in Myanmar,” she said.The consultant estimated that it costs at least US$1,000 for a family to spend a weekend in places like Shan as the tickets are too expensive. In addition, the last flights from Yangon to Heho and Bagan every Friday are around 4pm, while the last return flights are around 4pm on Sundays. Hence, those who want to visit places like Inle and Bagan would be “spending $1,000 but not having sufficient time there”.Visa exemptionBetween January and July, Chinese tourist number was up 30pc this year compared to the same period in 2017, according to U Zayar Myo Aung, director of the hotel ministry’s Tourism Promotion Department.“We admit that tourist number [growth] is slowing down, but we are now hoping to attract tourists from Asian countries,” he said, adding that more flights are coming from China. The sector was placing their bets on the visa exemption for Japan, Korea, and visa on arrival for mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Meanwhile, the government is keen to develop community-based tourism for areas near tourist hotspots including Bagan, Inle and Kalaw.Yet, an accompanying policy misstep backfired. The immigration ministry issued a policy on July 24 which requires East Asian visitors to bring US$1,000 in cash when they enter Myanmar under new arrangements. A week after the announcement, the government ditched that demand, following intense criticisms from industry players and even the hotel minister. The Myanmar Times asked U Zayar Myo Aung what lessons this policy U-turn offered to the ministry. “We discussed with the ministries concerned, like the labour, foreign affairs and home affairs ministries. We discussed and decided that this [measure] is not very convenient for the tourists. We are introducing the visa relaxation but one of the obstacles is this ‘show the money’,” the director responded.Asked if the authorities consulted private sector stakeholders before the immediate reversal, he said the ministry “discussed with the private sector” and had “many suggestions from the private sector, our stakeholders and other ministries” before changing the policy. Priority destinationAs small tour operators are on the verge of collapse, airlines are closing and market demand from hotels and flights has taken a hit among Western visitors, the government turns to an unlikely choice to boost its faltering tourism: the capital city.On the panel, U Zayar Myo Aung said the government was aware that some Chinese tourists tend to visit for 3-4 days and drop by the beaches only. “Nay Pyi Taw is the best way to explore,” he told the audience.The capital will be suitable choice for Chinese tour programmes, after Mandalay, Inle Lake and Bagan, U Myint Htwe, deputy director general of hotel ministry, explained.Nay Pyi Taw tourism will be based on the Asian market and business visitors, in particular the MICE (meeting, initiatives, conferences and exhibitions) approach, U Zayar Myo Aung said. “We already have facilities like the Myanmar Convention Centre and many big hotels here, and all of them are mostly empty,” he told The Myanmar Times. U Myint Htwe revealed that one of the China-based airlines is in talks with the ministry to bring one million Chinese tourists to the capital through charter flights, but conceding that the city needs more attractions for travellers. The tourism minister was said to be keen but the airline needed time to draw up a market plan.“We have a hot spring, elephant camps, Nant Mon Gyi waterfall and so on. But we need more international flights and proper bus transport within the city,” U Myint Htwe continued. This is not the first time - two years ago, the hotel ministry urged tour operators to bring more visitors there, but entirely in vain.Nay Pyi Taw has an oversupply of hotel rooms but only business visitors, not tourists, go there, U Thet Lwin Toh, chair of Union of Myanmar Travel Association, observed. Most business visitors usually fly back within the same day.While the city has sufficient accommodation and space to become a MICE destination, the costs and transport in the area present a hurdle, he noted. The ministry has established a website to promote the barren capital, but tourist attractions and transport system remains largely non-existent.","/news/govt-lures-chinese-fill-nay-pyi-taws-hotel-rooms.html"
"4",4,"MTSH reiterates plans to invest in Kyaukphyu, Thilawa",2018-09-13,"Business","Myanmar Thilawa SEZ Holdings (MTSH), which is listed on the Yangon Stock Exchange (YSX), has plans to invest in two of the three special economic zones (SEZ) in Myanmar. These include the deep sea port project in Kyaukphyu, Rakhine, and a multi-modal logistics hub in Thilawa, Yangon. It will also invest in the Myitkyina Economic Zone, said U Myo Mint Aung, Head of Finance at MTSH, without providing further details.                         This is in line with the company’s claims in March, when U Aung Soe Tha, MTSH managing director, said that the company would invest in more SEZs and focus on development projects in Yangon to achieve more growth.           The Myitkyina Economic Zone was established in May after the government signed an MOU with a Chinese company, Yunnan-Hteinchone-Htein Chon-Hein Rong Investment Co, to develop the area. “Currently, MTSH is studying these projects. If there are any further developments we’ll update our website and inform YSX,” said U Myo Mint Aung.MTSH’s objectives are to calibrate its strategy and business plan to better align with current trends in real estate. In accordance with Colliers International Myanmar, the company believes industrial real estate will show “strong resilience,” according to the company’s 2017-18 annual report. MTSH currently owns a 41 percent stake in Myanmar Japan Thilawa Development Limited, the operator and developer of a certain portion of Thilawa SEZ.MTSH also owns 80pc of Thilawa Property Development Limited, a real estate company which holds residential and commercial land. The company’s projects include the Thilawa Garden City as well as constructions works, small retail houses, shopping malls and workers accommodation. Shares of MTSH closed September 12 at K2,900 each. A total of 11,977 shares exchanged hands, nearly double the volume traded on September 11. The company has a market value of K112.9 billion kyat. The YSX will release rules under the recently enforces Myanmar Companies Law,  which could allow foreigners to trade on the local bourse and take stakes of up to 35pc in listed companies, before the end of the year, U Yin Zaw Myo, managing director of the YSX, said earlier this week.YSX","/news/mtsh-reiterates-plans-invest-kyaukphyu-thilawa.html"
"5",5,"Tour operators barely surviving due to “incredibly shaky” demand",2018-09-07,"Business","Small tour operators are on the verge of collapse as market demand in the tourism sector took a hit among Western visitors, as bookings for the impending peak season are “incredibly shaky”, according to a local company. In addition, hopes on wooing Asian investors were dashed by the now-abandoned “$1,000 in cash per tourist” entry demand, and it remains to be seen whether small players can be resuscitated by an increase in Asian travellers.                         The government has vowed to focus on attracting tourists from Southeast Asian countries in order to bring hope to the embattled sector. According to the statistics from the Ministry of Hotel and Tourism until the end of July, Thai tourists topped the ranking, followed by the Chinese. More than 150,000 Chinese tourists visited the country from January to July, which reflects a 34 percent increase in comparison to the same period in 2017.           In contrast, the number of Japan and S Korea travellers remained stable, and the tourism ministry is betting that those numbers will double after the visa free process is granted. For tourist arrivals in the country, there was a 2pc increase for travellers entering with visa, while there was a 5pc decrease for day-return visitor through the border gates. The total arrival number until the end of July was 1,970,013 people, in comparison to 2,019,752 international visitor in 2017 for the same period. This meant a decline of 2pc for the whole country.  The rate of travellers from eastern and western Europe, the Middle East, North America and other America countries are still falling. The decrease in travellers from Western and European countries spells trouble for SMEs tour companies which are dependent on them. As a result, some companies have returned their licences to ministry of hotel and tourism, U Naung Naung Han, secretary of Union of Myanmar Travel Association, told The Myanmar Times. “As far as I know, about 50 SME tour companies returned their licences to the ministry. I’m not aware of the exact reason about why they gave it back, but one thing for certain is that they are facing trouble,” he said. Forever Top, a travel and tour company, commented that they’ve already stopped operations at their sub-offices in other cities owing to fewer European travellers. “Even bookings for the upcoming peak season are incredibly shaky, where they’re being flip-flopped between confirmation and cancellation”, U Aung Soe, managing director from Forever Top, complained.  Furthermore, the company has already stopped the outbound market since the value of the dollar is increasing and the market is becoming puzzled due to many competitors, he said.  “We don’t know what to do in the current situation. Some tour companies have completely halted their entire business. The reason why we continue operating is to keep our brand image even we’re facing losses,” he added. According to the hotel and tourism ministry’s policy, they have a right to revoke the licence if the tour companies did not renew, within six months grace period, after their licence expire as well as some tour companies returned their licences, U Myo Win Nyut, director of the ministry of hotel and tourism, stated. “We received around 100 licences returned by tour companies as of today, and they also have stopped their business operations. We revoked some expired licences every month. However, new tour operators are still applying for the licence, about 15 companies weekly,” he said. According to the Investment Law enacted in August, all companies have to re-register at the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration, but some hospitality firms will not do so as the current market is difficult for business, U Naung Naung Han said. “There will be an increase in similar travel and tour companies where their licences are cancelled and their business terminated. Many more tour companies did not renew their licences, compared to last year,” he continued. The outbound market seemed to be an alternative market for the survival of SMEs operators while experiencing fewer Western tourists. Nonetheless, the expectation has been crushed due to rising foreign exchange rates. “When an ordinary package priced at K130,000 climbs to K150,000, it becomes difficult to sell to local travellers. So their substitute outbound market doesn’t work well to meet their expectations,” U Naung Naung Han observed. ‘Even bookings for the upcoming peak season are incredibly shaky.’ - U Aung Soe, Forever Top Policy backfiresSeventy percent of Myanmar’s tourism market demand comes from Southeast Asia countries, and this could be a ray of hope for the survival of SMEs tour operators.  Players were looking forward to the visa exemption for Japan, Korea, and VoA to China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Yet, a policy misstep backfired. The immigration ministry issued a policy on July 24 which requires Japanese, Chinese and South Korean visitors to bring US$1,000 in cash when they enter Myanmar under new visa arrangements. A week after the announcement, the government revealed they ditched that demand, following widespread criticisms from industry players and even the hotel minister. However, an official announcement letter is still yet to be released by the government.It was until September 3 that the website of Myanmar Embassy in Japan finally removed the cash demand. “That affected the customer trust because we already informed our agents in Japan that there was no need to show $1,000 in cash,” U Ye Tun Oo, CEO of Vivo Myanmar travel and tour company, explained.“We want to release an official announcement soon, stating that the US$1,000 for tourists has been dropped, and hope there will be more coordination between the hotel and labour ministries,” he went on. On the other hand, the Asia tourism market will act as a pillar for SMEs tour operators who had suffered losses in the Western and European markets. But, some of the potential Asia markets are not in the hands of local tour operators. “Frankly speaking, some Asia markets are not in the hands of Myanmar people. For instance, Korea market is rarely operated by locals. They will open a nominal company and arrange for all itineraries including Korean guides instead of hiring domestic ones,” U Naung Naung Han said. Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese companies are following the Korean approach in the Myanmar tourism market, he said, adding that an infamous “zero-dollar tour” scheme in the Chinese market is planning to start here and that some Chinese investors have already opened substantial souvenir shops in Hlaing Tharyar township.“This type of tour is worrisome for the ethnic tour operators. We don’t know the way how to protect our citizens. Our local tour companies are facing trouble and returning the licence to the ministry. Meanwhile, these types of tours are trying to set foot here,” U Naung Naung Han said. The sector will not experience massive changes until 2019 or 2020, and could continue spiralling down if there are no proper reforms.“We want to provide protection just like parents caring for their children with existing rules and regulations. If someone is wrong, action must be taken, and if that person is right, support must be given. Also, we want to support SMEs tour operators in the process of acquiring loans, which the hotel ministry should be deeply involved,” he suggested.","/news/tour-operators-barely-surviving-due-incredibly-shaky-demand.html"
"6",6,"Greater Bay next game for Myanmar",2018-08-17,"Opinion","The visit of the Myanmar delegation to Hong Kong in June, led by Myanmar Investment Commission chair U Thaung Tun, drew considerable attention from investors and professionals abroad. The minister’s official visit has illustrated the keen interest from Nay Pyi Taw to strengthen its connectivity with other countries in the region and enhance its image internationally.                         Myanmar is an important ASEAN country along the economic corridors of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Taking into account the rapid economic growth in the last few years as well as its geographical proximity and the long history of collaboration with China, Myanmar has plenty to gain from capitalising on Beijing’s national strategies. A lot of discussion has centred on the BRI, and rightly so. At the same time, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay) project offers considerable opportunities for Myanmar in many aspects.          Beyond the BRI, China’s central government earlier this year announced the ambitious development blueprint for Greater Bay with working details to be announced soon. The “Greater Bay Area” covers the cities of Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Zhongshan, Dongguan, Huizhou, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing. The GDP of the Greater Bay came to a total of US$1.58 trillion last year, which makes it the fifth-biggest economy in Asia, covering an area of 56,000 km2 and with an estimated population of 68 million. This scheme aims to achieve the free flow of people, logistics, capital and information, followed by collaboration in all areas with mutual benefits. The cooperation and communication mechanisms will be strengthened to reduce unnecessary competition within the area.The BRI and Greater Bay are complementary. Greater Bay will become the cornerstone in promoting BRI-related projects. The five areas proposed by the BRI - policy coordination, infrastructure connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people bond - will open up a gateway to international investors who are interested in the economic corridors to take advantage of the incentives and opportunities arising concurrently from Greater Bay. Since August 1, the new Myanmar Investment Law allows foreign investors to take up 35 percent in local companies. Myanmar enterprises could tap into the financial capabilities and technical expertise in infrastructure development as well as the robust legal and arbitration system in the Greater Bay, which is expected to be a platform offering a diversity of financing channels, including listing, syndicated loans, private equity funds and bond financing services. The area will also allow Myanmar businesses to fundraise and seek investments from Chinese companies and funds. For instance, Hong Kong, the world’s biggest offshore renminbi centre outside mainland China, is well-placed for new products and interested companies to arrange BRI project financing. The international financial centre will be an entry point for overseas companies to gain access to the vast Chinese market as well.The sharing of best practices, knowledge and technical know-how will benefit countries involved in the BRI, as the Greater Bay has a large pool of expertise in the fields of banking, accountancy, law, insurance, property valuation, infrastructure development, project management, asset management, IT and telecommunications. Those professionals and their services will be valuable for BRI-related projects. The adoption of the new Myanmar Investment Law and the Arbitration Law is a sign of Myanmar’s efforts to build a more reliable system for foreign capital and service providers to enter the country, contributing to economic growth and creating more jobs. Enterprises and professionals, especially those from Hong Kong, are also geared up to provide professional and vocational training and capacity building in developing economies. For example, MTR Academy and CLP Power Academy, established in 2016 and 2017 respectively, will give training courses for railway and power operation personnel in BRI countries.China has been actively promoting this international scheme and bringing countries on board to boost the economy and cultural exchanges, which are key factors in peace and stability. The establishment of the Greater Bay Area Myanmar General Chamber of Commerce is an important call to facilitate partnerships between Myanmar and the initiative, capitalising on the potential the Greater Bay offers. We expect the scheme to foster regional collaboration and establish closer partnerships in the years to come.Dr Raymond Ho Chung-tai is the convenor of the organising committee of Greater Bay Area Myanmar General Chamber of Commerce and chair of Hong Kong-based Dashun Foundation.

"7",7,"Govt, rather than conflicts, stands in the way of FDI in Kachin",2018-08-10,"Business, Opinion","Foreign investment in Kachin State currently happens in spite of, not because of, the government.                         IN an article “Kachin fighting scaring off investors: official” published by The Myanmar Times on June 21, U Tun Kyaw Kyaw, assistant director of the state’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA), said that Chinese investors who had expressed interest in construction, mining, livestock, agriculture, electricity and tourism have had second thoughts as the fighting intensified in the region. Given the instability of many areas in the state, he said it was difficult for investors to come.          Most instructive were these comments, because they showed a lack of understanding of what it takes to attract foreign direct investment to Kachin State. The current state of belligerence has much less to do with lack of foreign investor interest than he might think.On one hand, the Kachin State government tolerates a great deal of illicit Chinese investment, into banana farms, and smash and grab gold mines. The Chinese’s use of Myanmar citizens as straw buyers or proxies is pretty well understood, but little is done about it. Yet, legitimate foreign investors must endure the expensive and time-consuming processes required by DICA/ Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) for their own investments, pay taxes, and strive to be compliant with Myanmar law as understood. Where I work in Putao, a land boom is underway, thanks to Chinese carpetbaggers coming in and working to acquire property through a handful of local straw-men. This has distorted the market, as well as shattered what little faith people in the community may have in the rule of law. Inconsistent enforcement of the laws on the books does not inspire investor confidence. Difficult to accessShould a foreign investor decide to look around Kachin State, a literal barrier is encountered in that much of the state is off-limits to foreigners, and very short-term permits must be wheedled out of officials in several ministries and at multiple levels, from the Union government in Nay Pyi Taw down to the village tract level. Arranging these is a time-consuming pursuit, and in my own oft-repeated experience, DICA - of no help whatsoever - couldn’t care less whether or not any legitimate business came in the door or not. Yet in granting such permits, the seeker is made to feel as if he or she is making a mighty imposition on the people who grant them. DICA could and should hold itself responsible for smoothing out any and all interactions a potential investor may have with various ministries of the regional government.In making legal land acquisitions, the entire machinery of government slows down to a snail’s pace when it comes to issuing a new and clean Form 105. The fastest I have seen this happen in any township in Kachin State is six months. This is an area DICA could help a foreign investor navigate, but when we have suggested this, we get only blank looks from the relevant officers.In short, foreign investment in Kachin State currently happens in spite of, not because of, the government.U Tun Kyaw Kyaw also seems to have forgotten the massive investments made into Kachin State by the mobile telephone operators, and especially the tower companies. Hundreds, if not thousands of towers were built from 2014 up to the present, representing tens of millions of dollars in foreign direct investment. My company was tangentially involved in the effort for Putao. I can safely say that in making this herculean effort, absolutely no help was forthcoming from the Kachin State government and certainly not from DICA. Tower companies virtually did everything on their own. They did so against slow-burn resistance from every level of government when it came to seeking building permits, new Form 105’s for leases as well as access for foreign engineers. Almost no business requiring approach to government was easy and painless. More bananas?Reference is made in the article to the proposed “Myitkyina Economic Development Zone” in Nankyin village. We have known about this for quite some time. Any guesses about how the 4,500 acres for this thing were acquired? And that much land for a trifling $1.1 million investment is baffling, especially considering that the area has no infrastructure, roads or power supply.  Our guess is that “development” will be just more bananas. If this is considered wished-for investment, then the bar is set pretty low. Although promised during the MoU signing in early May, details of this scheme have not gone through any sort of public process.Although I’d hate to suggest that what is needed is a lavish junket undertaken with foreign aid funding, Kachin State's MIC and DICA need to send some working-level officials abroad, such as Cambodia or Vietnam. There, they should meet and walk and talk with counterpart officials of countries who actually know what to do in order to attract - and keep attracting - the foreign direct investment that developing economies need to thrive.  Perhaps in Vietnam they can tour the spanking new Samsung factory - the one which was originally going to be built in Myanmar.Robert Walsh is managing partner of Yangon-headquartered S&S Project Management, a project management and consulting company with projects in Kachin and other states and regions.","/news/govt-rather-conflicts-stands-way-fdi-kachin.html"
"8",8,"Will Belt and Road be good for Myanmar?",2018-08-03,"National News","Reading news reports coming out of Myanmar, I am always taken with the debate over the impact of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Of particular interest are the new China-Myanmar economic corridor and the debate over its winners and losers, as well as the nature of China’s intentions behind the ambitious infrastructure project.                         Some commentators point out the sovereign risk associated with allowing China to build and participate in key infrastructure development in Myanmar. I argue that the BRI should be viewed as a “win-win” rather than as a threat or a form of predatory economics by which the Chinese can export their infrastructure construction model, which heavily relies on state-owned enterprises.          The BRI incorporates a few key objectives that ensure that infrastructure projects are sustainable and deliver prosperity across the region through integrated development plans. This was clearly articulated at the 2017 Beijing BRI summit, which gave China a chance to outline its vision of a new global economic order. This was a big step forward for China in demonstrating that it was openly transparent regarding BRI and its intentions.Xi Jinping’s opening address went to great lengths to extol the Confucian principles of “win-win thinking” that are said to underpin the initiative. “China is willing to share its development experience with the rest of the world, but we will not intervene in other nations’ internal affairs, export our social system and development model, nor force others to accept them,” he said.Despite these claims, much scepticism has been directed at China’s intentions, driven by the views on what constitutes sustainable development.Fundamentally the great divide in thinking stems from the West’s approach to development, which measures success in commercial terms and seeks a financial return in three to five years. In contrast, China takes a longer view that incorporates a multi-level return on investment. China has a financial measure, but it also looks at social, environmental and cultural values to measure success over a 10- to 20-year period.These different approaches create different conclusions as to the true motivation behind the BRI.The Chinese are following a pattern of growth that has been led by investments in building local capability and capacity, which has led to excess capacity being created in their economy, such as in steel production and railway construction. Detractors argue that the BRI is merely a means to redeploy this excess capability by connecting new markets through the construction of key infrastructure.However, surely the sharing of China’s expertise and knowledge gained from its own experience benefits the recipient country, which no longer needs to invest time and money in a development learning period. Does this not lead to sustainable development, as it lifts communities out of poverty sooner?Not only is this a “win-win” result, it is compatible with benchmarking techniques used by Western companies to expedite organic growth. Accessibility promotes growth through the BRI economic corridors and routes, and funding allows this to happen.The current geo-political position suggests that Myanmar has a low sovereign credit rating, which arguably points to capacity to service the debt. This plays to the “win-lose” narrative that claims China is manipulating market and economic conditions to gain control over key assets to create a new world hegemony. This argument has been directed at the Myitsone Dam hydropower project, and as proof points to Pakistan and Sri Lanka having high debt. The weakness in this argument is the lack of understanding of a long-term investment approach. It also fails to take into account that debt-for-asset swaps are an effective way for a country to lift its citizens out of poverty by creating employment and building the economy. Myanmar needs to expand electricity to 70 percent of the population, which currently relies on substandard and environmentally harmful sources of energy. Electrification is needed to help build a middle class.Applying western standards to financing would likely mean these projects would not be financed, based on current economic and business models. This is a “win-lose” approach that would condemn Myanmar to prolonged poverty.The debate about energy and power has distorted the energy market in Myanmar, with funding being limited to “green energy” sources. Myanmar can join the global transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, but could benefit more from China – which has been a leader in green and alternative energy technology – by adopting a wider definition of “green financing.” Recognising the importance of electricity in achieving sustainable development, the BRI makes power generation a central part of its infrastructure plan.China has been pursuing an energy mix that balances traditional energy sources with renewable energy infrastructure. This is clearly articulated in China’s financial policy, which integrates environmental issues with financial and social decisions and promotes green finance by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, based in Beijing.Unlike the West, China includes funding for clean coal technology and high-efficiency transport fuel production. This “win-win” approach is critical to ensuring sustainable development in a country like Myanmar, with its large rural population.Taking a multi-level approach to investment return, I believe that the BRI offers a ‘win-win” and sustainable development opportunity for Myanmar.Andre Wheeler is CEO of Asia Pacific Connex, with more than 25 years of experience in international business.

"10",10,"Garment factories shutter on rising wages, land leases",2018-07-24,"Business","A total of 14 factories in Yangon’s industrial zones may cease operations within the next two months due to the rising cost of land and employees. Most of the factories are run by garment manufacturers.                         The shuttering of the factories could leave over 3000 jobless, said Daw Sandar Min, regional representative in Yangon and chair of the Finance, Planning and Economic Affair Committee under the Yangon regional Hluttaw.          “We will meet with the businesses from the Yangon industrial zones to learn why they want to shut down, as the consequences will have a large impact on the economy on the micro level,” Daw Sandar Min said. U Myint Soe, chair of Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association, reckons the main reason garment investors are throwing in the towel is rising production costs, particularly wages.Earlier this year, the National Committee for the Minimum Wage set the country’s daily minimum wage at K4800 (US$3.60) or K600 per hour for an eight-hour day despite objections from both labour and employers. This is up by more than 30percent from K3600 before.Myanmar’s low level of wages is among the top reasons foreign manufacturers choose to set up base in the country. Now that the minimum wage has risen though, “I see that many businessmen, including the locals, are thinking twice before investing in manufacturing-intensive sectors like garments,” U Myint Soe said. Rising land costs are also a problem. During her recent visits with six garment factories, Daw Khine Zar Aung, chair of the Industrial Workers Federation of Myanmar (IWFM), said some manufacturers have been forced to move out of the industrial zones as a result of rising land leases. “The garment industry is under pressure from having to raise the minimum wage. At the same time, productivity, which is already lower than other countries in the region, has not improved. As a result, many garment businesses no longer want to operate here,” said U Myint Soe.Seduno (Myanmar) Fashion Company, which is run by a Chinese investor, is a recent example. Earlier this month, the firm closed its factory citing low production, the inability to export in time, rising land and factory rentals and higher minimum wages as the main reasons for ceasing operations. Foreign investmentsAs a whole though, foreign direct investments in garment manufacturing are still looking robust. According to data provided by the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration and Ministry of Commerce, foreign direct investments into the manufacturing sector are the third highest in Myanmar. Manufacturing in Myanmar mainly consists of garments, which represents the country’s second largest export. In 2016-17, the industry exported garments worth some $2.2 billion. According to Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association, there are 400 garment factories including over 170 run by foreigners. Over 60 pc of these investors are Chinese. Myanmar-produced garments are mainly exported to Japan, EU, South Korea, US and back to China. And, with trade tensions rising between China and the US, financial experts and industry watchers in Myanmar are now expecting the Chinese to move more production activities into the country, resulting in more Chinese factories opening up in Myanmar.","/news/garment-factories-shutter-rising-wages-land-leases.html"
"11",11,"Myanmar to trim Kyaukphyu cost but drops Annan’s strategic review suggestion",2018-07-12,"Business","Nay Pyi Taw’s plan to reduce the cost of Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone, including the proposed deep-sea port, will help cap its external debt load and avoid repeating Sri Lanka’s Hambantota’s precedent, according to London-headquartered research firm BMI Research. At the same time, a government committee has dropped any mentioning of commissioning a Strategic Environmental Assessment in its June progress update.                         BMI Research said in its latest report that Myanmar’s move to downsize the scale of Kyaukphyu SEZ is “positive for debt and growth sustainability” and “in line with the government’s intention of diversifying its foreign policy and reducing its reliance on Chinese investment.”          “We believe that Myanmar’s move to rationalise the Chinese-backed Kyaukphyu SEZ mega-project is positive for debt and growth sustainability over the long-run, given that the development has questionable commercial viability.”The report comes after planning and finance minister U Soe Win said earlier this month that the government is planning to downsize costs related to the Kyaukphyu project amid rising concerns that Myanmar could be taking on too much debt to fund it. He said Nay Pyi Taw is heeding “lessons that we learned from our neighboring countries, that overinvestment is not good sometimes,” referring to the $1 billion Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, where Colombo borrowed heavily to construct the port, but couldn’t repay the loans and had to give China a 99-year lease for debt relief. The cabinet minister said Myanmar wants to “cut all the unnecessary expenses”, but did not provide any details on how the government wanted to trim the proposal.The proposed Kyaukphyu SEZ, located in Rakhine State, consists of an industrial park and a deep-sea port. In 2015, a CITIC-led consortium won the bid to develop both components. Discussions under the National League for Democracy-led government have focused on shifting the stake ratio to 70:30. U Thein Sein’s government originally agreed to give the CITIC consortium an 85 percent stake. Debt trapDespite U Soe Win’s remarks, Raphael Mok, Asia analyst at BMI Research, warned that Myanmar will likely find it difficult to seek other sources of external financing for Kyaukphyu other than Chinese sources. The domestic capital market is at its infant stage while the government remains reliant on the Central Bank for direct deficit financing. “Raising capital overseas will also likely be challenging given that foreign investors will likely find it difficult to determine Myanmar’s creditworthiness due to the lack of information.” Sean Turnell, economic adviser to the State Counsellor, had earlier called the US$7.5 billion estimated price tag for the Kyaukphyu deep-sea port “crazy” and “absurd”. He said Hambantota’s precedent “has been really taken notice of in Myanmar”, arguing that the government should not be asked to borrow $2-3 billion from the Export-Import Bank of China to finance the project. In response, U Aung Soe, director general from the commerce ministry’s Trade Promotion Department branded those concerns “baseless” because “a decision has not been made whether loans are required” for the port.U Thaung Tun, Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) chair, weighed in on the issue during his visit to Hong Kong two weeks ago, dismissing the fear of a ""debt trap"" and reiterating his confidence that Kyaukphyu would be a “win-win"" deal.Still, MIC has no jurisdiction on SEZs. According to U Tun Tun Naing, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Planning and Finance, negotiations of the Kyaukphyu project are being led by the finance minister and his ministry's Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA).SEZ Central Executive Committee chair U Than Myint, who’s also commerce minister, said last week that some agreements on the project have been reached and “the whole SEZ will not be implemented at once” but it will be developed “in parts”. Strategic Environmental AssessmentMeanwhile, a government committee tasked with implementing the recommendations of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State appears to have dropped the Strategic Environmental Assessment for the SEZ project as advised by the Commission. Instead, environmental and social impact assessments are being conducted.There has been confusion whether a Strategic Environmental Assessment is being or will be undertaken.The former Rakhine Advisory Commission, chaired by Kofi Annan, recommended that the government conducts an SEA and labour market assessment for Kyaukphyu SEZ. According to CITIC Myanmar, Kyaukphyu SEZ Management Committee (KSMC) has already issued a notification on January 16 to authorise an Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) and the site geological and topographical survey. This is confirmed by the progress report published in a state-owned paper by the Committee for Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine State on June 12, stating that “CITIC and the government designated entity as a counterpart from Myanmar working closely” on the ESIAs and survey. The Myanmar Times has requested to a copy of the January 16 notification but has not seen the document to date. In February, the implementation committee announced that the KSMC would conduct an SEA prior to ESIA. But the June update omitted the SEA part, only saying that a labour market assessment is in the pipeline with International Labour Organisation (ILO). A SEA prior to ESIA is “a tangible step the NLD can take to avoid another Myitsone scenario”, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) previously emphasised.MICSpecial Economic Zone","/news/myanmar-trim-kyaukphyu-cost-drops-annans-strategic-review-suggestion.html"
"12",12,"Cattle exporters request G2G trade with China",2018-07-10,"Business","To legalise the export of cattle such as cows and water buffalos to China, long delays in the processing of approvals between the two countries must be shortened, U Sein Aye Maung, chair of the Magwe Region Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said during a meeting with Vice President U Myint Swe at the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry.                         Even though Myanmar traders pay taxes to export cattle to China, the Chinese may not be legally purchasing the cattle. As such, local traders have requested a government-to-government (G2G) arrangement to legalise the whole process, U Sein Aye Maung told The Myanmar Times.          “Under a G2G arrangement, our market can strengthen and grow. Secondly, if there are any financial disputes, there will be legal recourse to minimise losses. These are the advantages for us,” he said. The request for G2G trade comes after the Ministry of Commerce in late 2017 legalised the export of live cattle with the objective of reducing illegal exports as well as improving the lives of farmers through the creation of job opportunities. Since the ban on exports was lifted, the total number of cattle exported from Magwe Region has reached 5,400. There are 118 companies across the 16 townships of Magwe which now export live cattle. Currently, 3,200 cattle have been collected from Magwe Region to holding compounds. After undergoing the required health certifications and vaccinations, the cattle will be ready for export, said U Sein Aye Maung.Traders must also apply for permission to export the cattle and later submit the relevant documents stating the number of animals sold to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation so that proper records can be kept. During the meeting with the U Myint Swe, the Magwe Region Chamber of Commerce and Industry requested noted that costs such as feeding and caring for the animals during the holding period are high as it takes 2-3 months for such procedures to be complete.“As we have to wait a long time to get the necessary recommendations from the departments, the maintenance cost increases for livestock animals like water buffalos, cows, sheep and goats. The longer they are held, the higher the cost becomes. As such, we are requesting that these steps are reduced or expedited,” said U Sein Aye Maung.The Magwe traders also suggested that the Livestock Breeding & Veterinary Department visit the livestock breeders at their farms to administer the veterinary treatments instead.They also requested loans with low interest rates as the breeding companies, especially smaller family businesses, need cash flow and funds for growth and investment.G2G","/news/cattle-exporters-request-g2g-trade-china.html"

Although well intended, this article ignores multiple facts that have made, in my opinion, Myanmar people weary of Chinese intentions. See, for example, the events surrounding a large port in Sri Lanka reported in the June 25 New York Times, “How China Got Sri Lanka to Cough Up a Port,” or a report in the June 5 Asia Times, “A Chinese colony takes shape in Cambodia,” or Asia Times’ May 13 article, “Little Laos risks losing it all to China,” which have given the Asian Development Bank reason to issue a stern warning on the effects of huge sovereign debt on ASEAN countries as a result of borrowing for Chinese projects. Other examples include Pakistan, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Djibouti, each of which has accumulated significant sovereign debt owed to Chinese projects, which, frankly, may be hard, if not impossible, to pay back.So, what’s the answer to Myanmar’s need for infrastructure investment? Although a complicated subject, Myanmar needs to stand on its own two feet in the international financial markets, first by acquiring a sovereign credit rating, then by issuing sovereign debt, while, at the same time, implementing tax and financial reforms that will guarantee its ability to pay back this sovereign debt. The government should start with the 2016 recommendations by the US Chamber of Commerce to the National League for Democracy-led government, which are based on extensive global experience in countries in transition. A prosperous and independent Myanmar, whose biggest resource is its people, can then deal as an equal, from an economic standpoint, with China or any other country, including the United States. Eric RoseEric Rose is a senior international business development attorney.Editor’s note: The Myanmar Times welcomes letters from readers who include a name and phone number or email address where they can be contacted to verify their identity.","/news/letters-editor.html-14"
"14",14,"China-Myanmar high-speed railway quietly back on track",2018-07-06,"Opinion","The China-Myanmar high-speed railway project (aka Kunming-Kyaukphyu Railway) that was derailed by the Thein Sein government is quietly back on track under the National League for Democracy-led government. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the project was signed in April 2011, but the scheme was reportedly halted in July 2014. My interviews with former officials of Myanmar Railways and journalists have revealed that social opposition, financial feasibility, distribution of gains and national security were among the challenges that stopped the train.                         “Time for Change” was the election motto of the NLD in the 2015 general elections. Although the direction of change may not be clear to everyone, the public generally expects that the new administration will uphold transparency and accountability in its governance. When the NLD took power in April 2016, it declared a review of MoUs signed between the previous government and international investors, most of them in the energy sector. Public resistance to projects like the Myitsone hydropower dam, Letpadaung copper mine, Dawei oil refinery, Thanlwin hydropower dams and China-Myanmar oil and gas pipelines resulted from a lack of public consultation and community consent, so the NLD’s measure to scrutinise foreign direct investment projects is commendable.          As time passes, however, it appears that the practice of the NLD government is not much different from that of previous administrations. In March, an MoU was signed for a feasibility study for the Mandalay-Tigyaing-Muse expressway and Kyaukphyu-Nay Pyi Taw highway projects. The route resembles the China-Myanmar railway. Last month, U Thaung Tun, minister of the Office of the Union Government, led a delegation to attend the Belt and Road summit in Hong Kong. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, he claimed that Myanmar would foster economic cooperation with China and that the railway connecting Ruili in Yunnan province with Mandalay “would start quite soon.” He also said the railway will extend to Yangon and Kyaukphyu, where the China-backed special economic zone and deep sea port project are located.Private talks between Nay Pyi Taw and Beijing over mega development projects contradict the National League for Democracy’s promise of change.It is evident that Nay Pyi Taw and Beijing have been talking to materialise the China-Myanmar economic corridor. How much do voters know about the projects? Have the obstacles to the high-speed railway been addressed? There is every reason to support the railway project to create jobs and boost economic development in Myanmar. However, to ensure public participation in economic development, the NLD government should have informed consultations with the public, especially communities that will be affected by the project.Even more disappointing, the China-Myanmar railway and highway are not exceptional examples of the current government’s lack of transparency. In the New Yangon City project that involves an area of land twice that of Singapore, the government consistently bypassed the public before signing an agreement with the Chinese investor on the development plan of the project. Since March 2017, members of the Yangon regional parliament, including Daw Sandar Min and U Kyaw Zeya, have asked the regional government for detailed proposals of the new city project for discussion, but to no avail.The government’s recent economic negotiations at high-level meetings with its Chinese counterparts indicate that it honours its pledge to support the Belt and Road Initiative, but how about its promise of change to voters?Debby Chan Sze Wan is a PhD graduate in politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong.

Newly appointed chair of the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) U Thaung Tun, who is also a cabinet minister, led a delegation including U Aung Naing Oo from the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA) and Daw Nilar Kyaw from the Yangon government as well as business leaders to take part in the third Belt and Road Summit organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) last week.          Myanmar recognises Hong Kong’s distinctive role as the superconnector in the BRI. - U Thaung Tun, cabinet minister and Myanmar Investment Commission chair“Myanmar has always attached and continues to attach great importance to Hong Kong. We are aware that Hong Kong is one of the best places in the world to do business.“Myanmar recognises Hong Kong’s distinctive role as the superconnector in the BRI,” he remarked at the welcoming reception. Trade between the two regions reached US$386 million last year, while the city accounted for more than 10pc of the total approved FDI flow in the country. Numerous multinationals associated with Hong Kong, including Hutchison Ports, Jardine Matheson, Kerry Logistics, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts and Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, are active in Myanmar.“Our relations go way back to the colonial times. We want to provide a mutually beneficial relationship.“With Myanmar opening up, there is an opportunity for Hong Kong investors to jump on the bandwagon and join the great numbers of investments coming to Myanmar. Hong Kong is an extremely well-connected city, and Myanmar is only three hours away by flight,” the MIC chair continued. Citing the new Investment Law and Companies Law, he stressed that “the time is ripe to invest in Myanmar” and pledged that the country “will be transparent, efficient, and friendly to our investors” to “seek to promote responsible investment.”U Thaung Tun, along with the UK’s trade minister Baroness Fairhead and other officials, spoke at the Summit’s luncheon plenary. He said that closing Myanmar’s infrastructure gap can “contribute to the ongoing peace process” and wooed the audience to invest in transport and energy infrastructure, vowing to provide “a level-playing field” for foreign investors.At a sideline interview, Melvyn Pun from Yoma Strategic Holdings urged the Myanmar government to step up efforts in the BRI. “I believe the government needs to take a much more proactive role in identifying the key opportunities for Myanmar.” The BRI is about investments and connectivity in Asia, particularly China, and hence Myanmar can take advantage of that by “plugging some of the infrastructure gaps that we have”. Instead of waiting for road or railway proposals, Myanmar should identify her own priorities and key areas which the country wants to attract capital. Regarding the country being too passive, “I think this is a point about the BRI but also a point, more broadly, that Myanmar is sometimes too reactive in waiting for investors to come.”          bri-2.jpg                “If you look at the Hong Kong’s approach, such as the HKTDC who arranged the Summit and also, for example, Singapore and even Chinese regional governments, they are very proactive in reaching out and looking for those investors and partners who they want to bring into the country. I think Nay Pyi Taw can take that approach,” Mr Pun commented. Beyond infrastructure, Myanmar can collaborate with Hong Kong and China in IT-related investments such as e-commerce and mobile money.I believe the government needs to take a much more proactive role in identifying the key opportunities for Myanmar. - Melvyn Pun, Yoma StrategicJohn Barnes, director of Marga Group, said there are a few criteria which Myanmar should focus on in order to attract BRI investments.Firstly, commercial terms and contract arrangements must be matching with other international investment destinations, he pointed out. “The world has seen multiple economies open and globalise. While each market has its own pace of development and unique traits, business models largely follow the same trajectory. Investors will balance the risks and rewards across markets, hence both investment risks and incentives should be clear and competitive from the get-go.”Secondly, access to financing for Myanmar, which is limited compared with the rest of ASEAN, needs to be addressed. For the private side, local consumers need to access credit at more reasonable rates for purchases of homes and other investments. “We constantly see emerging market taking off with the introduction of comprehensive mortgage laws and other credit tools. Foreign currency loans such as US dollar-denominated loans can be introduced too.”Mr Barnes said that direct active engagement with investors is always the first step in promoting inward investments, using the example of U Thaung Tun’s visit to the city. Another step is to organise tours and bring potential government partners and investors to Myanmar, as well as community engagement early on. “The local community should be briefed about the advantages of having foreign direct investment, including the economic and social benefits. History has taught us that foreign capital will always enlarge the pie and create more wealth for everyone, but some people feel that FDI create unnecessary competition and social problems. These negative feelings can be eliminated with proper planning,” the director explained.History has taught us that foreign capital will always enlarge the pie and create more wealth for everyone, but some people feel that FDI create unnecessary competition and social problems. - John Barnes, Marga GroupMeanwhile, Vincent Lo, chair of the HKTDC, warned that the looming trade war between America and China means the BRI is more important than ever, as countries can avoid trade frictions by producing and selling locally.Peter Beynon, chair of British Chamber of Commerce Myanmar, who was also present for the Summit, observed that the specific published projects of the BRI in Myanmar will link Yunnan Province  - and the whole of western China - to the Indian Ocean both logistically and as a trade route. “The infrastructure that will be required to achieve this objective will surely bring employment and prosperity to Myanmar. I am optimistic that properly embraced, the BRI will be positive for the country and the people of Myanmar,” Mr Beynon commented. However, this does not mean that Myanmar merely “opens its doors and welcomes everything”. “Myanmar must scrutinise each project on its merits and ensure that there is true value and real benefits to the people of the country and the economy,” the business leader went on.Similarly, a Japanese logistics pioneer headquartered in Thilawa Special Economic Zone who joined the delegation is keen to capitalise on the cross-border trade between China and Myanmar: Tomoaki Yabe, managing director of Daizen, said that private businesses are supportive of efforts to improve the infrastructure and boost trade, given that projects adhere to international standards and are fair and transparent for all players. His logistics firm, which is Myanmar’s first bonded warehouse and freezone warehouse operator, is set to open an office in Myawaddy within the next few months. The Yunnan-Shan cross-border logistics will be the next move. “Our next target is possibly branching out to Muse, where Yunnan-Shan border trade is expected to be a major area of growth,” Mr Yabe noted.","/news/myanmar-throws-weight-behind-hong-kong-belt-and-road-superconnector.html"
"16",16,"Chinese investors mull expansion plans in Myanmar",2018-07-04,"Business","Chinese investors have been showing keener interest to do business with Myanmar.                         At the China (Dezhou) Myanmar Economic Trade and Investment Cooperation Seminar on Monday, during which Chinese firms sought business partners in Myanmar for the purposes of trade and investment, Li Lian Jun, chairman of China Chamber of International Commerce (CCOIC), said firms are interested in the energy, agriculture and manufacturing sectors.           Chinese firms are showing more interest in Myanmar at a time when the ongoing trade war between China and the US, which has seen the latter slap 25 percent tariffs on up to $50 billion of Chinese goods, is intensifying. As a result of the trade tensions, some Chinese manufacturing businesses have enquired about moving their production facilities to Myanmar’s Thilawa Special Economic Zone, U Than Aung Kyaw, deputy director general of Directorate of Investment & Company Administration, told The Myanmar Times last month.As this represents a good opportunity for Myanmar to benefit from more foreign direct investments (FDI), the country must be ready to receive the influx of funds, U Than Aung Kyaw said.In fact, the government and China’s Yunan province are already finalising an agreement for Myanmar to export its cattle to meet rising demand in the Chinese market. Dr Yan Naing Soe, retired director of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, told The Myanmar Times that as China is now in a trade war with the US, Myanmar could benefit from higher cattle imports from China, which now imports 6,000 tonnes of beef from the US. Daw Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee, Lead Researcher of Institute for Strategy and Policy Myanmar, warned though, that it may “be too early to celebrate.” She said Myanmar should first have a proper strategy which includes plans to provide infrastructure and incentives to retain investors, as this will allow the country to take full advantage of the potential spike in FDI from China. “Accepting the spike in FDI without a proper plan or strategy may result in a spike in growth for the country in the short term, but not be sustainable in the long term if investors end up pulling out,” Daw Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee said.She added that, trade war aside, Myanmar also stands to gain from higher Chinese investments as firms look for ways to expand their operations overseas as a result of tighter environmental regulations in China. “These businesses have difficulties growing their businesses because the Chinese government has tightened its environmental conservation and waste management regulations and requirements. As a result, they may transfer their facilities and operations here,” said U Kyaw Htin, deputy chair at the Myanmar Livestock Federation.","/news/chinese-investors-mull-expansion-plans-myanmar.html"
"17",17,"Myanmar shouldn’t write off China without understanding her neighbour",2018-06-28,"Business, Opinion","An old Chinese proverb goes like this: “Three men make a tiger.” It means that if an unfounded premise is repeated many times, the premise will be accepted as the truth. Once this “tiger” is invented, it would be extremely difficult to dispel it from people’s minds, especially when we are living in a post-truth age when verifiable news is scarce and wishful thinking rampant.                         The recent debate on the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone illustrates “Facts matter not at all. Perception is everything.” The Myanmar Times on June 13 recently published an article on the Kyaukphyu SEZ and compared contrasting claims about the SEZ debt issue, quoting two prominent figures in Myanmar’s economic policy circle - Sean Turnell, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s economic adviser, and U Soe Win, co-chair of Kyaukphyu SEZ Management Committee.          The “debt trap” concept was first floated by Bloomberg as a “debt bomb” and was subsequently resonated in Dr Turnell’s interview in Singapore, as well as in a Financial Times report. According to Dr Turnell, to raise sufficient capital for the Kyaukpyu port, the Myanmar government “will have to borrow from the Export-Import [EXIM] Bank of China about US$2 billion to $3 billion.” Following this line, the Global Times, China’s state media, tried to dismiss this claim by saying that the SEZ deal has not yet been finalised and that the Myanmar government does not need to borrow money and can use land as capital. Meanwhile, EXIM Bank of China has not yet confirmed any loan for the Kyaukphyu project.Unfortunately for China, the “debt trap tiger”, though seemingly baseless in this case, has become widespread in Myanmar’s policy circle. This could have a potential impact on the Myanmar government’s decision-making process on whether to further postpone the Kyaukphyu project.Misperceptions in an asymmetrical relationship Simply put, the recent concerns over heavy debt from the Kyaukphyu SEZ is only a reflection of Myanmar’s deep fear for China’s dominance in Myanmar’s economy. Admittedly, it is unfair to accuse CITIC (the leading Kyaukphyu project developer) of the wrongdoings it has not committed. But this reflects one of Myanmar’s many structural (mis)perceptions of China. International relations academic Robert Jervis once said: “decision-makers tend to fit incoming information into their existing theories and images.”Despite the clarification by the Global Times, perceptions of a possible “debt trap” may have already impeded the negotiation process. The asymmetrical bilateral relations between China and Myanmar have put the two in a dilemma of unbalanced interdependence.Understandably, Myanmar does not want to miss the big inflow of Chinese investment under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an economic cooperation scheme initiated by President Xi Jinping in 2013. Nevertheless, it also does not want to be viewed as shifting towards China again - a lesson learned from decades of overdependence under military rule. The existing views on China’s investment – based on previous impressions – are relatively sticky and can only be changed bit by bit.It is usually argued that Chinese investment is viewed negatively by the Myanmar public. Yet, there lacks systematic empirical data on public attitudes towards different types of Chinese investment to support the argument. To obtain a more granular understanding, my colleague Youyi Zhang and I conducted a survey experiment on Myanmar people’s perceptions of Chinese investment.Experimenting on perceptions in Myanmar Though Myanmar has started to diversify its sources of foreign investment since the warming of its relations with the West in 2011, China remains the largest source of Myanmar’s foreign direct investment (FDI) in stock, amounting to more than 20pc of total FDI, according to the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA). China’s investment mostly concentrates on natural resources sector. The top four sectors that attract most Chinese investment are power, oil & gas, manufacturing, and mining, each comprising 67.4pc, 13.9pc, 6.4pc, 4.6pc respectively, according to DICA data as of April 30, 2018.This survey experiment is to understand what determinants can shape Myanmar people’s perceptions of Chinese investment projects in natural resources. We find public perceptions of Chinese projects are contingent on the firm’s local partner and social engagement strategy. In other words, respondents are likely to change their perceptions if they see the firm choose its Myanmar local partner and engage with the communities differently.Overall, there is an implicit bias against Chinese investments, which is likely based on experience of previous Chinese investments in Myanmar. But the findings suggest Chinese companies can improve their image by engaging more actively with local communities and selecting local partners more carefully. In the experiment, respondents are more favourable to investment projects from Japanese firms than Chinese firms when both partner with military-affiliated companies and engage with local communities indirectly. However, respondents show similar support rates for projects conducted by firms from China and Japan when they partner with local private companies and engage with local communities directly. These findings resonate with the local civil society’s call for transparency and responsible investment in doing business in Myanmar.The results suggest that public perceptions of FDI inflows are partly correlated with the perceived image of the investors’ country of origin (e.g. Japan vs China). Therefore, Chinese investors should be wary of existing negative attitudes but they can improve their image by carefully selecting their local partners and engaging directly and actively with the affected communities. Furthermore, this research offers a warning for project proponents involved in the BRI and the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor about the potential local resistance they may face if their investment strategies do not take the local context seriously.Ying Yao co-authored with Youyi Zhang the report “Perceptions of Chinese investment in Myanmar”, which is supported by the International Growth Centre (IGC).

"18",18,"Gas power plant in Mandalay to be ready by next February",2018-06-22,"Business","The National Infrastructure Holding-led consortium (NIHC), comprising of three firms, will construct a 145MW gas power plant in Kyaukse township, Mandalay Region, according to consortium.                         The tender was launched by the Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MOEE) in March 2018 and NIHC consortium was awarded the tender last month, Director Daw Yi Yi Htwe from MCM Co, a member of that consortium, told The Myanmar Times. Within the consortium, NIHC, a Yangon-headquartered infrastructure conglomerate, owns the largest number of the shares, followed Myanmar Chemical & Machinery and then a Chinese firm, one MCM official said.          The 145MW gas power plant will involve US$100-120 million investment over a span of five years, the official added.Negotiations are still underway for the Power Purchase Agreement with the MOEE and a proposal will then be submitted to the Myanmar Investment Commission, he said. MOEE will supply 30 million cubic feet of gas per day to the plant which consists of eight 18MW “Wartsila machines” made in Finland for electricity generation, Daw Yi Yi Htwe said. Wärtsilä is a Finnish firm which manufactures and provides power sources and other equipment in the energy sector.According to tender agreement with MOEE, the project proponent has 10 months maximum for construction on the land allocated by the ministry. Construction started in May and is scheduled to complete by February 2019.Once the construction is completed, the plant will start operation in February in order to supply electricity during the summer, Daw Yi Yi Htwe continued. The power generated will be added to the national grid.In early May, the MOEE has selected the winners of a tender for rental power projects in Mandalay Region. U Han Zaw, chief engineer at the Electric Power Generation Enterprise, told local media that Hong Kong-based VPower has been selected to operate a plant at Myingyan, while NIHC will run a plant at Kyaukse. Both will be fuelled by natural gas from the Shwe field and are expected to be ready by next summer.","/news/gas-power-plant-mandalay-be-ready-next-february.html"
"19",19,"Engage to overcome Myanmar bias against Chinese investments",2018-06-21,"Business","There is an “implicit bias against Chinese investments” in Myanmar, a report from the International Growth Centre argued, attributing the prejudice to the legacy of earlier Chinese projects in the country, including Myitsone Dam and Letpadaung Copper Mine. The way for Chinese firms to repair the tainted brand is to directly engage the affected communities and reach out to the domestic media.                         The IGC published the report “Public perception of Chinese investment in Myanmar and its political consequences”, co-authored by Ying Yao from Tsinghua University and Youyi Zhang from Cornell University, on June 20, which examines the general public’s perception of Chinese investment in Myanmar.           The briefs highlighted that China remains a powerful actor in Myanmar’s economy amid the country’s reforms and opening up.Despite the diversification of investment sources, Myanmar remains one of the largest destinations for Chinese infrastructure investment over the past decade, particularly in the hydropower sector. 30pc of Chinese-funded dams built since 2000 are in Myanmar, while another 10pc are located in the rest of ASEAN. China was the single dominant investor in Myanmar before 2011, partly owing to western sanctions, and accounted for more than 60pc of Myanmar’s approved FDI in 2012, most of which went to the infrastructure sector, including power, transport and energy. Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, combined with recent shifts in Myanmar’s political standing on the international stage, the report observed, means that Chinese firms will continue to play a major role in Myanmar’s economy. For example, the government in February signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China on the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, which Nay Pyi Taw approved last month.""Following the recent Rakhine crisis in western Myanmar, it seems that Myanmar is once again leaning towards China as Western governments ... increasingly place heavy criticism on the Myanmar government for its human rights record."" - Ying Yao and Youyi Zhang, International Growth CentreImplicit biasThe report revealed that public perceptions of Chinese projects are contingent on the firm’s local partner and social engagement but there is an implicit bias against Chinese investments, which is “likely based” on experience of previous Chinese investments in Myanmar, including to the Myitsone Dam and Letpadaung Copper Mine projects before the latter was investigated by a commission chaired by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. “Those projects caused widespread criticism and concerns in Myanmar,” Mr Zhang commented. In addition, Japanese firms were found to be regarded much more positively than their Chinese counterparts, even when companies from either country collaborate with military-affiliated companies and do not directly engage with local communities. Based on the survey, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan all enjoy a higher percentage of being seen as responsible investors than China.The survey experiment differentiated FDI project from private companies and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), but the difference is not significant. When both types of companies choose military-affiliated partners and engage with affected communities indirectly - only through local government - there is not a big difference in support rate among the respondents. In contrast, when both types of firms choose non-military local partners and engage with communities directly, the respondents favour private companies over the SOEs. Similarly, the results suggested that public support for BRI is contingent on the domestic partner and social engagement of the Chinese investor. For instance, Chinese SOEs which work with private partners and engage with communities directly would lead to improved public support for infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative. The report argued that this finding has broader implications for economic cooperation schemes under the BRI.Community and media engagementWorking with local communities directly is the key to repairing the tarnished reputation. Chinese investors can improve their image by “carefully selecting their local partners and engaging directly and actively with the affected communities”.“Furthermore, this research offers a warning for the Belt and Road Initiative and the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor about the potential local resistance they may face if their investment strategies do not consider the local context carefully,” the publication cautioned.Apart from communities, Chinese investors should also work with domestic media, especially the private media.“We suggest that they [Chinese firms] should engage more openly with the privately-owned media by providing accurate and reliable information before the unfounded rumours spread around. In the meantime, we also suggest private media conduct comprehensive and verifiable investigation about Chinese investment projects,” Mr Zhang explained.When it comes to investing in natural resources-related projects, foreign investors, including Chinese businesses, are well-advised to be more cautious and undertake due diligence. “This is especially the case for Myanmar’s designated ethnic states such as Kachin State and Rakhine State, which are abundant in  natural resources but are affected by long-running conflicts with the central state,” the report concluded.The report’s conclusion resonates with what academics and domestic business leaders said earlier. Simon Tay, chair of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said last year that the success of the BRI depends on whether Beijing can learn from the mistakes of Myitsone Dam and take into account concerns from communities. He said the issue is that China wanted a dam built in Myanmar with most of the power generated going to China. But most of the environmental and social problems would have remained in Myanmar. “But we need to minimise the problems [for affected communities],” the academic stressed.In the same month last year, U Khin Maung Win, CEO of Myanmar Shwe Pyi Tractors, also highlighted that early public engagement is critical for BRI projects because past experience suggests that  commercial gains from such cooperation, albeit smaller scale, were “rarely transparent”.","/news/engage-overcome-myanmar-bias-against-chinese-investments.html"
"20",20,"Chinese manufacturers eye Myanmar base as trade war escalates",2018-06-21,"Business","Myanmar stands to gain from the ongoing trade spat between China and the US, U Than Aung Kyaw, deputy director general of the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA),  said yesterday.                         Interest to set up manufacturing and production facilities in Myanmar among the Chinese has risen ever since the US this month imposed a 25 percent tariff on up to $50 billion of Chinese products, he told The Myanmar Times during the sidelines of Myanmar-Korea Investment Promotion Seminar in Yangon.          “Chinese businesses have been making enquiries at DICA about investing and setting up base in Myanmar,” he said. Myanmar may well see a spike in manufacturing companies from China setting up operations as the latter’s trade war with the US escalates. After the first round of tariffs was imposed by the US, a retaliatory move by Beijing saw some $34 billion of US goods to China placed under a 25pc tariff. On Monday, the US then threatened to levy an additional 10pc tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese products. If imposed, the move would place around half of China’s $505 billion worth of exports to the US under tariffs. Now, it appears that a rising number of Chinese manufacturers want to produce out of Myanmar, enabling them to bypass US tariffs. “The Chinese want to move their manufacturing facilities to Myanmar. Mainly, businesses from China want to set up base in Thilawa Special Economic Zone, which has been equipped with necessary power and transport infrastructure for ease of doing business,” said U Than Aung Kyaw.“We should be prepared to respond quickly to these enquiries as this is a good opportunity for Myanmar to draw foreign direct investments,” he added. U Shwe Hein, secretary of the Thilawa SEZ Management Committee, said the SEZ hopes to draw more Chinese companies which can transfer technological know-how to local businesses. “This will be a good opportunity for Myanmar to further develop its economy,” he said.Out of the 94 companies in Thilawa SEZ, just one, garment manufacturer Lu Thai Co, is from China. Nevertheless, China remains one of the largest investors in Myanmar, having invested a total of $20 billion in the country over the past 30 years, according to DICA.","/news/chinese-manufacturers-eye-myanmar-base-trade-war-escalates.html"
"21",21,"Kachin fighting scaring off investors: official",2018-06-21,"National News","Clashes in Kachin State have scared off investors, even those who have expressed interest in the natural resources-rich state, said a senior state investment official.                          U Tun Kyaw Kyaw, assistant director of the state’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration, told The Myanmar Times that businessmen from China and Hong Kong who had expressed interest in investing in construction, mining, livestock breeding, agriculture, electricity and tourism have had second thoughts as the fighting has intensified.          “There are many sectors where investments can be made. For example, Puta-o township has icy mountains which are good for tourism,” he said.Given the instability of many areas in the state, he said it is difficult for investors to come. Fighting between the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the Tatmadaw erupted in many locations of the state after a 17-year ceasefire broke down in 2011, but it worsened in April this year.Due to the widespread armed conflict, as many as 100,000 residents have had to flee their homes.“At present, we are inviting investors. But due to the situation, they haven’t come yet. There are some firms interested in doing business in the state,” U Tun Kyaw Kyaw said.Efforts by the government since  2016 to reach an agreement with the KIA – a powerful armed ethnic group – have yet to bear fruit. ‘Given the instability in many areas of the state ... it is difficult for investors to come.’ U Tun Kyaw Kyaw, Kachin State DICAU Tun Kyaw Kyaw said only one company has so far shown the heart to invest in the state amid the fighting. “Currently, there are no more companies that expressed interest (in investing). We had already signed a memorandum of understanding for developing the Mingalardon Industrial Zone. We are drawing up a framework, and I hope we can implement it at the end of 2018,” he said. The Kachin government signed an MoU on May 18 with Yunnan-Hteinchone-Htein Chon-Hein Rong Investment Co Ltd to build the Myitkyina Economic Development Zone. The company promised to spend K1.6 billion (US$1.16 million) on the project. The project will be developed on more than 4500 acres of land in Nankyin village near the state capital of Myitkyina. It will include supermarkets, schools, highway and railway for transportation, hospitals and residences.A Russian company has also expressed interest in oil extraction in the state but shelved the plan as the fighting worsened, he said.Despite the lack of peace in many areas of the state, some Chinese companies have invested in banana farming, U Tun Kyaw Kyaw said. Since 2010, Chinese citizens have been planting bananas by tissue culture across the state with the help of locally owned proxy firms, he said.“They are not registered with the state government. As we have no Chinese company on the list, we do not know the number of companies and how many banana trees they are growing,” he added.U Naw Li, a state parliamentarian from Waingmaw township, said there are over 100,000 acres of Chinese banana plantations in the state as part of the government’s poppy substitution programme.","/news/kachin-fighting-scaring-investors-official.html"
"22",22,"China proposals new infrastructure projects in Myanmar",2018-06-12,"Business","China has proposed a list of infrastructure projects to be implemented along the China-Myanmar economic corridor. The projects are expected to meet basic infrastructure needs in Myanmar as well as enhance China’s strategic footprint within the country.                         Last week, a Chinese delegation led by Yang Haodong, Party Secretary of the Lincang Municipal Committee, presented the proposal to officials from the Directorate of  Investment and Company Administration (DICA) and Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI).          The list of projects includes construction of Kwanlon Bridge and a highway and railroad connecting Chinshwehaw and Lashio in Shan State.The Chinese also proposed approving Chinshwehaw as an international border gate and construction of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the town as part of efforts to boost trade and tourism between China and Myanmar. Cross border agriculture cooperation between the two countries was also discussed.The China-Myanmar economic corridor was established late last year as part of a wider push to enhance cooperation between the two countries. The economic corridor, which authorities say takes into account Myanmar’s national development plan and its actual needs, starts in China’s Yunnan Province and extends into Mandalay, Yangon and Rakhine, where the Chinese are also discussing the construction of a port and SEZ in Kyaukphyu.The authorities of both countries hope this will connect all the large China-backed projects along the route and boost development in Myanmar.The proposal is also a further development of China-Myanmar cooperation under the Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative. During her China trip last year, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi agreed to participate in the initiative, which includes more than 60 countries. Since then though, critics in the country have voiced concerns regarding Myanmar’s involvement in B&R. There are worries about China’s influence over Myanmar sovereignty and rising debt levels, for example.Lincang linkNevertheless, both governments have agreed to cement the economic corridor and further enhance economic ties with each other. Now, the authorities are also working towards signing an agreement to build up tourism in Lashio and Lincang, which is located southwest of Yunnan, according to Dr Maung Maung Lay, UMFCCI vice president, who attended the meeting with the Lincang delegation.“If it is a good proposal and beneficial and convenient for us after it is considered by the experts and the government, we will not make any objections to the agreement as we also need support to develop the Myanmar economy, especially near the border areas,” he said.“Myanmar cannot avoid the B&R initiative and it will have to use China’s involvement as an opportunity to negotiate deals that will be to the country’s benefit. These are good proposals if they are implemented well,” said economist U Zaw Pe Win.Peace process In fact, accepting the plans submitted by Lincang could help Myanmar’s ongoing peace process by generating economic growth within the more problematic areas along the border such as Kokang and Wa, which are unrecognised and self-administered states in Myanmar located in Shan.“There is nothing to lose by cooperating with Lincang. As the projects may yield job opportunities and economic growth for the Kokang and Wa people, peace may actually be achieved,” said U Zaw Pe Win.With the exchange of trade and culture, economy, social lives will be improved. If social lives are improved, armed conflicts will be solved, Dr. Maung Maung Lay said.“We need to be cautious when negotiating the details of the deals but overall if the projects provide jobs, security will be better and undesired drug issues can be eliminated,” he said.For now, the authorities are considering the projects and a list of approved projects will be announced once they are confirmed, said U Than Aung Kyaw, deputy director general at DICA told The Myanmar Times.","/news/china-proposals-new-infrastructure-projects-myanmar.html"
"23",23,"Biographer: Animosity toward US drives Philippine president",2018-06-04,"Opinion","The author of the first biography of Rodrigo Duterte says the maverick Philippine president was gravitating toward China partly because of a personal animosity toward the United States and its criticisms of his human rights record.                         Jonathan Miller, Asia correspondent for Britain’s Channel 4 News, spent more than a year interviewing Duterte’s family, Cabinet members, supporters and critics to compile a biography largely in the words of Filipinos. It’s called “Duterte Harry,” a nickname Duterte earned during 22 years as the gun-toting mayor of southern Davao city. It’s also a play on the Clinton Eastward movie title “Dirty Harry.”          The British journalist said Duterte would like the Philippines to be part of new sphere that included China and Russia and abandon the old alliances including with the United States, the country’s former colonial power.China’s greatest appeal to the 72-year-old Philippine leader for a realigned relationship was money, Miller said.“The Chinese have actually promised a lot of investment and, although Duterte in the past has not been known for his infrastructure work, there are few countries in Southeast Asia that are in more need of investment and infrastructure than the Philippines – they need rail and road transport desperately,” Miller told The Associated Press in Canberra during a book signing.“He’s looking for a lot of Chinese money in that, but he’s also doing it to punish the US and he’s got a personal chip on his shoulder over the United States, which has criticised him for his human rights abuses,” Miller said.“He values China because they don’t criticise his human rights stuff,” he added.Many Filipinos are unsettled by Duterte moving away from the United States and closer to China, which aggressively contests the Philippines’ territorial claims in the South China Sea.“The move toward China alarms a lot of Filipinos who love America more than any other country in the world,” Miller said.Duterte’s gripes with the United States include being refused a visa, apparently because of State Department alarm at death squads that operated in Davao when he was mayor, Miller said.The International Criminal Court is conducting a preliminary probe into extrajudicial killings during Duterte’s signature war-on-drugs policy despite the president withdrawing his country from the court’s jurisdiction. A Filipino lawyer has complained that the anti-drugs campaign could amount to crimes against humanity.Miller suspects the slayings of suspected drug users and pushers “represents the largest loss of life in Southeast Asia since Pol Pot,” the leader of the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime that killed millions in Cambodia in the late 1970s.More than 4000 mostly urban poor suspects have been killed by police – a staggering death toll officials blame on the suspects fighting back. Human rights watchdogs have cited much higher numbers of fatalities, which the government disputes.Duterte denies condoning summary killings and has lashed out at critics, including former President Barack Obama, Western governments and UN human rights officials who have raised alarm over the killings.Miller’s book notes that Duterte has publicly derided Obama, Pope Francis and the author with a favoured “son of a whore” insult, while declaring his approval for President Donald Trump.In Canberra, Miller described Duterte as an admitted liar, thin-skinned, narcissistic, vengeful, angry and deeply misogynistic.The book cites a 1998 psychologist’s report used by Duterte’s former wife in a marriage annulment court application that described Duterte as having a narcissistic personality disorder with aggressive features.The diagnosis was drawn from the wife’s testimony. His daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio told the author that her father had been chivalrous in not contesting the report and allowing the marriage to end in a country that does not recognise divorce.Miller approached Duterte to be interviewed for the biography. Duterte referred Miller to staff to set an appointment, but staff never did.Duterte’s top aide summoned the US ambassador in February to discuss a global threat assessment by American intelligence agencies that mentioned the Philippine leader along with dangers facing democracy in Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand.The US report said “autocratic tendencies” are expected to deepen in some governments in Southeast Asia and mentioned that Duterte has suggested he could suspend the constitution, declare a “revolutionary government” and impose nationwide martial law.Duterte’s foreign policy critics argue his administration has not done enough to defend his country’s sovereignty in the South China Sea and argue it has been far too soft on China.The Russian navy has visited Manila three times since Duterte vowed to diversify the country’s ties away from the United States and toward China and Russia.

The report claimed that with the influx of Chinese migrants and the increase of Chinese investment, the traditional culture of Mandalay is disappearing; Mandalay’s economy is now in China’s hands; and the city is depicted as “Mandalay, Yunnan”.The report distorts Mandalay’s history and reality and turns a blind eye to the important contribution Chinese made to Mandalay and Myanmar’s development. It is based on few individual interviews and entirely groundless materials that are scraped together, producing most irresponsible conclusions. It intends to cause alienation among Myanmar ethnic groups and harm China-Myanmar pauk-phaw friendship. We express great concern and strong opposition to this report.Throughout history, Chinese in Myanmar, as an important factor of strengthening China-Myanmar friendly cooperation, have always been a firm force for promoting Myanmar’s harmony, stability, development and prosperity. They have never done anything to harm Myanmar or its people’s interests, but they suffered a great loss from anti-Chinese movements in the last century. This tragedy should not be repeated. The AP report instigates antagonism between Chinese and other ethnic groups in Myanmar, which runs counter to the national reconciliation policy promoted by the Myanmar government. We must be vigilant to avoid this tendency.We notice that the above-mentioned report is from AP, which leads us to wonder the purpose of this media in concocting the report. We hope our Myanmar friends will stay alert to remarks that instigate antagonism among Myanmar ethnic groups and harm China-Myanmar relations, and see clearly the evil intentions behind such reports.China and Myanmar are linked by mountains and waters and our people enjoy special bonds. We are friendly neighbours and a community of shared future. We have frequent exchanges at all levels with our cooperation deepening in all fields. We are building the Belt and Road Initiative and China-Myanmar Economic Corridor together, bringing new development opportunities. I believe that Myanmar Chinese, as the “bridge” of China-Myanmar friendly cooperation, will play a greater role in helping Myanmar’s peace process and national reconciliation as well as promoting economic development and people’s livelihoods, thus improving the well-being of Myanmar people.Qi Qihead of media and public affairsChinese Embassy, YangonEditor’s note: Reading your letter, we noticed that there seemed to be some misunderstanding: Every story in our paper stands on its own depending on the source and the way we edit it.

"25",25,"Visitors damage coral reefs on Cocks Comb",2018-05-03,"National News","Ninety percent of the coral reefs on a famous island, Cocks Comb have been damaged by the uncontrolled influx of visitors during the past two years, U Phyo Wai Yarzar, advisor of the Myanmar Tourism Marketing Association told The Myanmar Times on Wednesday.                         adCocks Comb Island is just off the coast of Kawthaung and part of the Myeik archipelago in the Andaman Sea. It is a limestone atoll without a beach, but with a stunning lagoon shaped like a heart.           “Almost 90pc of the coral reefs on the island are dead due to over 700 tourists visiting the place every day,” he said. “Chinese and Thai tourists comprise the most visitors to the island.U Phyo Wai Yarzar urged authorities to act on limiting the number of people allowed to visit the island every day or the coral reefs might be permanently destroyed.“The environment will be destroyed when people use it beyond its capacity. That is why the authorities should limit the number of travellers to the island,” he said.Regulators should make sure that they control it in such a way that it balances the impact on the tourism industry and the impact on the environment. “We cannot do anything once the coral reefs die because if will take many years for coral to flourish again. So we have to wait for a long time before the island becomes attractive again, thus there must be proper management of the island,” he said. The number of foreign visitors that came to Kawthaung  increased by 12,000 in March compared to the same period last year, according to the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism, and one of their favourite destinations is Cocks Comb Island. These numbers are those entering with visas, not including day-return visitors through border crossings, the ministry added. Cocks Comb Island is easily accessible by day trip from Ranong province in Thailand, which is just a 90-minute ride, making it very easy for Thai tourists to jump across the border.Since last year, the international cruise liner, Star Cruise Libra carrying over 700 passengers has being visiting Myeik archipelago. Many other foreign yacht and cruise ship tours have a stopover in the archipelago. U Phyo Wai Yarzar said cruise ships should avoid landing in shallow water and must stay far away from the islands to prevent destruction of coral reefs. “Marine tourism in our country is just beginning compared with other countries. So we could say the beginning is not good, but luckily only one island has severe damage to coral reefs,” he said. “We have to study and learn our lesson on this one so we can prevent destruction of coral reefs on other islands,” he added. According to the ministry, it collects a US$100 (K134,400) entrance fee from each tourist for four nights and five days stay if they come on international cruise ships.The Myanmar Investment Commission only permits tourism on 12 of the over 800 islands in Myeik archipelago in Tanintharyi Region.Out of the 12 islands, one island already got the license for hotel operation and the government is studying proposals to allow construction of hotels on six more islands, U Nyo Aye director of the Hotels and Tourism Department of Tanintharyi Region said. “This can’t be managed by only one local department. We need the participation of other departments to prevent the destruction of coral reefs. The Tanintharyi government has released a directive that will take action against people who trade or destroy coral on the islands,” he said.","/news/visitors-damage-coral-reefs-cocks-comb.html"
"26",26,"Chinese influx transforming Myanmar’s quintessential city",2018-05-02,"National News","Myanmar’s last royal capital harboured the most learned Buddhist monks and exquisite artists, citizens speaking the most refined Burmese and cooks who prepared the best curries in the land. Mandalay was rhapsodised as the nation’s cultural core.                         Today, along the grand moat of the former royal palace, Chinese music rings out as people perform tai chi exercises, a sign of an uneasy transformation taking place in Myanmar’s second-largest city. This once quintessential Burmese metropolis, residents say, is losing its traditions as a massive influx of Chinese migrants reshapes it in their own likeness.          “I feel that I am no longer a resident of Mandalay,” says Nyi Nyi Zaw, a 30-year-old journalist, adding that problems between Myanmar and Chinese caused by the changing dynamics have become a staple of his reporting. “They (Chinese people) look like the residents. They have money, so they have the power.”This makeover of Mandalay – located about 300 kilometres from China’s Yunnan province and at the crossroads of trade, transport and smuggling routes – reflects a Chinese footprint across Southeast Asia that has grown alongside Beijing’s economic and military clout. And it is one that is expected to widen as China pushes forward with its One Belt, One Road initiative to link Eurasian nations via land and sea routes.Propelled by Beijing’s policy of encouraging Chinese enterprises to expand abroad as well as official Chinese government investment in its neighbours’ infrastructure, the influx has sparked a measure of prosperity in some impoverished Southeast Asian regions. But along with it has come local resentment, sometimes anger, at perceived Chinese aggressiveness, cultural insensitivity and environmental damage.Chinese have been drawn to Southeast Asia for centuries, with waves of migrants fleeing war, revolution and starvation in the first half of the 20th century. While most of them came with little more than the shirts on their backs, many of the latest migrants are arriving with cash and savvy.“Out of the 10 top entrepreneurs in Mandalay, seven are Chinese,” says Win Htay, vice president of the Mandalay Region Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He says Chinese in the city own everything from small noodle shops to expensive commercial buildings.He estimates some 60 percent of Mandalay’s economy, including the key industries, is now in Chinese hands.Next to Laos’ capital, Vientiane, Chinese are building a virtually new city on more than 300 hectares of government-provided land that is expected to cater to an influx of migrants coming to work on Chinese-backed infrastructure projects reshaping the once sleepy town on the banks of the Mekong River.Residents of Sihanoukville are calling Cambodia’s only seaport “China Town” as more Chinese corner real estate and settle in a country that has turned from the West toward Beijing, now its key political and economic supporter.Spearheaded by a surge of Chinese tourists, condominiums and second homes marketed to mainlanders are sprouting in the northern Thailand hub of Chiang Mai, along with both legal and illegal businesses catering to their needs. A tourist with no knowledge of Thai or English can now hire an unlicensed Chinese taxi driver or even a bodyguard.Chinese investment has increased sharply in Malaysia, sparking concerns over sovereignty. In addition to mega ventures including a US$100 billion (K133.1 trillion) property development project, Chinese state-linked firms have also bought assets linked to the indebted 1MDB state fund, which was set up by Prime Minister Najib Razak and is being investigated by the US and other countries for embezzlement and money laundering. Opposition leaders have used the influx of Chinese money as an issue in the May 9 general election, warning that the government is selling off the country – a claim dismissed by Najib.In Mandalay, anti-Chinese jibes have become a staple of workaday conversation. Cartoons, comedy routines and literature label the country the “Chinese Republic of the Union of Myanmar” and the city as “Mandalay, Yunnan.” A popular song – “The Death of Mandalay” – laments what Mandalay has become: “The city where I was born is no longer there/Who are these people in the city?”While a Chinese community has long existed in Mandalay, a new wave flocked to snap up swaths of cheap vacant land following massive fires that tore through the city’s core in the 1980s. As isolationist Myanmar opened up in the 1990s, Chinese entrepreneurs also took advantage of low interest rates at home and high ones in Myanmar to invest in real estate. Others are involved in shadier areas such as the jade trade and narcotics trafficking.Since foreigners are not allowed to own land or enjoy other privileges, a large but unknown number of Chinese have obtained Myanmar citizenship through bribes to Myanmar immigration officials or outright forgery of documents, Myanmar businessmen and local journalists say.The result has been soaring real estate values that have forced many locals to move to the city’s outskirts.“If we can’t enact laws and take effective action on immigration, we will see a continuation of the Chinese influx because this area is good for them,” says Win Htay, who also heads a large sugar company.The ease with which Chinese are able to illegally obtain citizenship contrasts with the plight of Rakhine’s Muslim minority group at the heart of an ongoing refugee crisis, who despite having lived in Myanmar for generations are denied citizenship.Some take a balanced view of the Chinese presence in Mandalay, frequently reported as high as 50 percent of the city’s 1.2 million inhabitants, although estimates are unreliable given the undocumented status of many and depending on how assimilated ethnic Chinese are counted.“As a native I am not so concerned about Mandalay changing because of the Chinese. The world is becoming a global village,” said Tin Maung, managing director of the Royal Tun Thitsar Company. “Races mix all the time, but it is important that all are loyal to the country.”The Chinese presence in Mandalay and Myanmar is simply a natural outcome of intensified and positive relations with Southeast Asia, said Zhu Xianghui, associate professor at the Institute of Myanmar Studies of Yunnan University.He said concerns by Myanmar nationalists that their country is under threat of Chinese expansionism is “an overreaction from a poor country.”In response to questions about illegal immigration, the Foreign Affairs Office of Yunnan in China said it “always urged those going overseas to abide by local laws and customs.”While some of the regional migration is driven by Chinese government-backed policies, other migrants are aided by the age-old “guanxi,” the informal networks through which Chinese from a particular locality or clan have moved abroad. These networks aid and ease the entry of those following them into a foreign environment.Some simply come on their own, seeking a better, freer life outside China.Qing Dai, a prominent author and environmental activist who now calls Chiang Mai home, says she enjoys the absence of an internet firewall in Thailand, clean food and water, and being among “nice, peaceful people,” some of whom she helps through charities.Living in a rural area outside the city, Qing Dai says she has not yet encountered Thais averse to her countrymen. “But when I travel here and there, I do see the impolite, following-no-rules, arrogant Chinese and I feel ashamed for that,” she says. “We have a long way to go before China’s true modernisation is complete.”Now that China has urged its citizens to go out into the world, it’s only natural that many will choose to “follow their dreams,” says Aranya Siriphon, an anthropologist at Chiang Mai University.“That’s what we humans do,” she says. “But we have to be able to manage the negative aspects of these dreams.”","/news/chinese-influx-transforming-myanmars-quintessential-city.html"
"27",27,"Zay Kabar Co partners Chinese to develop one-stop bazaar in Mingaladon",2018-04-23,"Business","Myanmar conglomerate Zay Kabar Company and Chinese developer Zhejiang Luding Investment Co have signed an agreement to jointly develop a bazaar in Mingaladon township.                          Designs for the project, which will involve the development of a wholesale and retail market, residential units and office buildings across 124 acres of land, have been submitted to the Yangon City Development Committee (YCDC) and Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) for the necessary approvals.           Construction is expected to begin after the MIC approves a grant for the project. Both companies have committed a total of $700 million to develop the project. The idea to develop the bazaar came about after the Ministry of Construction approved the construction of a 40.5 kilometer highway linking Strand Road in downtown Yangon to the Yangon-Mandalay highway. One of the advantages of the highway is that it will reduce traveling time between downtown Yangon and Yangon International Airport, which is in Mingaladon, to just 20 minutes during peak hour traffic. Soon, Yangon residents can also make use of the highway to visit the Mingaladon Bazaar, which “will be a one-stop shopping bazaar in Mingaladon,” said U Khin Shwe, chair of Zay Kabar Company.“The Mingaladon Bazaar will provide consumers with an option to buy everything they need in one area as traffic congestion and space constraints in the downtown area sometimes prevent them from doing so.”Zay Kabar will work with the China’s Zhejiang Luding Investment Co, which is expected to provide the financing and technological know-how, to develop the project.“In Myanmar, borrowing rates are as high as 13 percent but in China, the rate is just 1pc-3pc. As such, we need to partner with a Chinese company which is willing to invest the needed capital into the project,” said U Khin Shwe. Besides the Mingaladon Bazaar,  Zay Kabar was also developing a real estate project near the Mya Yeik Nyo Royal Hotel, which it also owns, at Bahan township. The real estate project, which is expected to include twelve 24-storey buildings, received approval last June. However, the project suspended by the Yangon City Development Committee since March 14 due to its proximity to Kokkine reservoir.Potential damage to Kokkine could result in water shortages to nine townships in Yangon, including Bahan, Dagon, Kamayut, Mayangone, Tamwe, Sanchaung, Ahlone, Kyeemyindaing, and Mingalar Taung Nyunt. These include townships in which Shwedagon Pagoda and Yangon General Hospital are located.","/news/zay-kabar-co-partners-chinese-develop-one-stop-bazaar-mingaladon.html"
"28",28,"China’s ‘Belt & Road’ project gains momentum from Kunming to Kenya",2018-04-20,"National News","China's massive build programme to recreate trade routes stretching from Asia to Africa and Europe is gaining momentum.                         Since President Xi Jinping’s flagship Belt and Road project was announced about five years ago, it gave impetus to billions of dollars of Chinese investment – some of which were already in the pipeline for several years – to build railways, roads, ports and power plants.          The programme isn’t without controversy: debt risk is rising, an influx of Chinese workers has fuelled tension with locals, and there are worries about China’s dominance in the region. And not all of the projects have succeeded.“It’s been a mixed bag so far,” said Michael Kugelman, a senior associate for South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. “There have certainly been success stories, and there will be more of them too, but there have also been setbacks.”With many projects in various stages of development, measuring the success and potential benefits can be tricky. Here’s a list of projects that analysts who track China’s Belt and Road investments say will provide the most economic impact to countries by unlocking trade routes:Myanmar’s Kyaukpyu pipeline:The US$1.5 billion (K2 trillion) oil pipeline that runs from Kyaukpyu to Kunming began operations last year, allowing crude supplies from the Middle East and Africa to reach China faster as shipments no longer need to be transported through the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea. The pipeline is designed to carry 22 million tonnes of crude a year, representing about 5 percent of China’s annual oil imports. Talks are also ongoing about building a $7.3 billion deep-water port, which would be China’s largest investment in the nation. Along with a natural gas pipeline, the project represents an alternative route for energy imports and an important access point for goods shipped via the Indian Ocean, said Andrew Small, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, and author of “The China-Pakistan Axis.”Pakistan’s Gwadar Port:Sharing a border with China, Pakistan has projects that are among the most developed of the Belt and Road Initiative. The Gwadar deep-sea port and a 1865-mile- (3000 kilometre)-long corridor of roads and railways links China with the Arabian Sea. Transshipment from the port has begun, giving China’s western Xinjiang province closer access to a port than Beijing. It’s located at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, just outside the Straits of Hormuz, near shipping routes that accommodate more than 17 million barrels of oil per day and a large quantity of bulk, break-bulk and containerised cargo. With China expected to increase oil imports from the Middle East, Gwadar is seen as a potential trade route, said Hasnain Malik, head of equities research at Exotix Capital in Dubai.Asia Pacific rail links:China has a plan to connect Southeast Asian countries with the southwest region of Yunnan through a series of high-speed railways. There are three routes planned: a central one that runs through Laos, Thailand and Malaysia to reach Singapore; a western route through Myanmar; and an eastern one through Vietnam and Cambodia. Projects are at various stages of development, with construction on the Thailand and Laos legs already progressing. The plan represents some of the most important and high impact of China’s rail investments, said Small. In Indonesia, the $6 billion Jakarta-Bandung project is a flagship of President Joko Widodo’s infrastructure programme and expected to cut the travel time between the two traffic-clogged cities to 40 minutes, from about three hours by car. The project has so far stalled because of disputes over land clearance.Kenya railways:China is replacing decrepit Colonial-era trains with new and faster ones in African countries from Ethiopia to Senegal. One of the key projects is the Standard Gauge Railway that links Kenya’s port city of Mombasa to landlocked neighbours including Rwanda and Uganda via a network of high speed lines. The $3.8 billion passenger and cargo link between Mombasa and Kenya’s capital Nairobi started last year. It cuts the journey time by about half to 5 hours, while also reducing the cost of transporting freight.Pakistan’s Thar coalPakistan is seeking to extract coal in the Thar desert at one of the world’s biggest known deposits of lignite, a lower-grade brown version of the fuel. The project includes the building of power plants to expand electricity capacity in a country that faces chronic shortages. The first phase, which will add 660 megawatts of power, will be completed next year and can be scaled to 5000 megawatts to make it the largest cluster of electricity production in Pakistan.– Bloomberg","/news/chinas-belt-road-project-gains-momentum-kunming-kenya.html"
"29",29,"B&R: Bonanza or nightmare for Myanmar?",2018-04-11,"Business, Opinion","Despite its growing prominence internationally, China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is facing a host of challenges. Unless these are addressed, Beijing will find the BRI ending up more a nightmare than a bonanza.                         Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative has attracted a great deal of global attention. The United States and some European Union countries are apprehensive that BRI signals China’s attempt to dominate the two-thirds of the world’s population, and 40 percent of global trade, accounted for by BRI countries.          BRI links China with faster-growing emerging markets, providing an alternative to slow-growing, increasingly protectionist Western markets, and outlets for its abundant domestic savings and industrial excess capacity. Developing infrastructure and relationships in BRI countries will help private and state companies venturing abroad, where they will learn to compete internationally and thus “become stronger”, while also moving China “closer to [the world’s] centre stage”, as President Xi wishes.But funding infrastructure projects is always a challenge. They are large, capital-intensive and expensive, with long construction and payback periods, thus involving high risk. They are also characterised by externalities or spillovers: because social exceed private costs and benefits, left to private investors there will be under-investment.Because of this, public funding is the most common funding model for infrastructure projects. Governments can borrow at lower cost than private entities, given an implicit sovereign guarantee against default. They have a longer time-horizon, and investing to prioritise social benefits in instances of “market failure” is their responsibility.Consortia are also a popular model, involving public-private partnerships, and multilateral and regional agencies, such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Consortia can raise more capital and obtain more expertise from diverse multiple sources, and reduce the risk for any individual lender/ investor as well as the borrower/ project.In developing countries capital is scarce, so at a premium, while borrowing from cheaper foreign sources requires repayment in foreign exchange, adding currency risk. Governance risk arises from governments often lacking the expertise to evaluate, implement and monitor projects, and leakage through corruption is common, increasing cost, delay and quality problems.Political and other risksThere is also political risk, since the distribution of costs and benefits may not be equitable, and social unrest may result from disputes over land appropriation and compensation, labour, and environmental consequences such as harm to local farming, forests and fisheries. Authoritarian governments are not transparent, and may use coercion to resolve disputes, while democratic governments may change and demand changed terms.BRI countries pose additional high country risks. Many are low-income so lack capital, human resources, and capacity to earn export revenues to pay for imports of materials and equipment for BRI projects, posing high risks of debt and currency crisis. There may be domestic political or economic turmoil, unstable or unpopular governments, and contentious relations with neighbours sharing or affected by projects like dams.A recent study by the Centre for Global Development identified eight countries where the immediate marginal impact of BRI projects in the lending pipeline would raise their debt-to-GDP and debt-to-China ratios to “high risk” levels.Even without such debt concerns, China’s eagerness for infrastructure projects in BRI countries may not mesh with perceived local needs and could heighten political risk for host governments who collaborate with them.For example, in relatively developed Malaysia, one business person I interviewed said: “Most of the OBOR initiatives in Malaysia are not positive for the country. The large infrastructure projects like railways and ports are strategic for China but will be white elephants for Malaysia. The deal terms are poorly contrived for Malaysia. But Malaysia only has itself to blame for letting its politicians make such deals.”Chinese business modelThe preferred Chinese infrastructure business model does not help win local support, based as it is on exporting Chinese equipment, materials, management and labour to the recipient country so there is minimal local content, job creation, training and supplier linkages.  This adds to the perception that BRI projects are for China’s rather than host countries’ benefit.As another business respondent put it: “The Chinese are relentless in pursuit of profit/ advantage without considering negative implications for local communities.” Chinese companies have been accused of poor business practices, such as undercutting local suppliers, failing to honour contracts and to comply with local regulations, while delivering inferior quality and reliability, such as plagued Chinese-built power plants in Indonesia.Another business person familiar with BRI projects told me: “Big Chinese companies are unfamiliar with private enterprise and market economies, because they are all linked to the Chinese government and follow a top-down mode of operation. They are comfortable only with G2G deals.”Chinese companies’ preference for working through local political leaders, rather than directly with communities affected by their projects, may mean that project social costs are not adequately calculated and compensated for. This results in protests which can stall projects, as has happened with the Myitsone dam and Kunming-Kyaukphyu railway and oil-and-gas pipeline in Myanmar.If the local leaders China works with are incompetent, corrupt, greedy or unpopular, this rubs off on them, while dissatisfaction with Chinese projects can rub off on the local leaders who collaborate with them — in both cases, heightening political risk.China’s creeping arroganceIn Sri Lanka, the government’s leasing Hambantota port to a Chinese state-owned company in payment of debts incurred for its construction contributed to its local electoral losses in February 2018. And in Indonesia, there are rumours that President Jokowi’s encouragement of Chinese investments could undermine his prospects for reelection in 2019.Chinese companies also lack experience operating in ethnically and culturally diverse countries, and are frequently accused of lacking respect for local practices and customs, such as observation of Muslim prayer times and the fasting month. They show no interest in learning about or understanding local populations (or eating their food), displaying what one of my respondents called “unconscious arrogance due to their superior feeling of the success of China”.This can backfire on local ethnic Chinese populations in Southeast Asia, who already dominate business in some countries, are favoured as local partners by Chinese companies, and would be resented if seen to benefit disproportionately from China investments. Other local Chinese worry that the unpopularity of high-profile Chinese projects could exacerbate latent anti-Chinese feelings that could adversely affect them.What can China do to correct image?What can China do to counter these destabilising negative perceptions of BRI projects? First, Chinese companies should undertake only projects which are financially, economically and politically viable, and environmentally and socially sustainable. Including such calculations means many projects will not make the cut. Second, they should partner with other lenders and investors, from different countries. Diversification reduces risk, and dilutes the image of being Chinese.Third, they should make investment decisions together with the host country, not unilaterally, to ensure that the projects are “mutually advantageous” as claimed. Fourth, they can help recipient countries to repay their loans by earning foreign exchange, for example, by establishing industrial zones for companies relocating labour-intensive manufacturing from China, and by developing markets in China for their exports.Fifth, they should employ better public relations. This includes being transparent and communicating with local media and host communities about project rationales. And they should reduce high visibility opening ceremonies should include other foreign partners and investors as well as more locals, and projects should be “branded” not as “Chinese” but as “national” projects, to reduce fears of a loss of sovereignty.Sixth, they should employ locals as labour and management, provide technical and skills training, and work with all stakeholders, not just the government or party-in-power. In addition, they should train, encourage and expect their Chinese employees to understand, respect and engage with local cultures. All this requires fundamental changes in corporate culture and business model.Be ‘less Chinese’In short, to be successful, BRI projects should become less Chinese. While this might seem to run counter to China’s hope for “soft power”, the billions invested will otherwise not deliver, and may even undermine, its foreign policy goals.Today, with a massive US$57 billion investment in energy and infrastructure projects in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the Pakistan government has to employ a 15,000-strong military force to protect Chinese workers. Despite this, in February 2018, a Chinese shipping executive was shot dead in his car in Karachi in “a targeted attack”. If China does not learn to adapt to life outside the Great Wall, the Belt and Road risks turning into a foreign policy nightmare, not a bonanza.Linda Lim is NTUC Professor of International Economic Relations 2018 at the S Rajaratnam School of International Relations (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

The draft will include the various phases of implementation and a proposed timeline, Daw Kalayar Pyi Wai Shan said during a meeting with the Yangon Gold Entrepreneur Association.           The gold exchange will first focus on drawing local traders and building up domestic volumes in the initial phase, following which the exchange will be developed into an international gold trading market.If successfully established, the Myanmar gold exchange will be the first in Myanmar, where gold is mainly bought and sold in its physical form at wholesale markets such as those located Shwe Bon Thar Street, Yangon.It will also consolidate the trading of gold onto a single platform and align Myanmar with its regional peers, said U Aung Kaung Myat, director of Weint Sein Gold Shop.“Both the Shanghai and Hong Kong gold exchanges were developed for the domestic markets in the initial years before becoming international commodity exchanges. So, it will be good for the Myanmar gold market to upgrade to an exchange first before going international later,” said U Nay Htet, a gold trader.          draft-2.jpg                Time to set upThis won’t be the first time talk of setting up a gold exchange in the country has surfaced. And, it won’t be easy to implement.“[Typically], the trading of gold on an exchange can be done physically or by buying its contract in derivatives for diverse investment purposes. To setup such commodity exchanges you would need an exchange house, clearing house and a governing body for every transaction to be legal and transparent,” said Ms Ana Victoria, regional director of Inter Pan, an Indonesia-headquartered brokerage.Inter Pan is licensed by the Jakarta Futures Exchange and is a pioneer brokerage in Myanmar which provides gold futures trading services.The Myanmar Gold Entrepreneurs Association has already met with the Securities Exchange Commission of Myanmar (SECM). “We have invited them to submit a proposal for the forming of a gold exchange,” said U Htay Chun, a member of the SECM. Last year, Haywood Cheung Tak-hay, president of the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society, Hong Kong Gold Exchange, said Hong Kong will provide the necessary assistance to help Myanmar establish its first gold exchange.","/news/draft-blueprint-national-gold-exchange-be-ready-month-end.html"

"32",32,"Quality over quantity",2018-03-05,"Lifestyle","Myat Su Tun Lwin is serious about supporting local manufacturers.                          Myat Su Tun Lwin can recall a time when every household in the country owned a laphet ouk, a distinct flower shaped lacquerware bowl designed for serving Myanmar’s national dish – laphet thoke or tea leaf salad. It was custom to present the disassembled salad, each of its ingredients contained in the bowl’s separate compartments, when welcoming guests to the home.           But in the decades since her childhood, the laphet ouk has slowly vanished from Burmese homes.“Now you won’t find a house in the country who doesn’t own Chinese made kitchenware,” she said.Seeing locally-made products slowly make way for cheaper, mass-produced, imported products prompted Myat Su Tun Lwin, 38, to open her shop Dar Doepyi (This is our country).Located in Thingangyun township in Yangon, Dar Doepyi opened early last year and sells clothes, fabrics, lacquerware and food items sourced from more than 300 producers and craftspeople from across the country. By sourcing products directly and cutting out suppliers Myat Su Tun Lwin can not only sell her products cheaper, but also vouch for their quality - every product bears the name of its manufacturer. Vanishing industriesIt was on a search for weavers in Sagaing Region that Myat Su Tun Lwin began to realise just how far Myanmar’s traditional industries had fallen. Ton village once supported a thriving weaving industry famous for producing quality handkerchiefs.  On a recent visit, Myat Su Tun Lwin discovered there wasn’t one weaver left in the whole village.“The village’s handkerchief weaving enterprise has gradually disappeared,” she said. “The sesame harvest season comes along and all of the villagers are harvesting, because it gives them much more income than weaving.”Products, like those produced in Ton village, have, in recent years, had to compete against cheaper counterparts from China and Japan. Facing rising transport costs, small manufacturers produce lesser quality products faster and sell them at discount rates in order to remain competitive. Eventually, villagers look for work in higher paying industries, such as farming, while young people move to Myanmar’s large urban centres to look for work.One weaving house owner told Myat Su Tun Lwin that she wanted her children to work at bank or move to a big city to work at a company. She didn’t pass on the craft to her children because “they wouldn’t flourish by doing this business.”          quality-2.jpg                Intervention neededSince 2011, the lifting of sanctions and economic liberalization have seen foreign businesses flood into Myanmar seeking to capitalize on cheap labor and its untapped market of consumers. While the government has welcomed this new era of foreign investment, craft industry leaders are calling on the government to step in and protect local producers. Dr Aung Thein, the president of the Myanmar Industries Association, said that Myanmar needs a government body which would assist the development of local entrepreneurs who make popular products.The government does this to some extent already, he said, but there needs to be more emphasis on modern marketing techniques, such as online, and reference to those successful strategies employed by neighbouring countries.“By this way, handicraft enterprises can be protected from disappearing and can also be promoted which would lower the numbers of young people leaving their villages because they would be able to work,” he said. Despite the best efforts of local producers, it’s a reality that certain parts of products have to be sourced from abroad, says Myat Su Tun Lwin.“No product is totally made with Myanmar raw materials. Buttons come from China and lace comes from Thailand.”Importantly this doesn’t seem to worry tourists - Dar Doepyi’s biggest customers. Instead, they’re more focused on the quality of the product than where it is from. She advises her suppliers to make a certain number of hi-quality products to sell as souvenirs as well as standard quality products which are sold for everyday use.Myat Su Tun Lwin points to the way many traditional textile manufacturers have established a market for high-quality textiles among tourists as a model for other local industries. Tourists are prepared to pay more for better quality products, she said, adding, other traditional industries should be looking at this as a model for the future. Dar Doepyi is located at Bulding 6, Room 1, Thanthumar Road, 24th Quarter, Thuwunna township, Yangon.

"33",33,"Samsung pulls the plug on Myanmar: Korean media ",2018-03-01,"Business","Poor infrastructure, govt’s inaction on economic reforms, political uncertainties and red tape - the Samsung episode is indicative of the problems smothering investors and businesses in Myanmar.                         SOUTH Korean multinational Samsung Electronics has reportedly “made a final decision” not to build a manufacturing plant in Myanmar due to the lack of infrastructure, the government’s inaction on economic reforms, anxiety on a worsening bureaucracy and political uncertainties. An academic argued that the Samsung episode is indicative of the Myanmar problems for Western investors and corporations.          The Korea Times reported that sources from Samsung, including a Myanmar-based source from the firm, said that Nay Pyi Taw has continued to ask them to invest and build in the country over recent years, and they have reviewed the situation before coming to the decision, which was made after a recent country visit by Samsung executives.The eletronics giant currently has three production plants in Vietnam - one for TVs and household appliances in Ho Chi Minh and two for smartphones in Hanoi. In Yangon, the company operates a marketing branch under its subsidiary Thai Samsung Electronics, and has, for years, considered investing in manufacturing in the country.“Recently, a small group of Samsung officials, including a ranking executive from the head office, visited Myanmar and had a meeting with Myanmar officials.“After the meeting, Samsung decided not to make any investment as the Myanmar government demanded that Samsung construct power plants and roads [at the company’s own expense] that are essential to build and operate a factory,” the Korea-based media quoted a Myanmar-based source with direct knowledge about the matter saying.People expect that once Aung San Suu Kyi became the leader, there would be many positive changes on the economic front but so far little has changed. - A source from Samsung told Korea TimesPulling the plugThis is not the first vote of no confidence from the Korean electronics giant.While the firm won approval in early 2013 from the government to construct a factory in Yangon Region, it deferred the investment plan on the grounds that “the Myanmar government and Samsung have failed to iron out differences on key issues, such as land area, investment incentives and power supply.”But the reported decision to scrap its plan to build a production base would mean a final nail in the coffin.The Korea Times went on to claim that another source familiar with the matter who regularly visits Myanmar confirmed the cancellation of the investment, saying there are a couple of additional factors leading to the decision - the government’s inaction on economic reforms, political uncertainty and an unfavourable administration environment.“People expect that once Aung San Suu Kyi became the leader, there would be many positive changes on the economic front but so far little has changed.“Also, the county’s move toward decentralisation, driven by conflicts arising from many ethnic groups and different languages, are raising concerns that it will make the government’s decision-making process more complicated and inefficient,” the source was quoted saying.In response, Samsung’s company spokesperson denied that it has recently considered investment in the country.“In 2013, we considered building production lines for TVs in Myanmar but dropped the plan in the same year due to a lack of infrastructure, such as power and [industrial] water.”“We have never reviewed it again since then.”With wages rising in China, Indonesia and Vietnam, South Korean companies are looking to manufacture in Myanmar, according to Kim Young-sun, the Secretary General of the ASEAN-Korea Centre. Despite cheap labour, Myanmar’s poor infrastructure and a raft of other barriers seem to have deterred the world’s leading smartphone manufacturer from coming in.This is indicative of the Myanmar problems which Western corporations and multinationals face. There won't be an America and Europe-led FDI boom in Myanmar anymore. - Pietro Borsano, Shinawatra International UniversityIndicative of the problemsPietro Borsano, management and business law lecturer at Shinawatra International University who also teaches in Mandalay, said that Samsung’s episode sums up the issues Western corporations and multinationals face in the country.“There won't be an America and Europe-led FDI boom in Myanmar anymore. At the same time, the way the Chinese, Chinese-Thai and Chinese-Malaysian do business is quite specific and different from the Western world,” he told The Myanmar Times. Mr Borsano, who’s also an associate, attributed Samsung’s reported decision to a few factors. First off, Myanmar’s domestic market, which remains one of the poorest in ASEAN and internationally, is not a priority for the electronics multinational. “I assume Samsung intended to invest in a market penetration, rather than in a production localisation,” the lawyer said. The market in Myanmar for sophisticated smartphones, TVs, and appliances with cutting-edge technology has not yet emerged and it remains a price-driven market. The massive digitalisation of the country is all led by “no-frills Chinese smartphone producers.” And hence the market has little room left for Samsung to capture.“Chinese firms astonishingly reshaped the Myanmar market, especially if one considers the struggles Myanmar is still facing in terms of poor network services across the whole country. Nevertheless, Chinese firms were able to attract customers and widely cover the country. Oppo and Vivo shops can be easily found also in second and third tier Myanmar cities,” he commented. The massive digitalisation in Myanmar has all been led by no-frills Chinese smartphone producers. - Pietro Borsano, Shinawatra International UniversityMr Borsano also attributed the difficulties Samsung encounters to the broader economic context - lacklustre regulatory reforms, absence of effective corporate governance, burdensome bureaucracy and insufficiently competitive investment promotion compared to neighbouring countries.This is in line with what Mr Kim said: red tape is one of the challenges standing in the way of Korean investors in general. “One of the challenges when setting up factories here is the bureaucracy and lack of coordination between the government and municipalities. Having an agency that provides a one-stop service to help in the setting up of factories is very much necessary to incentivise companies to invest here,” he said. Such factor explains why a considerable number of Korean firms, including food company CJ Cheiljedang and Yojin Construction & Engineering, opened factories in Thilawa Special Economic Zone (SEZ), which boasts a streamlined bureaucracy.  But Samsung’s divestment is merely indicative of Western multinationals, according to Mr Borsano, who is upbeat about Myanmar’s attractiveness for other Asian investors. Myanmar’s growth potential and natural resources play a crucial role.“Myanmar is at a stage of development that makes it a very attractive market for Chinese firms. Undoubtedly, over the latest decade, China and Chinese firms have taken a remarkable advantage against their competitors in Myanmar; the Belt and Road Initiative is likely to further enhance Chinese investments in Myanmar. “We should ask which countries and consequently FDIs are better placed to enter and nurture their businesses in Myanmar. I will surely include China, Thailand, and Malaysia; and, for a few advanced technology equipments and components, such as healthcare and power plants, also Japan, Germany, South Korea and Italy,” he noted.The Myanmar Times has contacted Samsung Electronics for comment.","/news/samsung-pulls-plug-myanmar-korean-media.html"
"34",34,"Myanmar drawn into China’s shadow: report ",2018-02-27,"National News","Myanmar has been drawn into the sphere of influence of its superpower neighbour – China – advancing the Chinese geostrategic interests through the so-called “Guanxi” diplomacy as Western powers retreat from the country, a local think tank has said in a report.                         The Institute of Strategy and Policy (ISP)-Myanmar said in a report released in Yangon on Sunday.           The report comes at a time when Myanmar faces immense international pressure on its handling of the northern Rakhine State crisis, in which over 650,000 Muslims fled to neighbouring Bangladesh after deadly violence last year and the year before. ISP-Myanmar, a non-government policy and strategy think tank group that publishes Myanmar Quarterly journal, said in the report that diplomatic relations between Myanmar and China have deepened under the ruling NLD government, with increasing multi-layered Chinese engagement with diverse stakeholders in Myanmar through what is known as “Guanxi” diplomacy.Guanxi is a deep-rooted ideology in Chinese society that emphasises cultural dynamics based on personalised networks of influence, which ISP-M officials said encompass soft power diplomacy – not just to promote the Chinese image.“It asks the question whom you know. And based on that, it’s a calculated enhancement of building ties. It’s more than soft power diplomacy, not just to clean the Chinese image,” said Daw Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee, head of the China desk at ISP-M, the main author of the report.“It’s giving favour to the ones who can serve your long-term interests,” she said.Before 2010, the three pillars of Myanmar-China relations were engaging with the military regime, international pressure on the then-ruling military junta and Myanmar’s economic dependence on China.But the pillars have now changed as a new political landscape developed in Myanmar following some political reforms initiated by the military junta after 2010, with new players coming in and increased international attention and interest on the country. The reforms created anti-Chinese sentiment in terms of strategic investments in Myanmar as more countries slowly began to pour in investments and aid to the country.The report noted that the introduction of the Chinese multi-layered engagement strategy has pulled Myanmar closer into China’s sphere of influence, especially after the country came in for intense international criticism over Rakhine last year.While the West has always taken a values-based approach to Myanmar, China remains a staunch defender against possible threats of intervention from the international community on the Rakhine crisis.But the report noted that with its support for Myanmar’s peace process, foreign investment and diplomatic protection from international criticism, China will not likely give Myanmar a blank check.“It’s likely that China will bring Myanmar back into its sphere of influence and pursue its geo-strategic and economic interests through the Belt and Road Initiative,” said the report, highlighting the potential of China-financed mega projects in Myanmar.It also imposes an influence on Myanmar’s peace process, which is a top priority of the NLD government. For instance, the Chinese government’s facilitation paved the way for the attendance of a powerful bloc of armed ethnic groups that operates along the China-Myanmar border.“It is better if players in Myanmar can handle the peace process on their own instead of allowing China to become part of it,” said the ISP official.Also, with the NLD leadership failing so far to impress the public in economic growth, Myanmar’s dire need for foreign investment in infrastructure is creating a situation for China to take a bigger role and exercise more influence on the country’s economic development.“China also wants Myanmar’s support in its domestic and international affairs. One such thing includes its territorial claim in the South China Sea,” Daw Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee said.The author said China wants the easing out of local aggression and to gain support and possible willingness to share the governance and economic development model by which Myanmar’s neighbour has succeeded.“As Myanmar increasingly embraces China, there is a potential that Myanmar’s political and economic reforms could lead toward a Myanmar version of democracy with Chinese characteristics,” said the report.","/news/myanmar-drawn-chinas-shadow-report.html"
"35",35,"Mandalay chamber to focus on SME loan and Chinese investment",2018-02-19,"Mandalay & Upper Myanmar, Business","U Kyaw Min, newly elected chair of the Mandalay Region Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MRCCI), sees big potential for the region to draw Chinese investments and tap local talent for growth and development.                         Mandalay is Myanmar’s second largest city and often hailed as the country’s northern economic powerhouse.          “We have drawn up a one-year plan to help small and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs] gain access to funding for growth and facilitate foreign direct investments from China, which is the biggest investor in Mandalay,” he told The Myanmar Times during a recent interview. U Kyaw Min, who owns domestic business Sein & Mya Mattress and is a respected business leader in the city, has also served in the chamber for the past 15 years.He was elected as chair of the organisation last month, during its second round of elections since its 1991 establishment. Here is an excerpt of our interview with U Kyaw Min.Can you tell us about the new structure of the chamber? We have expanded the number of executive members to 110 from 61 to include 23 youths and 32 women. Around 20 percent of the old team were also retained. I believe the new composition of executive members will help improve and develop the MRCCI’s role in representing the interests of the private sector in Mandalay Region. How will the MRCCI support the Mandalay economy?We are in talks with the banks on ways to help SMEs gain access to loans without the need for collateral. One of the potential solutions is for banks to disburse loans to borrowers with the MRCCI acting as a third party guarantor in accordance with the law. The next step is to communicate more regularly with the regional government and build connections with foreign investors. This will help us improve and become more effective in our role as a bridge between the go ernment, investors and local firms. What is the current state of the Mandalay economy? What can be done to improve it?Even though we expected things to improve, the economy has not been doing very well compared to previous years. We should consider the barriers and challenges involved and how to remove them. One of the most urgent issues that must be dealt with is tax. The government must ensure businesses pay tax to enable more effective public spending. But there is also the need to relax the tax regulations. If taxes are too strictly enforced, the implications will be felt all the way at the grassroots level. But if the government levies lower tax burden on new business, many will come forward to pay. This will help establish a habit of paying taxes among businesses and generate regular income for the government. What level of foreign investments are you seeing in Mandalay? So far, the majority of investments in Mandalay are carried out by local firms with support from foreign investors, most of which are Chinese. Recently, we are seeing China’s investments flow into the Myotha Industrial Park as well as the hotel and tourism sector. There have been few Western investors here as they usually take years to carry out their market research and due diligence procedures, and Mandalay needs investments quickly to expand and grow.","/news/mandalay-chamber-focus-sme-loan-and-chinese-investment.html"
"36",36,"Devil will be in the detail for Belt and Road courts",2018-02-16,"Business","But as details have yet to emerge, it might be premature to judge.                         THE new Belt and Road courts could complement existing common law-based arbitration institutions and widen the choices for project parties, but the devil could be in the detail, such as the structure, composition of judges and governing rules, experts have warned.           In early February, the Chinese embassy in Yangon confirmed that Beijing will set up a Belt and Road dispute settlement mechanism involving new courts, while news media reported that three international commercial courts will be set up by China’s Supreme People’s Court in Xi’an, Shenzhen and Beijing. In Myanmar, the proposed Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Rakhine State is among the foremost mega projects in the Belt and Road Initiative. The proposed SEZ has huge implications on Rakhine’s development, Myanmar’s trade economy, foreign investments, infrastructure as well as human rights. U Kyaw Htin from CITIC Myanmar told The Myanmar Times on February 2 that they were only made aware of the development through news reports about the BRI courts, adding that since the parties involved are still in negotiations, the dispute settlement mechanism is not finalised.Beijing’s decision to create a new mechanism came under fire earlier, with an academic lambasting such arrangements as “essentially tools for corporations to restrict access to justice”. But there are lawyers in Myanmar who defended and supported the proposal....this initiative could be perceived in such way as suggesting that the vehicle might be controlled by Chinese courts and ultimately the Chinese government, depending on its structure. - Filip Lauwerysen, EuroCham More choices to settle disputeBodenheimer Herzberg, an international arbitration specialist in Europe, confirmed that when it comes to viability of the alleged plans, several well-established arbitration centres exist in the region, the ones in Singapore and Hong Kong being the most prominent. There are also alternatives such as Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre for Arbitration (KLRCA) in Malaysia or even existing institutions in mainland China, such as the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC). The arbitration awards issued under the rules of the established arbitration institutions do bring about the advantage of being enforceable in most countries under the ""New York Convention"".Filip Lauwerysen, chief executive of European Chamber of Commerce in Myanmar (EuroCham), outlined several prerequisites for the planned courts to be viable in the existing environment.“Foremost, the initiative should not be seen as an envisaged replacement of arbitration as a means of settling disputes but rather serves as a companion rather than a competitor to arbitration as it might be one more option among a suite of viable alternatives to resolve transnational commercial disputes,” he stated.The established arbitration institutions in Singapore and Hong Kong are embedded in a culture dominated by common law influence. This ignores that many countries in the region are based on civil law systems, including China. Setting up a court system might enable future parties to conduct proceedings also in Chinese without significantly higher costs if the infrastructure is provided.Furthermore, the establishment of an international court allows for new approaches both with regard to implication of costs and the introduction of other means of dispute resolution such as mediation. Especially with respect to the likely disputes in connection with the BRI, the advantage of a developed jurisprudence, rather than confidential arbitration, and the facilitated ability to join third parties to disputes might make this project very viable. With regard to enforcement, decisions by the courts might be appealing for non-Chinese parties when it comes to enforcement in China.Similarly, Dr William Wong, a Hong Kong senior counsel who advocated the city’s legal sector to capitalise on BRI opportunities, told The Myanmar Times that the proposal is meant to provide another choice for parties to resolve international commercial disputes.“Rather, like the Singaporean International Commercial Courts and the Singaporean Arbitration Centre, parties can opt in a court system or an arbitration route. It is meant to provide a wider range of choices for the parties. The establishment of a wide range of reputable disputes resolution infrastructures is to be welcomed,” the barrister noted.The proposal is only at an early stage, full details have to be worked out later. - Dr William Wong SC, BarristerAll depends on the detailsHowever, the EuroCham chief said that the question regarding to what extent such a court would be perceived as a neutral dispute settlement venue will depend largely on its set-up and the composition of judges, regional or international. “When looking at the foreseen structure, with Shenzhen covering the Maritime Silk Road, the court might also establish specialised competence in the field of maritime disputes.“In the Myanmar context, the general tensions and disputes between the local population on Chinese infrastructure projects are also to be considered. Having a court in China ruling over such disputes could be counterproductive.“I believe that this initiative could be perceived in such way as suggesting that the vehicle might be controlled by Chinese courts and ultimately the Chinese government, depending on its structure. Secondly, a more international setup could have been seen by establishing an ASEAN-Chinese arbitration panel or choosing a neutral third country arbitration centre or third country commercial court,” Mr Lauwerysen observed.Likewise, James Bridgeman SC, president of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, stated that an international judiciary could help secure impartiality and independence of the courts.“Parties to investment treaties and trade agreements require an effective dispute resolution mechanism that is independent, impartial, applies the rule of law and delivers enforceable determinations. How this is to be achieved is a matter for the parties themselves.“It could be achieved by establishing a permanent court sitting in one or more jurisdictions with an international judiciary. There was strong support for this approach in the EU in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership [TTIP] negotiations with the USA,” he explained.In the Myanmar context, the general tensions and disputes between the local population on Chinese infrastructure projects are also to be considered. Having a court in China ruling over such disputes could be counterproductive. - Filip Lauwerysen, EuroCham Regulatory powers at riskDaniel Aguirre, Greenwich University’s senior lecturer in law and former legal adviser of the International Commission of Jurists in Yangon, noted that the development is not surprising given how lucrative the investment arbitration market has become. Linking development projects along the BRI to a Chinese arbitration court would help China to establish a foothold in international arbitration market. But this would take a long time to set up and negotiate existing investment agreements between China and the countries involved.He highlighted that any new investment arbitration centre must be governed by rules that protect the ability of host countries to pass regulation protecting national development policies, human rights and the environment even if these conflict with the interests of Chinese investors. “States should not be pressured to sign away their legitimate regulatory powers in exchange for Chinese investment,” Dr Aguirre argued.Unfortunately, those eager to scrutinise the details and pass judgement will be disappointed. According to Dr Wong, the proposal is only at an early stage and more details have to be worked out later.States should not be pressured to sign away their legitimate regulatory powers in exchange for Chinese investment. - Dr Daniel Aguirre, Senior lecturer in law","/news/devil-will-be-detail-belt-and-road-courts.html"
"37",37,"China congress augurs well for Myanmar",2018-02-08,"Opinion","The19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held in Beijing in October, was a meeting of great importance that will have a profound influence on China and the rest of the world. The CPC’s goal at the national congress was to remain true to its aspirations and keep its mission firmly in mind, hold high the banner of “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” secure a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society, strive for the success of Chinese socialism in a new era, and work tirelessly to realise the great Chinese dream of national rejuvenation. The congress enshrined Xi Jinping’s “Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”, outlined the road map and schedule for developing China into a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful by mid-century, and provided guidelines on rejuvenating the nation.                         The congress reviewed the historical achievements in reform, opening up and socialist modernisation since the previous national congress. Over the past five years, China’s economy has maintained a medium-high growth rate. With gross domestic product rising from 54 trillion to 80 trillion yuan (US$8 trillion to $12 trillion/K15.93 quadrillion), China has maintained its position as the world’s second largest economy, contributing more than 30 percent of global economic growth and improving people’s lives. China has made major breakthroughs in reform, taken major steps in developing democracy and the rule of law, made notable progress in protecting the environment, and initiated a new stage in strengthening the armed forces. We have made all-round efforts in the pursuit of diplomacy. With this, Beijing has seen a further rise in China’s international influence, ability to inspire, and power to shape, and China has made great contributions to world peace and development. As stated in the report delivered by General Secretary Xi Jinping at the congress, “socialism with Chinese characteristics” has ushered in a new era in China’s development. It means that the Chinese people, who have overcome numerous challenges in the past century, have stood up, grown rich and are becoming strong, with brilliant prospects of rejuvenation to embrace. It means that scientific socialism is full of vitality in China, and that the banner of “socialism with Chinese characteristics” is flying high and proud for all to see. It means that the path, the theory, the system, and the culture of “socialism with Chinese characteristics” have kept developing, blazing a new trail for other developing countries to achieve modernisation. It offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence, a Chinese wisdom, and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing mankind.          Diplomacy for a new era In terms of China’s diplomacy for a new era, the report proposes that we follow a path of peaceful development and work to build a new form of international relations and a community of mankind with a shared future. China will uphold its fundamental foreign policy goal of preserving world peace and promoting development. China remains firm in its commitment to strengthening friendship and cooperation with other countries on the basis of the “Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence”, and to forging a new form of international relations built on mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation. The proposal for building a community of mankind with a shared future is based on the basic judgement made by China with regard to the world situation and the theme of the era. We believe that peace and development remain irreversible trends in the world, but as human beings we also have many common challenges to face. No country can address alone the challenges facing mankind, no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation. People from all countries should work together to build a community of mankind with a shared future, ensuring an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity.The report points out that China remains firm in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace. We respect the right of the people of all countries to choose their own development path. We endeavour to uphold international fairness and justice, and oppose acts that impose one’s will on others or interfere in the internal affairs of others as well as the practice of the strong bullying the weak. China will never pursue development at the expense of others, nor will China ever give up its legitimate rights and interests. No one should expect us to swallow anything that undermines our interests. China’s development does not pose a threat to any other country. China will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion. With regard to neighbouring countries and other developing countries, China will deepen relations with them in accordance with amity, sincerity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness under the policy of forging friendships and partnerships. China will work to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries, guided by the principle of upholding justice and pursuing shared interests with the principle of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith. We will strengthen exchanges and cooperation with political parties and organisations in other countries, and encourage people’s congresses, the military, local governments, and people’s organisations to pursue exchanges with other countries.‘Pauk-phaw’ friendshipThis philosophy is of great significance to China’s future friendly exchanges and cooperation with Myanmar. With a common border of over 2200 kilometres, China and Myanmar enjoy a long-lasting pauk-phaw  (a term coined in the 1950s to describe the friendly and close relationship between China and Myanmar that may be translated as “fraternal”) friendship. We are friendly neighbours that share weal and woe, and a shared destiny. Myanmar and its people aspire to achieve national reconciliation and everlasting peace, promote development and improve people’s lives, for which China stands ready to offer help. We also hope that Myanmar’s political parties can unite and cooperate hand-in-hand to build and develop Myanmar. The report highlights the Belt and Road Initiative as an important component of China’s economic development and diplomacy, which is an important opportunity for Myanmar to join in the cooperation and realise its vision of national development. In May 2017, Beijing and Nay Pyi Taw signed a memorandum of understanding on pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative, which was witnessed by the leaders of the two countries. The BRI – which is strongly supported by the Myanmar government, the tatmadaw, political parties and people from all walks of life – is the main platform for Chinese-Myanmar cooperation. Pushing forward the BRI in Myanmar is to jointly build the road to peace, development and the people’s welfare.          The road to peaceFirst and foremost, the BRI is a road for peace. The report proposes that China and Myanmar “should commit to settling disputes through dialogue and resolving differences through discussion,” in which the former would play a constructive role in promoting national peace and reconciliation in the latter. The Chinese government has appointed a special envoy for Asian affairs who has been making efforts to encourage dialogue for peace among the relevant parties. The China-Myanmar 2+2 High-level Consultations mechanism between foreign ministries and defence ministries has been established to jointly safeguard and promote peace and stability in the two countries’ border areas. With the help of China, seven armed ethnic organisations in northern Myanmar attended the second session of the 21st Century Panglong Peace Conference in May 2017 and a delegation of the Myanmar Peace Commission recently visited the Wa and special region 4 of Shan State. China wants the third session 21st Century Panglong Peace Conference to be a success, and supports the adherence by the relevant parties to the “Panglong spirit” of conducting friendly negotiations to reach a political consensus featuring national unity and a high degree of autonomy under a constitutional framework. In this way, Myanmar can achieve a sustainable peace and lasting stability at an early date.The road to developmentThe report proposes that “we stick together through thick and thin, promote trade and investment liberalisation, and make economic globalisation more open, inclusive, and balanced so that its benefits are shared by all.” As Myanmar’s biggest trading partner and foreign investor and in accordance with Myanmar’s national development plan and needs, China is willing to discuss construction of a China-Myanmar economic corridor from Yunnan in the north to Mandalay in the south and extending east and west to the Yangon new city and Kyaukphyu special economic zone (SEZ). China would also like to work with Myanmar to ensure the smooth operation of the China-Myanmar oil and gas pipeline, launch the Kyaukphyu SEZ project at an early date, establish a China-Myanmar border economic cooperation zone, enhance the connectivity of roads and railways and electricity infrastructure, undertake comprehensive management of the Irrawaddy River, and construct Yangon new city. All these projects will give new impetus to the development and prosperity of Myanmar.The roads for peace and development complement each other. The experience of China’s development shows that peace is a precondition for development and development is the way to achieve peace. This has been applied by China to help Myanmar to address the issue of Rakhine State. China has taken a just and objective position on the issue, supporting Myanmar in its endeavour to safeguard peace and stability in Rakhine. China’s foreign minister visited Bangladesh and Myanmar recently and proposed a three-phase solution to address the conflict in Rakhine State. The first phase envisions a ceasefire, cessation of  violence and resumption of social stability so that people can live in peace without being homeless. The second phase calls for all parties and the international community to encourage Myanmar and Bangladesh to keep in touch and strengthen communication in an effort to find feasible approaches to resolve this issue through friendly consultation on an equal footing as soon as possible. China appreciates the agreement on repatriation that has been signed by Myanmar and Bangladesh and hopes this arrangement can be implemented as soon as possible. In the third phase, priority should be given to strategies to address the root cause of the problem.China thinks that poverty is the cause of the conflicts and calls for support and investment in the state to promote development, alleviate poverty and achieve stability. China is willing to make contributions to this end and thinks its three-phase solution will bring ethnic harmony, social stability and economic development to Rakhine.The welfare of the peopleThe report stresses that China will uphold justice while pursuing shared interests to enhance cooperation with developing countries. China has launched a series of livelihood-promotion projects in Myanmar to bring more benefits to the Myanmar people. In 2015, China was the first to lend a helping hand to Myanmar when it was hit by the worst flooding in 50 years. What it has done proves that though nature is merciless, there is always love and help from pauk-phaw (brothers). Last year, China provided humanitarian aid to Myanmar when the country was hit by the H1N1 flu epidemic. China also dispatched Brightness Journey medical teams to Myanmar to undertake free cataract surgery for 6000 people in the past two years. It has built nearly 20 China-Myanmar friendship schools around the country, and China-Myanmar friendship scholarships have been awarded to thousands of Myanmar students. It has provided more than 2000 training opportunities for Myanmar each year to support the country’s training efforts.   The report by General Secretary Xi Jinping to the congress reaffirmed that the aspirations of people to live better lives must always be the focus of China’s efforts. Likewise, the aspirations of the people of China and Myanmar to live better lives must be the focus of cooperation between the two counties. I believe that under the guidance of this common goal, Myanmar’s road to peace, development and people’s welfare will be even broader and smoother and China-Myanmar relations will steadily move toward a brighter future. Hong Liang is China’s ambassador to Myanmar.","/news/china-congress-augurs-well-myanmar.html"
"38",38,"Government looks to LNG imports to produce more electricity",2018-02-07,"Business","For the first time, Myanmar will import liquefied natural gas (LNG) as it races to meet an expected shortage of electricity. By 2020, the country will require double its current electricity supply to meet rising demand from households and businesses.                         The Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MOEE) on January 30 issued a Notice to Proceed to four power projects, three of which will receive imported LNG for re-gasification. The projects will be carried out in Kan Pauk in Tanintharyi Region, Mee Laung Gaing in Ayeyarwady Region, and Ahlone in Yangon Region.          “The LNG will be delivered by LNG carriers for re-gasification and power generation at the plants. The plants have been allowed to commence doing so,” said U Soe Myint, deputy permanent secretary of the MOEE.The fourth project, which involves natural gas, will be carried out in Kyaukphyu, Rakhine State. The projects are expected to help generate around 3,000 megawatts (MW) of power, double the country’s current supply, to meet the MOEE’s 6,000MW electricity target by 2020-21.Power generationThe first phase of LNG-generated electricity will come from two plants at Kan Pauk and Mee Laung Gaing. Those plants will have the capacity to contribute 1,230MW and 1,390Mof electricity, respectively, to the national grid. French oil company Total, together with Germany’s Siemens, will carry out the project in Kan Pauk, delivering 615MW of electricity within the first three years. The MOEE did not announce the investment value of the Kan Pauk project. Total operates the Yadana offshore gas field, Myanmar’s biggest offshore oil and gas project, and owns existing pipelines and natural gas distribution stations in Kan Pauk.Meanwhile, China’s Zheful Holding Group, together with local company Supreme Group, will implement the $2.5 billion Mee Laung Gaing plant. The first phase will be ready in three years. The Chinese plan to build a floating storage re-gasification unit (FSRU) where gas tankers will be able to deliver LNG for the plant, according to Frontier.Supreme Group is the local partner of US-based APR Energy, which is operating an existing 102MW gas plant in Kyaukse, Mandalay.Thailand’s TTLC will install 356MW of capacity at the $321 million Ahlone plant, while China’s Sinohydro and Supreme Group will install 135MW of capacity at the $180 million gas-fueled plant in Kyaukphyu, according to the MOEE. The two plants will start contributing to the grid within two years. Power Purchase AgreementsFollowing signing of the Letter to Proceed, the next step will be negotiating the terms for the Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) under which the government will buy the electricity. “We will need to carry out thorough negotiations on the PPAs as well as land lease contracts and make sure all other licenses and permits are in place,” said U Win Khaing, Union Minister for Electricity and Energy. “We have to discuss issues such as selling price of the electricity and who bears the related costs,” said U Soe Myint.U Kyaw Kyaw Hlaing, chair of Myanmar Oil and Gas Services Society, warned that “generating electricity is already expensive for the government, which bears most of the costs involved in power generation, even when using normal gas. It will be even more expensive if LNG is used,” he said. Myanmar currently generates a total of 3,189MW of electricity. This is generated by a 17 hydropower plants and 15 natural gas plants across the country. With electricity consumption on the rise, Myanmar will need about 6,000MW of electricity by 2020-21, the MOEE said.","/news/government-looks-lng-imports-produce-more-electricity.html"
"39",39,"Regional economy supported by India’s accelerated growth: PwC",2018-02-02,"Business","Myanmar is set to represent one of the fast growing economies this year but it will be affected by India’s growth acceleration as well as the stability of the Chinese economy, according to PwC Growth Markets Centre.                         David Wijeratne, Gagan Oberoi and Neu Boon Ling from the centre said that 2018 has so far given boost to a general feeling of optimism about the world economy with both developed and emerging economies contributing to global economic growth. This development is fueled by the benefits of structural reforms in key emerging markets such as Mexico and India, strengthening commodity prices, growing and stable demand from developed markets, in particular the Europe Union and Japan, and Chinese fiscal stimulus.          At the same time, the centre conceded that this growth will be tempered by interest rate hikes in developed markets, led by the US, and inflationary pressures and political elections in certain emerging economies. Protectionism and trade tensions, particularly between the US and China, and geopolitical tensions with North Korea, Iran and Qatar, will further affect economic growth.In parallel to this is the issue of productivity, which is a core area of improvement for all emerging economies. Nonetheless, it looks like the collective GDP for emerging markets is poised to rise modestly by 4.9pc, thereby stimulating investor interest. PwC Growth Markets Centre has summarised the analysis on major regions in the Asia Pacific below: IndiaIndia’s growth looks set to accelerate, as the negative impacts from demonetisation and the implementation of the new “Goods and Services Tax” start to dissipate. Supplementing these two major reforms, there have been a series of initiatives adopted to ease doing business and facilitate foreign direct investment from big investors such as Japan and South Korea. Next on the Modi agenda will be to gain a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the second legislature, following the April elections, which will facilitate his push for more controversial, but much-needed reforms such as land acquisition.ChinaFollowing Chinese President Xi Jinping’s consolidation of power, at last year’s 19th Party Congress, China will continue its globalisation agenda, the pace of which will depend on how it addresses the concerns from neighbouring regions.Globalisation will be balanced against domestic needs, specifically managing provincial debt, cooling the housing market, addressing industrial surplus and containing inflation. On balance, these measures look to support real GDP growth of 6 .5pc in 2018. The country will no doubt pursue these priorities with one eye on any US policies aimed at reducing its trade deficit with China.Southeast AsiaThe Southeast Asian region looks to maintain its strong economic growth story in 2018, benefiting from an international trade boom, while preparing itself for any effects from interest rate hikes in key investor markets such as the US and a series of elections in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Generally, the basis of this growth looks to broaden beyond manufacturing and electronics, providing opportunities for investment from other sectors. Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, will continue to represent the fastest growing economies, registering strong 6-8pc GDP growth, thanks mainly to increasing consumer demand, rising inward investment and growing intra-regional trade, while policy reforms and rising public infrastructure spending will drive growth in the larger economies of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Many of these markets have strengthened their position by building foreign exchange reserves to protect themselves against capital flow volatility.","/news/regional-economy-supported-indias-accelerated-growth-pwc.html"
"40",40,"Experts divided over ramifications of Belt and Road courts on Myanmar",2018-02-02,"Business","“This is bad news for Myanmar. It will undermine Myanmar’s sovereignty and empower multinational corporations,” said Dr Charlie Thame from Thammasat University.                         CRITICS questioned Beijing’s decision to set up three commercial courts in China to resolve Belt and Road-related project disputes, arguing that legal disagreements involving transnational investors should be settled in host states or third-party territories. An academic further lambasted such arrangements as “essentially tools for corporations to restrict access to justice” which will erode community rights, Nay Pyi Taw’s right to regulate as well as Myanmar’s sovereignty.           However, other lawyers welcomed the development and were confident that the new courts would be “neutral and fair” and would facilitate BRI expertise, saying that the mechanism is “ultimately a matter of convenience.”New Belt and Road courts in China The Chinese embassy in Yangon confirmed to The Myanmar Times on Wednesday that Beijing will set up a new Belt and Road dispute settlement mechanism, but did not comment further on the location or structure of the new courts.Chinese news media reported that the new BRI dispute settlement mechanism will be comprised of three international commercial courts set up by China’s Supreme People’s Court in Xi’an, Shenzhen and Beijing, with the headquarters in the capital. The court in Xi’an will cover commercial disputes along the Silk Road Economic Belt, a land-based route which runs from western China to Europe and the Middle East through Central Asia, while the Shenzhen court will oversee cases arising along the 21st Maritime Silk Road, a sea route which links the Chinese coast to Europe and Africa via Southeast Asia and other waters. The courts would resemble Singapore’s International Commercial Court and Dubai’s International Finance Centre Courts. It was also reported that Beijing’s top legal body is eager to promote mediation to resolve BRI disputes. BRI projects in Myanmar are ruled, in principle, by existing bilateral or multilateral treaties, according to HRMR lead director Eric Rose. In Myanmar's case, the projects are ruled by the 2012 “Agreement on Dispute Settlement Mechanism of the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Cooperation” between ASEAN and China, and the 2002 Sino-Myanmar bilateral investment treaty. Both treaties provide for similar conflict resolution: consultation, followed by mediation, followed by arbitration by an ad-hoc arbitration tribunal, with no preset venue or choice of law, either procedural or substantive.In Myanmar, Kyaukphyu is the foremost BRI project but businesses expect more investment projects, especially infrastructure investments, to come in. Hence, this development has huge implications on those businesses who seek to attract Chinese investments. Existing alternativesMr Rose said that there are already existing alternatives than accepting arbitration in China. In September last year, the Singapore International Mediation Centre and the China Chamber of International Commerce Mediation Centre (CCOIC) entered into an MoU to resolve BRI cross-border disputes. Meanwhile, Dr Shahla Ali, deputy director of Hong Kong University’s arbitration and dispute resolution programme, further confirmed to The Myanmar Times that Hong Kong’s justice department has been developing eBRAM.hk, an online dispute resolution tool for major BRI infrastructure projects.Given the alternatives, Mr Rose argued, “it really appears that the Chinese government is trying to force the other sides to accept Chinese mediation and arbitration through its proposal to have these three courts rule on all BRI disputes.”“The BRI recipients, however, always have the option of saying ‘NO!’” he commented. China’s top legal body has been in the process of “internationalising” its domestic court system and the three new courts are supposed to be modelled after the established ones in Singapore or Dubai. But Mr Rose remained unconvinced.  “Despite these steps, given the ‘novelty’ of these concepts to most Chinese jurists, the imposition of a requirement for BRI projects to be settled in the three Chinese courts smacks of … ‘Chinese Arrogance Concept’. The choice of arbitration venue and law, both procedural and substantive, should be left to the negotiation between the parties,” he said, adding that third party jurisdictions with established rules and an experienced body of jurists are “always preferable to those jurisdictions affiliated with one or the other of the parties to a contract”.On the contrary, Bob Tseng and Mariano Suarez, partners of Thanlwin Legal, noted that traditional arbitration centres such as Singapore, London and Hong Kong are for highly sophisticated businesses. While these remain worthy options, Belt and Road countries should be “pleased that China is developing these international commercial courts which has expertise in Belt and Road projects and great understanding of Belt and Road participating countries.”The BRI recipients, however, always have the option of saying ‘NO!’”- Eric Rose, HRMR“Bad news for Myanmar”Not everyone shares that optimism.For Dr Charlie Thame, lecturer in International Relations at Bangkok’s Thammasat University, having mainland China courts to settle disputes is “bad news for Myanmar” and will undercut sovereignty, community rights, access to justice and, ultimately, democracy. “This is bad news for Myanmar. It will undermine Myanmar’s sovereignty and empower multinational corporations. Transnational investors have sued states for billions of dollars under similar mechanisms for taking measures to protect public health or the environment, review exploitative contracts acquired through allegations of corruption, promote industrialisation, or even adjust corporate taxes. This has a chilling effect, undermining democratic decision making and restricting states’ right to regulate in the public interest and protect the rights of their people, environment, and resources,” he replied in an email.Dr Thame argued it is unlikely Myanmar would have been able to review Myitsone Dam or Kyaukphyu SEZ if such provisions were in place.“These mechanisms are essentially tools for corporations to restrict access to justice. The OECD estimates that expenses for a single Investor-State Dispute Settlement case amounts to $8 million. Even if a state wins, they must pay half of this, so litigation is prohibitively expensive for countries like Myanmar. “Moreover, it’s unlikely there will be provisions for communities facing negative impacts of these investments: human rights violations, environmental degradation, or loss of livelihoods. Even in internationally reputable permanent arbitration institutions, arbitrators usually interpret investors’ rights broadly, and conflicts of interests are common, since arbitrators sometimes also work as counsels for investors. Many BRI companies are Chinese, and often state-owned enterprises, raising further questions about independence and impartiality of the proposed courts,” he explained.The academic stressed that governments have a right to regulate and that legal disputes involving transnational investors should be resolved in host states, so governments can protect the interests of their citizens. This is bad news for Myanmar. It will undermine Myanmar’s sovereignty and empower multinational corporations.- Charlie Thame, Thammasat University“Reasonable and expected”But other experts are more positive, seeing that as a natural consequence of China’s rising bargaining power.Mr Tseng and Mr Suarez defended the new development as “reasonable and expected”, especially when both parties are Chinese corporate entities.“International dispute resolution is ultimately a matter of convenience. “China is, in most situations, the ‘investor’ across the many projects within the Belt and Road Initiative. It makes sense that China would enjoy the bargaining power to have any disputes settled within China,” they commented. It makes sense that China would enjoy the bargaining power to have any disputes settled within China.- Bob Tseng and Mariano Suarez, Thanlwin LegalMyanmar courts retain legal authorityWilliam Greenlee from DFDL, who's chair of American Chamber of Commerce Myanmar's legal committee, said that courts in Myanmar will retain the legal authority to review whether an award is in line with the local law even when the arbitration is done outside the country.“It is true that some local investors and relevant project target governments, in this case Myanmar government, may prefer to have the relevant seat of arbitration in a third country. However, China is experienced in international investing and I assume arbitration in China would be neutral and fair.“Either way, any resulting arbitration award would have to be enforced by the relevant local government’s courts and such courts generally do have legal authority to review the award and underlying case and determine if fair and/ or complies with local laws,” he said.He added that it is up to the relevant parties in Myanmar to decide whether to sign up for individual BRI projects and the related arbitration arrangements. “Some particular [Belt and Road-driven] investments will likely be accepted by the relevant international government and some will not. A condition of any potential arbitration in China is one of many terms that the parties will look at and determine if acceptable or not,” he said.The Myanmar Times has contacted CITIC, which is leading the consortium for Kyaukphyu SEZ, for comment.","/news/experts-divided-over-ramifications-belt-and-road-courts-myanmar.html"
"41",41,"Davos 2018: China’s economic shift and implications for Myanmar",2018-02-01,"Asean Focus, Business","Myanmar will capture Chinese investment as Beijing prioritises poverty alleviation and development in Yunnan                         AS the fight against poverty takes centre stage in Beijing’s economic policy, Yunnan and Myanmar will remain a priority for Chinese investment, while China's fast-growing middle-income population, especially those in the southwest, presents a crucial market for Myanmar's growth-oriented businesses as well as its export strategy.          The annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, where deputy finance minister U Set Aung took part in a panel discussion, has ended. Apart from the tech and social media challenge, another issue highly relevant to Myanmar is China’s economic transition.Among the most anticipated speeches was the one delivered by Liu He, key adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping, outlining Beijing’s economic policy over the next few years.Who is Liu He? What is his key message?As President Xi’s right-hand man, Mr Liu is China's representative to Davos this year. The Harvard-educated technocrat, a member of China's top political body since last year, is widely seen as being on track to become Mr Xi's key lieutenant on the country’s economy and financial system. This makes his speech about the economic priorities and how the regime plans to shape the world economy particularly significant for the global audience. His message is a continuation from last year, when Xi Jinping caused a stir by espousing globalisation in the era of Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda.Mr Liu said that China’s economic policy centers around “a key necessity, a main task, and three critical battles”.Firstly, the necessity is to transition the national economy from quantity growth to quality growth.Secondly, the main task is to raise the game of supply-side structural reform to keep pace with the evolving demand.Thirdly, the three key battles are preventing major financial risks, tackling poverty and reducing pollution.Fourthly, China has endeavoured to liberalise its financial markets over the past year, and to facilitate globalisation through its Belt and Road Initiative.“Is it good enough?”China’s economy has been transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to one of high-quality development, according to Mr Liu, and it is in this broader context that the country shapes its macroeconomic and structural reforms to complement economic development.“China’s per capita income is moving up from the current level of US$8,000-plus to $10,000 and even higher. At such a stage of development, China needs to put more emphasis on structural improvement rather than quantity expansion,” he noted. Hence, China’s focus needs to change from “Is there enough?” to “Is it good enough?”.  This transition and the accompanying liberalisation will create huge opportunities for new industries, such as higher-quality manufacturing and service industries, energy-efficient buildings, smart transport technology and low-carbon industries. This will result in a knock-on effect on other industries as the national economy modernises.After decades of development, a large middle-income population has emerged in China, the biggest in the world, giving rise to a vast domestic market. This open market with a fast-growing middle-income population of 400 million will contribute significantly to global development.- Liu He, Xi Jinping’s top economic aideUpgrading supply reformsThe key contradiction in China’s economic growth is that the supply side fails to catch up with the demand, according to the Harvard-educated technocrat, resulting in “a structural mismatch that urgently needs to be fixed”. The focus, again, is turning to quality improvement.“The priority at the moment is to cut excess capacity where necessary, reduce inventory in the housing sector, bring down the overall leverage ratio, lower cost across the board, and strengthen the weak links in the economy ranging from public services to infrastructure and institutions. With these measures, we hope to make the supply side more adaptable and more innovative,” he explained.Financial risks and pollutionFinancial risks, poverty and pollution are three prioritised targetted by Beijing.The government plans to prevent and resolve major risks in China’s economy, including the risks posed by shadow banking and hidden debt for local governments. Mr Liu noted that huge potential remains to be capitalised in urbanisation, innovation and overhaul of traditional industries, while the financial system is benefitted by a high savings rate. Additionally, since the fourth quarter of 2017, the country has had a marginally slower overall leverage ratio growth, which is a positive sign.Additionally, China will raise its game in the battle against pollution by prioritising green and low-carbon development. The economist said that Beijing in the next three years will intensify pollution control to substantially cut the total emissions of major pollutants and lower the intensity of resource consumption.This echoes the commitment from French President Emmanuel Macron, who promised that France will shut down all coal-fired power stations by 2021. Mr Macron wanted to “make France a model in the fight against climate change,” as one of five pillars in his plans to reform the economy.“That is a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness. Talent will come where it is good to live. We can create a lot of jobs with such a strategy,” he said.The French president also said that the Belt and Road Initiative, in which Myanmar is a core player, needs to be environmentally friendly. “The new Silk Road has to be a green road. We cannot have a coal-based route,” Mr Macron remarked, conceding that the world is losing the battle on climate change.Fight against povertyHowever, the economic shift with the most immediate impact on Myanmar is China’s battle against poverty.Liu He argued that in the last five years, the number of rural residents living in poverty dropped from nearly 100 million to around 30 million.“We have set a target to basically eliminate absolute poverty in three years, which means no single rural resident will be living below the current poverty line. This year alone, China will lift 10 million people from absolute poverty, including 2.8 million who will be relocated from areas suffering from harsh conditions.”These poverty alleviation efforts have a major impact on the distribution of national income, which, in turn, will affect Myanmar in two ways.Yunnan tops the agendaChina’s fight against poverty will shift its developmental focus to poorer regions, including Yunnan, one of the least developed Chinese provinces, which shares a long border with Shan State and dominates Myanmar's border trade.Jonathan Woetzel, senior partner of McKinsey & Company and director of the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), told The Myanmar Times that Chinese investment will continue to look to Myanmar in an effort to develop the region’s population.“China sees the development of the southwestern part as strategic to its fight against poverty. Myanmar and the broader Southeast Asian region will continue to be a priority for Chinese investment to support economic development. However, reducing financial risks and ensuring macro stability must always come first for Chinese policy-makers so there may be some volatility in the pace of overseas investment. The war against pollution will also translate into a renewed emphasis on green growth both in China and in its investments abroad,” he stated.Meanwhile, Myanmar has to intensify its efforts to develop the economy, otherwise the already-glaring economic asymmetry will worsen further. Right now, Yunnan’s economy is already four times bigger than Myanmar’s national economy. If the province jumps ahead, the imbalance could have wide-ranging implications in the region.China sees the development of the southwestern part as strategic to its fight against poverty. Myanmar... will continue to be a priority for Chinese investment to support economic development.- Jonathan Woetzel, McKinsey & CompanyAn enormous market for MyanmarLiu He’s Davos message is a crucial and timely reminder for Myanmar’s domestic businesses that China is as much about the market as it is about the investment.Much of the discussion taking place in Myanmar, concerning the Belt and Road Initiative as well as China, is about Chinese investments flowing into the country, filling the infrastructure gap, financing roads and bankrolling ports. The development of the proposed deep-sea port in Kyaukphyu, Rakhine, for example, is led by China’s state-owned bank CITIC and a consortium of mainly Chinese conglomerates.But the Chinese market is equally important for Myanmar’s businesses, many of whom seek to grow and scale up after the country has suffered from decades of isolation.“After decades of development, a large middle-income population has emerged in China, the biggest in the world, giving rise to a vast domestic market.“This open market with a fast-growing middle-income population of 400 million will contribute significantly to global development,” Mr Liu said, bringing home to the audience the scale of the market demand.At the same time, as southwestern China receives more support to develop, the regional population will be an increasingly important market for Myanmar, bolstered by the geographical proximity. This will be a crucial market into which Nay Pyi Taw taps, as the National League of Democracy-led government throws their weight behind export prioritisation.The good news for China’s neighbours is that investment will continue while the market will grow.Mr Woetzel does not anticipate any slowdown in Chinese overseas investment.“China’s overseas investment pace reflects its growing economy and the capacity of its companies to globalise. We do not see any slowdown at this point, though some volatility is normal along the way. Chinese corporations are motivated to globalise largely by economic grounds. Our most recent research indicates that over 80pc of Chinese enterprises in Africa are private. As long as growth prospects in Belt and Road countries are attractive, Chinese companies will continue to invest,” he analysed.Scott Kennedy, director of the project on Chinese business and political economy at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, told the South China Morning Post that Liu He's ""safe"" speech, in conrast with President Xi's ""bold speech"" last year, ""entirely avoided the deep tensions between China’s rhetoric in support of free trade and globalisation, and its highly interventionist industrial policy system and policies that he has played a central part in managing over the past five years.” Globalism with Chinese characteristics, according to the CSIS director, is in fact a illiberal system which encourages trade and investment coupled with deep government intervention to serve industrial policy goals, ensure domestic stability and greater international influence.Mats Harborn, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said the speech was void of commitment. “There is a frustrating gap between promises and action. A clear implementation timeline is now required,” the Post quoted him saying.","/news/davos-2018-chinas-economic-shift-and-implications-myanmar.html"
"42",42,"ASEAN has busy election calendar",2018-01-17,"Opinion","What should we expect for ASEAN in 2018? On the economic front, the overall picture remains unclear even though export growth is likely to continue on the back of improving global demand. But what is certain is that domestic politics will ultimately dominate the headlines.                         The election timeline for ASEAN is busy over the coming two years, starting with Cambodia in July, following a senate election late next month. Long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen has effectively neutered the opposition with the arrest of Kem Sokha, leader of the Cambodian National Rescue Party, on dubious treason charges and the subsequent dissolution of the CNRP by a compliant Supreme Court. This has raised fears that Cambodia is becoming openly authoritarian.          Certainly, Cambodia’s democracy has never been fully free and open. Some say the unprecedented crackdown was a response to voter surveys showing the ruling Cambodian People’s Party was on course to lose to the CNRP. The Cambodian strongman, meanwhile, enjoys enthusiastic support from China as their relationship blossoms at the expense of ties with the US and the European Union.US Senator Ted Cruz in October accused Hun Sen of “endangering the future not only of US-Cambodia relations, but of Cambodian democracy”. The EU cancelled US$8 million (K10.8 billion) in funding for Cambodia’s election, but the amount pales beside the hundreds of millions in aid lavished on the country by Beijing. That’s in addition to direct investment worth a cumulative $11.2 billion as of 2016.In Malaysia, elections must be held by August. Opinion polls suggest the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition may have lost some support but BN chairman Najib Razak, who has been prime minister since April 2009, will likely face a splintered opposition and should nonetheless secure a majority of seats.Despite an international investigation into the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal, involving hundreds of millions of dollars alleged to have been laundered for personal gain, Mr Najib will benefit from the formidable vote-getting and patronage machine of his United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). The presence of former premier Mahathir Mohamad as the opposition standard-bearer may not be enough to break UMNO’s grip. He is 92, after all.In Thailand, the first election in seven years is expected to be held in November, barring any more surprises from the military. If and when the poll is held, many businesses may resume long-postponed investments, boosting what has consistently been one of the economy’s weakest points.Meanwhile, over 130 million voters across 17 provinces in Indonesia will take part in regional elections in June, seen as a proxy for the presidential poll in April next year. The latter is expected to pit incumbent President Joko Widodo against former general Prabowo – the same match-up as in 2014. Investors worry about possible risks to policy continuity as Widodo’s rival has criticised his economic policies, such as welcoming Chinese investments.Businesses may also be deferring investments in Indonesia due to uncertainty about tax liabilities, and while the official tax amnesty has ended, the government continues to offer incentives for businesses and individuals to declare assets and settle tax bills. But a notable acceleration in consumption is expected to lift overall growth to 5.2 percent from 5.1pc last year.Looking forward to 2019, a mid-term election in May will be the first electoral test for President Rodrigo Duterte, who came to power in June 2016. The stakes are high as half of the senators are up for election. While the firebrand president has made progress on some reforms, a lot remains to be done before the mid-terms, particularly liberalising foreign direct investment (FDI). The Philippines trails most ASEAN economies in terms of FDI, but pushing through business-friendly reforms will “require significant political capital”, HSBC analysts wrote recently.Don’t forget Myanmar, where domestic politics are no less controversial. Despite economic development from a very low base, Myanmar has become a single-issue country revolving around the persecution of the Rohingya Muslim minority in northern Rakhine State. With domestic politics in a mess, the Daw Aung San Suu Kyi-led civilian government seems to be too busy to push key economic policies forward although some administrative reforms are on the cards.Politics could be the card that trumps all others in 2018. Investors should take note, as short-term gains from elections tend to give a boost to the economy. For example, election-related spending should be a driver of bread-and-butter spending for Malaysia, and possibly Thailand too. In the long term, political stability is important for us all. – Bangkok PostNareerat Wiriyapong is acting Asia Focus editor at the Bangkok Post.","/news/asean-has-busy-election-calendar.html"
"43",43,"China’s modern Silk Road hits political, financial hurdles",2018-01-12,"Opinion","China's plan for a modern Silk Road of railways, ports and other facilities linking Asia with Europe hit a $14 billion pothole in Pakistan.                         Pakistan’s relations with Beijing are so close that officials call China their “Iron Brother.” Despite that, plans for the Diamer-Bhasha Dam were thrown into turmoil in November when the chairman of Pakistan’s water authority said Beijing wanted an ownership stake in the hydropower project. He rejected that as against Pakistani interests.          China issued a denial but the official withdrew the dam from among dozens of projects being jointly developed by the two countries.From Pakistan to Tanzania to Hungary, projects under President Xi Jinping’s signature “Belt and Road Initiative” are being canceled, renegotiated or delayed due to disputes about costs or complaints host countries get too little out of projects built by Chinese companies and financed by loans from Beijing that must be repaid.In some places, Beijing is suffering a political backlash due to fears of domination by Asia’s biggest economy.“Pakistan is one of the countries that is in China’s hip pocket, and for Pakistan to stand up and say, ‘I’m not going to do this with you,’ shows it’s not as ‘win-win’ as China says it is,” said Robert Koepp, an analyst in Hong Kong for the Economist Corporate Network, a research firm.“Belt and Road,” announced by Xi in 2013, is a loosely defined umbrella for Chinese-built or -financed projects across 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe. They range from oil drilling in Siberia to construction of ports in Southeast Asia, railways in Eastern Europe and power plants in the Middle East.Other governments welcomed the initiative in a region the Asian Development Bank says needs more than $26 trillion of infrastructure investment by 2030 to keep economies growing. Nations including Japan have given or lent billions of dollars for development, but China’s venture is bigger and the only source of money for many projects.Governments from Washington to Moscow to New Delhi are uneasy Beijing is trying to use its “Belt and Road” to develop a China-centered political structure that will erode their influence.China’s significance to Pakistan as a source of financing increased following US President Donald Trump’s Jan. 5 decision to suspend security assistance to Islamabad in a dispute over whether it was doing enough to stop Afghan militants.“Belt and Road” is a business venture, not aid. A Cabinet official, Ou Xiaoli, told The Associated Press in April that lending will be on commercial terms. Beijing wants to attract non-Chinese investors, though that has happened with only a handful of projects, he said.Among projects that have been derailed or disrupted:— Authorities in Nepal canceled plans in November for Chinese companies to build a $2.5 billion dam after they concluded contracts for the Budhi Gandaki Hydro Electric Project violated rules requiring multiple bidders.— The European Union is looking into whether Hungary violated the trade bloc’s rules by awarding contracts to Chinese builders of a high-speed railway to neighboring Serbia without competing bids.— In Myanmar, plans for a Chinese oil company to build a $3 billion refinery were canceled in November due to financing difficulties, the newspaper Myanmar Times reported.There is no official list of projects, but consulting firm BMI Research has compiled a database of $1.8 trillion of infrastructure investments announced across Asia, Africa and the Middle East that include Chinese money or other involvement.Many are still in planning stages and some up to three decades in the future, according to Christian Zhang, a BMI analyst.“It’s probably too early to say at this point how much of the overall initiative will actually be implemented,” said Zhang.The US and Japanese governments express interest in building contracts or other potential “Belt and Road” opportunities for their companies. But they also are trying to develop alternative initiatives.In November, the US government’s Overseas Private Investment Corp. signed an agreement with Japanese partners to offer “infrastructure investment alternatives in the Indo-Pacific region,” according to a White House statement.The following month, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan can “cooperate greatly” with China.The stumbles for one of the world’s most ambitious infrastructure ventures could help temper concerns Beijing will increase its strategic influence.“There is a big possibility that China is going to have a lot of disagreements and misunderstandings,” said Kerry Brown, a specialist in Chinese politics at King’s College London. “It’s hard to think of a big, successful project the ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ has led to at the moment.”Even Pakistan, one of China’s friendliest neighbors, has failed to agree on key projects.The two governments are developing facilities with a total cost of $60 billion including power plants and railways to link China’s far west with the Chinese-built port of Gwadar on the Indian Ocean.A visit by a Chinese assistant foreign minister in November produced no agreement on railway projects in the southern city of Karachi valued at $10 billion and a $260 million airport for Gwadar.The same month, the chairman of the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority announced the Diamer-Bhasha Dam would be withdrawn from joint development. The site is in Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan’s far north, part of the Kashmir region, which also is claimed by India.“Chinese conditions for financing the Diamer-Bhasha Dam were not doable and against our interests,” the official, Muzammil Hussain, told legislators, according to Pakistani news reports.The Chinese Cabinet agency overseeing “Belt and Road,” the National Development and Reform Commission, denied in a written statement that it asked for an ownership stake. It said the two sides had held only preliminary talks about the project.A Pakistani Cabinet official who spoke on condition he not be identified further said the Chinese side asked for clarification of the ownership status of the dam site because Gilgit-Baltistan has yet to be formally made part of a Pakistani province. The water authority didn’t respond to requests to clarify its chairman’s comments.“Belt and Road” is interwoven with official efforts to export Chinese rail, hydropower and other technology and steel, aluminum and other industrial goods.In Thailand, work on a $15 billion high-speed railway was suspended in 2016 following complaints too little business went to Thai companies.After more talks over costs, technology sharing and land ownership, Thai leaders announced a new plan in July for a first line to be built from Bangkok to the country’s northeast. Building contracts went to Thai companies while China will supply technology.In Tanzania, the government has reopened negotiations with China and another investor, the government of the gulf nation of Oman, over ownership of a planned $11 billion port in the city of Bagamoyo. The Tanzanian government failed to raise $28 million for its contribution, leaving it unclear what share the government might get.Tanzania wants to make sure its people get more than just taxes collected from the port, said the director of the Tanzania Ports Authority, Deusdedit Kakoko.“Land is for Tanzanians, and as the government we’re ensuring they get a share,” Kakoko said in an interview.Despite such setbacks, Chinese officials say most “Belt and Road” projects are moving ahead with few problems.Work on pipelines to deliver oil and gas from Russia and Central Asia is making “steady progress,” said a deputy commerce minister, Li Chenggang, at a November 21 news conference.“We have a lot of room for further cooperation,” said Li.The state-run China Development Bank announced in 2015 it had set aside $890 billion for more than 900 projects across 60 countries in gas, minerals, power, telecoms, infrastructure and farming. The Export-Import Bank of China said it would finance 1,000 projects in 49 countries.Acting as banker gives Beijing leverage to require use of Chinese builders and technology. But it can lead to complaints host countries fail to negotiate hard enough.In Sri Lanka, the government sold an 80 percent stake in a port in the southern city of Hambantota to a Chinese state-owned company on Dec. 9 after falling behind in repaying $1.5 billion borrowed from Beijing to build it. That prompted complaints the deal was too favorable to Beijing.“There is the perception of a Chinese incursion into their sovereignty by taking over the port,” said BMI’s Zhang.","/news/chinas-modern-silk-road-hits-political-financial-hurdles.html"
"44",44,"Myanmar should focus on industrialisation, export strategy for better value",2018-01-11,"Business","Dr Vilem Semerak, researcher and lecturer at the Institute of Economic Studies of Charles University in the Czech Republic, reckons Myanmar should abandon its import substitution policies and start thinking ahead.  Import substitution advocates replacing foreign imports with domestic production.                         During his presentation on trade, industrialisation and growth in Myanmar for 2018 at the Mandalay University last Saturday, Dr Semerak, whose current research focuses on economic reforms and trade in Myanmar, suggested the country should instead aim for industrialisation and export growth for better value across the economy over the long term.          Dr Semerak’s views come after the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) on December 22 invited companies to submit proposals for investments in 13 import substitution industries, including auto and auto parts, tractors and trailers, telephone and telecom equipment, machines and machine parts, power distribution and installation, iron and steel construction materials, fertilisers, plastic raw materials, paper, chemicals, edible oil, medical products and beauty products.The move is aimed at lowering Myanmar’s widening trade deficit, which is currently over $3.1 billion, with imports amounting to $12.86 billion compared to exports of $0.75 billion, according to the Ministry of Commerce Ministry. “I would recommend that Myanmar focus more on industrialisation and perhaps forget about import substitution,” Dr Semerak told The Myanmar Times during an interview in Mandalay on Monday. Here are some excerpts from that interview, which have been edited for clarity. How will Myanmar benefit from abandoning import substitution?Import substitution can play a positive role in the economy but it has to lead to the industralisation of the country. Industrialisation can help Myanmar develop its export market and steer it towards leveraging on its comparative advantages in production rather than simply replacing import products. The Myanmar market is very fragmented so focusing on producing domestically for local consumption can be a waste of money if not well-managed. If there is a plan to transform short term import substitution policies into a longer term industrialisation strategy, it can also help to deter the Dutch Disease, which refers to the currency risks associated with the country’s high dependence on natural resource exports.  The Myanmar government should definitely also focus on improving the institutional, infrastructure and educational environment to help export-oriented sectors build competitive advantages for the future development of the economy. What measures should the government take to raise Myanmar’s attractiveness to other markets and help ease trade dependence on China? Myanmar has access to most other markets. It has, for instance, almost completely open access to EU markets within the European Banking Authority’s system of trade preferences. The government can therefore attempt to support export diversification by improving information services for exporters, but also by working with them on quality and assisting with complicated certification issues.  Support for deeper ASEAN integration as a regional counter-balance to China can be also useful.At the same time, it is very probable that this effort will have relatively small macroeconomic impact on Myanmar, especially in the short run. The economic logic of trade relations and the features of Chinese markets suggest that China will remain the dominant partner for Myanmar in the foreseeable future. Currently, China is the destination for about 41 percent of Myanmar’s merchandise exports          should-focus_2.jpg                Some have pointed out that the Myanmar economy is on a downward trend. To what extent is our poor economic performance undermined by the pace of political reform? The recent downward trend in the economy has led people to deduce that the problems stem from disappointing political and economic reforms. But when we look at the data for Myanmar, growth in the economy is actually forecast to accelerate in 2017. Recent forecasts by the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), Asia Development Bank (ADB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) show expected growth for Myanmar coming in as high as 7.7pc in 2017.This suggests that perhaps there are some discrepancies between the official data and the public’s perception of growth. From my perspective, the macroeconomic performance in Myanmar is definitely quite positive from my perspective. Actual political problems during the reforms are almost always much more complicated than anticipated at the beginning of the reforms.What is the best solution to remedy the economic setbacks and which sectors should the government focus on? Surveys among business people and comparisons with other economies suggest that Myanmar is facing multiple problems, including underdeveloped infrastructure, bureaucracy and lack of experience among entrepreneurs and a weak financial system and education system overall. As such, it is difficult to choose one particular sector or one particular type of reform which Myanmar must focus on. However, it is necessary to achieve gradual progress in many sectors simultaneously and it is vital to ensure that the reforms continue and that they are not hijacked by specific interest groups.At the general level it is important to preserve the motivation for reforms and sufficient flexibility of the domestic economy, for instance by means of emphasis on competition policy and sound banking which prevents large players from abusing their position.Also, to not forget about sectors which are often relatively silent and which often do not attract immediate attention, but which are likely to be crucial for the future economic growth and development such as education.How will the Rakhine crisis affect the economy in 2018? Available forecasts by the ADB and EIU state that Myanmar will continue growing in 2018. The real GDP rate of growth estimates range from 6.7pc from the EIU to 8pc from the ADB. Therefore if a peaceful and stable solution is found soon the overall effects on the whole economy can still remain relatively small. However, it will be different at the regional level; the directly afflicted regions may need additional assistance which can lead to additional pressures on public budgets.If an acceptable solution is not found fast, Myanmar’s reputation and attractiveness for investors may suffer and Myanmar can even face additional sanctions. This will result in fewer investments and deter funding for international projects in Myanmar.It will also pose a direct threat to reforms and especially for attempts to diversify the economy and its exports. That can also mean Myanmar is forced to focus even more on China because EU and US investors are discouraged by political effects of the crisis.","/news/myanmar-should-focus-industrialisation-export-strategy-better-value.html"
"45",45,"Myanmar better off in good graces with the West",2018-01-03,"National News","Two developments stood out in Myanmar’s international relations landscape in 2017: The increasing Chinese influence in the country and the immense diplomatic pressure from international community on the government’s handling of the Rakhine crisis.                         Analysts cautioned Myanmar against overdependence on China for its development and urged the country to mend ties with the West to ensure a balanced growth.           Growing China influenceAfter the August 25 attacks by Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which the government labelled as a terrorist group, and the subsequent counter-insurgency operations by government security forces, over 650,000 Muslim people from northern Rakhine were forced to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh. The international community has accused the government forces of violating human rights during the clearance operations, which the latter vehemently denied.Amid mounting international pressure, China stood firmly on Myanmar’s side, vetoing attempts by Western nations to bring the issues to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in March. China said the crisis in Rakhine was Myanmar’s internal affairs, which should not be interfered.While its relations with the Western world soured, Myanmar builds closer ties with China. It has endorsed China’s strategic Belt and Road Initiative. President Xi Jinping and State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi agreed to speed up the building of the China-Myanmar economic corridor during a meeting in November last year.“The Chinese One Belt One Road initiative is big. It is globalisation by Chinese way. It’s so large that it encompasses about 60 countries, and it’s inevitable for us,” said U Aung Thu Nyein, a political commentator.China also has deep involvement in Myanmar’s peace process that is the topmost policy priority of the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party, by influencing armed ethnic organisations that are active along Myanmar-China border and by acting as a moderator, and sometimes as advisor in the domestic peace process. For instance, three armed ethnic groups were allowed by government to attend as observer at the opening ceremony of the second round of 21st Century Panglong Conference held last May because of China’s last-minute negotiation. The three ethnic armed groups, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (Kokang) and Arakan Army were previously not invited by government to attend such event.The exchange of views during the visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Myanmar’s top regime leaders Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hliang last year has also clearly exhibited that Myanmar and China are enjoying closer ties than in the past.Due to the protection it accorded to Myanmar against international community’s pressure on the Rakhine conflict, China’s reputation inside Myanmar has quickly changed from too negative to slight optimism.Waning relations with the WestBecause of its differing views in resolving the crisis in Rakhine, the relations between NLD and the Western world have strained.Since the crisis unfolded in 2016, the reputation of de facto leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as a democracy icon, has diminished greatly.Criticisms against her were focused on her failure to speak for the Muslim community in Rakhine – perceived as the most persecuted minority group in the world. Amid allegations Myanmar troops had used disproportionate force in its operations against the ARSA and committed human rights violations, Western nations, most noticeably the European Union and Britain, suspended its military assistance to the Tatmadaw.Unless the human rights situation in Rakhine state are improved, assistance would be delayed, World Bank and EU also announced.While there is widespread domestic acceptance that the international pressure on Myanmar concerning Rakhine is a clear sign of interference on Myanmar’s domestic affairs, some analysts believe this is because of rivalry between superpowers.U Kyaw Win, an author of several books and a political analyst said the international pressure was intentional, to slowdown China’s ‘One Belt One road’ initiative.“By letting Myanmar solve its internal problem alone, then the Chinese initiative of ‘One Belt One Road’ will succeed without facing difficulties. I think they have touched the Rakhine crisis to counter-balance the Chinese initiative,” he said.He said the impacts of rivalry between the superpowers are inevitable to small countries like Myanmar, which people in Myanmar should be aware of and be patient to endure.Sanctions, and then what? While sanctions against Myanmar are highly unlikely, an international embargo could hamper the country’s economic growth. The United States last month placed former commander of Western Command General Maung Maung Soe on its list of individuals facing targeted sanctions over his alleged involvement in northern Rakhine abuses.Yun Sun, senior associate at the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center, reminded Myanmar of the consequences of Western nations’ sanctions imposed on the country decades ago. “I think Myanmar should be very careful of what it is running into. Ten years ago, it was in a similar situation on human rights violations where China vetoed a UNSC resolution in protection of the military government. And the result was the overwhelming Chinese influence in the country’s economy and politics. Over dependence on any single country is not a good idea,” she said.Due to the embargo imposed against Myanmar in the past, it was forced to inevitably do business with China. Deals on many investment projects including the controversial Myitsone mega hydropower plan was made during the rule of military regime. The International Crisis Group on its report in December warned policy makers from the West to resist the urge to disengage Myanmar as it is home to millions of poorest people in the region, and their aspirations for a better economic future must not be forgotten.It also suggested that Western countries should maintain development assistance and trade preferences recently reinstated by the EU and US are critical in supporting manufacturing jobs in Myanmar and should not be revoked. But it also urged to maintain non-military engagement.Need to repair  ties with the WestAnalysts noted Myanmar should repair its relations with the West to have more balanced development. With the lifting of sanctions after 2010, the door for Myanmar products were opened to the European market. As a consequence, Myanmar’s economic growth in 2013 soared to 8.3 percent, fastest among the emerging and growing economies.Having healthy relations with Western countries would be of great significant for the country’s growing economy, said Vicky Bowman, director of Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business.“Western countries provide investment capital to Myanmar and markets for its goods,” she said.Bowman said 44pc of the export market for the Myanmar garment sector were European countries in 2016. Local businesses could get larger benefits from Western tourists than regional travelers from Thailand and China due to their high-end and high margin nature.“There is also a risk that reduction in investment from Western countries reduces the pressure for reform, and the pressure for improved environmental and social performance by business, greater transparency and less corruption,” Vicky Bowman said.U Kyaw Win said the Western countries will be more reliable in providing significant help in developing Myanmar. “The transfer of the most effective technology to drive Myanmar’s growth is expected to be coming from (the investments of) the West. The assistance of the West is very important for Myanmar’s change process,” he said.The way Myanmar handles its troubled Rakhine State should be long-term and visionary. For instance, granting access to international humanitarian organisations and assistance into Rakhine and letting local and foreign journalists to freely do their jobs in the state with zero restriction would be easy things for government to do.“In the past, hostile response to the international pressure did not work. Now, government should remember that it needs smart ways to respond the pressure from abroad,” U Kyaw Win said.Bowman said the country’s deteriorating human rights record and the detention of journalists would imprint negative perception to potential investors from the West. The announcement of Myanmar military last September that the country faces heightened security risk has frightened visitors and businesses.Myanmar should not stop diplomatic relations with the West despite current setbacks over the handling of the Rakhine crisis, Yun Sun said.“Alienating great powers one after another only hurts Myanmar’s own credibility, its reputation and its future, presenting Myanmar as fickle, wayward and unprincipled,” she said.“It will gradually eliminate the choices available for Myanmar, which will not be in its interests in the long run,” Yun Sun added.","/news/myanmar-better-good-graces-west.html"
"46",46,"Ten developments that shaped the economy in 2017",2017-12-29,"Business","2017 was an eventful year for Myanmar, with the economy charting major developments that brought in approved foreign direct investments (FDI) of around $4.5 billion between April and November, created thousands of jobs for locals and propelled larger segments of the population into the middle-class.                         These included opening up the taxi industry to foreign ride-hailing service providers, approving a slew of new hotels and mixed development projects and taking steps to ease a debilitating liquidity crunch that has stifled growth and innovation among the local small and medium enterprises.          For the 2016-17 fiscal year, Myanmar’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA) expects total approved FDI to exceed last year’s $6.7 billion total.On the downside, investor confidence in the government’s ability to execute important laws and economic reforms has slipped. According to the second Myanmar business confidence survey conducted by Roland Berger in partnership with Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI) in the latter half of 2017, short-term business sentiment plummeted to just 49 percent between June and August compared to 73pc a year ago. Meanwhile, some investors may also be holding back funds as the crisis in northern Rakhine State unfolds, said the World Bank.On the whole, despite inching up a notch on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index, the country still remains one of the least attractive countries regionally in which to do business. The World Bank has lowered its growth projections for 2016-17 to 5.9pc, below expectations and slower than growth of 7pc in 2015-16. To sum things up, here are ten economic milestones and setbacks that shaped the Myanmar economy this year:           ten_2.jpg                International ride-hailing apps make debutMalaysia’s Grab and US-headquartered Uber made their debut in Yangon in the first half of the year, joining local taxi operators Oway Ride and Hello Cabs.The companies aim to make it easier for commuters to book taxis and for taxi drivers to find passengers by providing a more efficient taxi booking platform.The companies were encouraged by Yangon Region Chief Minister U Phyo Min Thein to launch in the city and raise competition in the local taxi industry through better service quality and by creating a system of fairer taxi fares.In Yangon, most of the estimated 60,000 taxis plying the streets are operated by individual owners and fares are negotiated between the driver and prospective passenger. There are no metered fares. To add to the problem, many drivers are not trained to read maps or treat customers professionally. There is no system to track a taxi – such as via GPS – if problems arise. At night, taxi drivers will usually opt out of accepting trips to inconvenient destinations. They refuse passengers if there is a traffic jam during rush hour as well. Road and personal safety are also issues.In that light, the Yangon government’s aim is for taxi service operators to train drivers, foster healthy competition within the sector and provide traffic data for the regional government to ease traffic congestion and the city’s transport system.          ten_3.jpg                Vehicle import policy changes market dynamicsIn October, the government announced a new vehicle import policy under which only imports of new left-hand-drive cars will be permitted from next year on. The move aims to align vehicles with existing road rules, which are drawn up for left-hand-drive vehicles. By doing so, the government intends to gradually phase out older right-hand-drive vehicles to improve safety and traffic congestion on the roads. Currently, imported used right-hand-drive cars are most widely driven in the country even though these cars do not comply with road regulations. Most of the vehicles are made by Toyota.While prices of existing right-hand-drive cars have risen in anticipation of a shortage in the future, demand for new left-hand-drive cars is expected to rise over the longer term as car makers from the US, China and South Korea enter the market.          ten_4.jpg                Backlash on draft bills concerning foreignersTwo draft bills -the Law Concerning Foreigners and Foreign Worker Law- pegged as official priorities for the government, drew criticism from lawyers and analysts for encouraging red tape and creating an environment hostile to foreign investments.  The Law Concerning Foreigners requires non-Myanmar citizens who are above the age of 10 and who are planning on residing in the country for more than 90 days to obtain a Foreigner Registration Certificate (FRC) and carry it at all times.The clause which gained the most criticism concerns internal travel. In order for the FRC holder to make a trip within Myanmar of more than 24 hours, the prior approval of a “registrar” – defined as someone who heads a township immigration, manpower office or higher – is necessary. Failure to comply could result in a maximum one-year prison sentence.In a joint statement, nine foreign business chambers have also expressed concern over the draft laws, saying the requirements were excessive and would be an impediment for companies to establish businesses or post foreign workers in Myanmar.Vicky Bowman, director of the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business, said the draft laws open up a host of potential problems, ranging from additional administrative delays to increasing the opportunities to impose “tea money” bribes.“Any interaction with government authorities which involves obtaining permission is a corruption risk, and that really worries foreign investors,” she said.The laws are still being redrafted.          ten_5.jpg                Negotiations with Chinese stall  Myanmar officially got onboard China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The initiative involves China underwriting billion-dollar investments in physical infrastructure across the region, creating an extensive trade network by linking the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa. The scheme drew much interest in Myanmar when State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi paid a visit to the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing in May. Yet, Nay Pyi Taw has made little progress in pushing related infrastructure projects ahead.That’s because businesses are wary of taking on expensive debt and transparency issues when dealing with China.This has continued to stall negotiations between China and Myanmar over the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ), which consists of an industrial park and a $7.2 billion deep-sea port in Rakhine State. The port is a strategic asset for the Chinese under BRI.Under the initial shareholder structure permitted by the government under U Thein Sein in 2015, it was agreed that China would hold an 85pc stake in the deep-sea port, with Myanmar holding the remaining 15pc.Yuan Shaobin, executive president of CITIC Myanmar, told The Myanmar Times in an exclusive interview in October that the company had agreed to Myanmar taking a higher 30pc stake though. He also said more negotiations were needed to iron out the financing details. CITIC heads the Chinese consortium in negotiations with Myanmar over Kyaukphyu.He emphasised the ball is now in Nay Pyi Taw‘s court and it is up to the government to move negotiations forward.Business confidence plummetsAt least three reports and surveys showed a plunge in business and investor confidence in the government. More than three quarters of the 600 companies in the Roland Berger/UMFCCI survey cited poor implementation or the lack of a clear economic policy as the main reason for their waning confidence in the economy. That is likely to be the root cause of Myanmar’s failure to attract higher FDI volumes this year.Findings from EuroCham Myanmar’s second Business Confidence Survey showed more than three quarters of the 70 European companies active in Myanmar rated the business environment as poor or needing improvement compared to 67pc in 2016. In fact, about a third believed the business environment had changed for the worse during the past 12 months compared to just 18pc in 2016. The companies cited regulatory issues, lack of a qualified labour force and legal uncertainty as the biggest challenges in Myanmar.The World Bank noted that investment demand had also decelerated during the year as private investors held back their plans pending greater clarity in the government’s economic agenda and as the Rakhine humanitarian crisis continues to unfold, it said.Government flip-flops on important legislationJust a week after it was approved, top officials from DICA said implementation of the long-awaited Myanmar Companies Law could only take place from August 2018 onwards, after bylaws were prepared and a company registry vital to enforcing the law was completed.The Myanmar Companies Law, which replaces rules made over a century ago, was approved by President U Htin Kyaw on December 6 without a commencement date specified.The new law, which was initiated by the former military-backed government in 2014, establishes guidelines on how a company is run and governed, removing outdated rules on share transfers and offering greater protection to shareholders.Among the new regulations is one allowing foreign companies to take up to a 35pc stake in local companies, bringing about badly needed reforms for cash-strapped businesses in the local economy.The Companies Law was approved even as two other important laws - the Investment Law and Condominium Law - took effect this year. Fifth company approved to list on YSXTMH Telecom Public Company received approval in December to become the fifth company to list on the Yangon Stock Exchange (YSX). The announcement was made this month, amid dismal trading volumes on the exchange. TMH provides telecommunications, internet and top-up services. It became a public company in May 2016. The company will put up to 544,537 shares priced between K3,000 and K3,300 for sale in its Initial Public Offiering, which will enable it to raise a maximum of K1.6 billion in proceeds, according to its preliminary prospectus lodged on the YSX on December 2.Around 70pc of the funds raised will be used for equipment and labour costs associated with 126 telecommunications towers in Mandalay and Shan regions. Shares of TMH Telecom will begin trading on the YSX in the third or fourth week of January 2018.Central Bank eases up on regulationsThe Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) said November that a maximum of three years would be given to banks to recover the overdraft loans that make up the bulk of their lending. The original deadline was January 2018, six months after the regulations were introduced in July. Overdraft loans are estimated to amount to $9 billion, representing about 70pc of local banks’ total lending. The CBM will now allow banks to keep debt in the form of overdrafts - most of which were made on open-ended, preferential terms with customers - at 50pc of their loan books by July 2018 and 20pc by 2020. The announcement came shortly after the CBM also permitted local banks to extend loans without the need for collateral in the form of land or property, provided they have the proper risk management procedures in place, U Set Aung, Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Planning and Finance, told The Myanmar Times in October.The CBM also took progressive steps towards regulating companies in financial technology (fintech). In August, it issued a Mobile Financial Services (MFS) license to Ok Dollar, which provides money transfer services. When it received its license this year, Ok Dollar had been providing unlimited money transfers for a year and claimed to already have 100,000 users. The CBM’s licensing procedures for fintech companies were discussed by MPs during a Yangon Region Parliament session in October. Daw Sandar Min, MP for Seikgyi Khanaungto township, said the Central Bank should take better care in regulating such firms to prevent fraud.Largest gas power plant readyOn December 24, officials from the Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MOEE), Mandalay Electricity Supply Corporation and the Electricity Supply Enterprise visited and inspected the construction site of a combined-cycle gas turbine power plant in Myingyan, Mandalay.The first of its kind in Myanmar, the $300 million, 225-megawatt gas-fired plant is being constructed by Singapore’s Sembcorp Industries, which signed a build-operate-transfer (BOT) agreement with the MOEE in January. Under the agreement, Sembcorp Myingyan Power Company will build and operate the power plant for 22 years, after which the facility will be transferred to the Myanmar government. Two 71.5-megawatt gas turbine engines for the plant are now being generated on a test basis, with power distribution from those engines slated for January 2018, according to a statement from the government.Mixed use development projects gain tractionThe official opening of international luxury hotel Pan Pacific Yangon on December 8 marked the completion of Phase 1 of Junction City, a mixed-development project launched by Shwe Taung Group and Singapore’s Keppel Land.Pan Pacific Yangon will expand the offerings currently provided by the Junction City Shopping Centre and Junction City Tower, a Grade-A office block. Construction of Phase 2 of Junction City, comprising serviced residences and offices, will commence in 2018.The launch came shortly after Singapore-listed Yoma Strategic Holdings in November signed an agreement to build Yoma Central, which will feature Peninsula-branded luxury residences, two Grade A office towers, a business hotel and serviced apartments.The project will be developed under Meeyahta Development Ltd, a joint-venture between Yoma Strategic, First Myanmar Investment Company (FMIC), several companies under Mitsubishi, the International Finance Corporation and the Asia Development Bank.A second project will see the former headquarters of the Burma Railway Company restored into a luxury hotel called Peninsula Yangon. This project is a joint venture between the Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels , Yoma Strategic and FMIC.Both projects will occupy a10-acre site near Bogyoke Aung San Road, not far from Junction City, and are expected to be complete in 2021. The combined contract value is over $400 million.","/news/ten-developments-shaped-economy-2017.html"
"47",47,"China’s growing footprint on the natural world",2017-12-22,"Opinion","Many observers of China’s escalating global programme of foreign investment and infrastructure development are crossing their fingers and hoping for the best. In an ideal world, China’s unbridled ambitions will improve economic growth, food security and social development in many poor nations, as well as enriching itself.                         Such hopes are certainly timely, given the isolationism of the United States Trump administration, which has created an international leadership vacuum that China is eager to fill.          But a close look reveals that China’s international agenda is far more exploitative than many realise, especially for the global environment. And the Chinese leadership’s claims to be embracing “green development” are in many cases more propaganda than fact.To help steer through the maze, I provide here a snapshot of China’s present environmental impacts. Are China’s assertions reasoned and defensible, or something else altogether?Predatory force?For a start, China is overwhelmingly the world’s biggest consumer of illegally poached wildlife and wildlife products. From rhino horn, to pangolins, to shark fins, to a menagerie of wild bird species, Chinese consumption drives much of the global trade in wildlife exploitation and smuggling.Over the past 15 years, China’s rapacious appetite for ivory has largely driven a global collapse of elephant populations. In response to growing international criticism, China promised to shut down its domestic ivory trade by the end of 2017.But even before China’s ban has taken full force, a black market for ivory is developing in neighbouring Laos. There, Chinese entrepreneurs are churning out great quantities of carved ivory products, specifically designed for Chinese tastes and openly sold to Chinese visitors.China is also the world’s biggest importer of illegal timber, a trade that imperils forests while defrauding developing nations of billions of dollars each year in timber royalties.China claims to be working to reduce its illegal timber imports, but its efforts are half-hearted at best, judging by the amount of illegal timber still flowing across its border with Myanmar.More damaging still are China’s plans for infrastructure expansion that will irreparably degrade much of the natural world.China’s One Belt One Road initiative alone will carve massive arrays of new roads, railroads, ports, and extractive industries such as mining, logging, and oil and gas projects into at least 70 nations across Asia, Europe, and Africa.Chinese President Xi Jinping promises that the Belt and Road initiative will be “green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable”, but such a claim is profoundly divorced from reality.As my colleagues and I recently argued in Science and Current Biology, the modern infrastructure tsunami that is largely being driven by China will open a Pandora’s box of environmental crises, including large-scale deforestation, habitat fragmentation, wildlife poaching, water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.Mining projects in AmazonChina’s pursuit of natural resources is also escalating across Latin America. In the Amazon, for example, big mining projects – many of which are feeding Chinese industries – don’t just cause serious local degradation, but also promote widespread deforestation from the networks of roads bulldozed into remote areas to access the mines.Overall, China is the most aggressive consumer of minerals on the planet, and the biggest driver of tropical deforestation.Beyond this, China is pushing to build a 5000-kilometre railroad across South America, to make it cheaper for China to import timber, minerals, soy and other natural resources from ports along South America’s Pacific coast. If it proceeds, the number of critical ecosystems that would be impacted by this project is staggering.A World Bank study of more than 3000 overseas projects funded or operated by China revealed how it often treats poor nations as “pollution havens” – transferring its own environmental degradation to developing nations that are desperate for foreign investment.Finally, much has been made of the fact that China is beginning to temper its appetite for domestic fossil-fuelled energy. It is now a leading investor in solar and wind energy, and recently delayed construction of more than 150 coal-fired electricity plants in China.These are unquestionably pluses, but they need to be seen in their broad context. In terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, China has exploded past every other nation. It now produces more than twice the carbon emissions of the United States, the second-biggest polluter, following the greatest building spree of coal, nuclear, and large-scale hydro projects in human history.Despite its new post-Trump role as the world’s de facto climate leader, China’s overall agenda could scarcely be described as green.Some would say it’s unfair to criticise China like this. They would argue that China is merely following a well-trodden path of exploitative development previously forged by other nations and colonial powers.A single-minded visionBut China is not the same as any other nation. The astounding growth and size of its economy, its dangerously single-minded vision for exploiting natural resources and land internationally, its intolerance of internal and external criticism, and its increasingly closed media and official myopia all combine to make it unique.President Xi admits that many Chinese corporations, investors and lenders operating overseas have often acted aggressively and even illegally. But he says his government is powerless to do much about it. The most notable government response to date is a series of “green papers” containing guidelines that sound good in theory but are almost universally ignored by Chinese interests overseas.Are Xi’s assertions of powerlessness believable? He increasingly rules China with an iron hand. Is it really impossible for China to guide and control its overseas industries, or are they simply so profitable that the government doesn’t want to?Of course, China’s huge international ambitions will have some positive effects, and could even be economically transformative for certain nations. But many other elements will benefit China while profoundly damaging our planet. Bill Laurance is distinguished research professor and Australian laureate at James Cook University.","/news/chinas-growing-footprint-natural-world.html"
"48",48,"Bumpy ride for tourism seen in 2018",2017-12-22,"National News","The tourism industry this year went beyond expectations despite the sudden outbreak of violence in the northern Rakhine State that gave the country a negative image, but the sector is expected to face a more challenging environment next year.                         Tourist arrivals in the first 11 months this year was 20 per cent higher compared with the same period last year, and it is likely the government’s expected target for the whole year can be achieve.          Government data showed that from January to November tourist arrivals reached 3.1 million, already topping the 2.9 million visitors that arrived in the country last year. Its target for 2017 is 3.5 million.Rakhine troubleThe Rakhine crisis erupted a one month before the start of the peak season and that initially dampened the expectations of the tourism sector.The crisis started on August 25, when Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) fighters, which the government labelled as terrorist organisation, attacked dozens of government security outposts in northern Rakhine State that led to clashes which resulted in the killing of hundreds of people.The fighting also forced more than 650,000 Muslim residents to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh to escape the violence.Western tourists, which used to be the primary target of the local tourism industry, began to avoid Myanmar as the crisis unfolded, opting for other destinations in the region.But the industry quickly shifted its focus to Chinese and Southeast Asian tourists, which paid off quickly, offsetting the decline from the western and European markets.  Also boosting the 2017 tourist arrivals was the fact that tour operators have sold their packages within the first six months of the year so the impact of the Rakhine crisis was not yet fully felt. But the real fallout from the Rakhine crisis likely be felt next year, according to industry players. “It would be trouble during first four months of 2018,” U Phyo Wai Yarzar, vice chair of Myanmar Tourism Federation told The Myanmar Times.“We clearly know the tourist arrivals number from January to March would be down, due to the impact of the Rakhine conflict. We can’t expect much,” he added.The foreign media, especially from western countries, strongly criticised Myanmar over the alleged human rights abuses perpetrated by government forces during clearance operations against the terrorists, scaring off western and European travellers from the country. There were 90 percent cancellations in Rakhine’s Mrauk-U itinerary and some impact in Ngapali too within two months of the uprising, according to tourism operators.“If there would be more negative reports in the foreign media and there would be more unfortunate events that might occur, we would have to wait for two or three more years for market stability,” U Thet Lwin Toh, chairman of Union of  Myanmar Travel Association, said.The most notable decline in the western market are those from Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Fortunately the number of visitor arrivals from the South Asia and ASEAN countries increased. According to the Ministry of Hotel and Tourism data, visitors from the Philippine and Vietnam rose 70pc and Singapore registered a 26pc increase. The tourism market developers are preparing to extend potential market destinations in South Asia and ASEAN rather than in Western and European markets.“We are preparing for the best in 2018. We will start market promotions for green season (low or rainy season) from February. Now we intend to extend promotions to the Philippine, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, India, China, Japan as our main market targets,” Daw May Myat Mon Win, chair of Myanmar Tourism Marketing Association said.Myanmar tourism is trying to break into the Chinese market and hopes to attract about one million Chinese visitors in the next two years.China is the biggest market in the world and Myanmar is just its neighbour. Thailand attracted 10 million Chinese visitors in 2016. Chinese travellers like to shop, U Pho Wai Yarzar said.“We have to prepare for many shopping places right now if we want to target the Chinese market and I suggest we target the high-end Chinese tourists,” he said.The domestic aviation sector has yet to be impacted by the Rakhine conflict but things can change quickly if some unforeseen negative events happen in 2018.  “We haven’t received booking cancellations until today and hope this good fortune will continue through 2018,” Daw Aye Mra Tha, general manager of Air Kanbawza airlines said. “We can’t change the current situation but hope for the best and prepare for the worse.” Domestic tourismThe country’s main tourist attraction sites like Bagan and Inle Lake recorded 20pc decline in international tourist arrivals but this was offset by the rise in the number of local tourists. According to Domestic Pilgrimages and Tour Operators Association’s statistics, local numbers are expected to reach 7.5  million end of the season in April. The association also noted an increase in the number of independent domestic travellers, which is not recorded in the association’s statistics. Despite the negative impact of the Rakhine unrest on the country’s image, foreign direct investment (FDI) in tourism sector is increasing, especially in the hotel sub-sector – a testament in the long-term viability of the country as tourist destination. According to the ministry’s statistics, FDI worth US$4.37 billion (K5.97 trillion) were channelled into 64 hotel project as of November, much higher than the $3.08 billion investments registered in the entire 2016.As of November 2017, there are 1, 575 hotels with 63, 336 rooms operating in the whole country, the ministry added. The tourism industry hopes the government makes good its promise to really work hard to achieve peace not only in the northern Rakhine State but throughout the country. “We hope that 2018 would be a peaceful year. Peace and tourism is intertwined. ‘Tourism is for peace’,” U Thet Lwin Toh said.","/news/bumpy-ride-tourism-seen-2018.html"
"49",49,"Japanese see value in Shan, Mon agriculture sector",2017-12-13,"Business","Japanese interest in the agriculture sector of Shan and Mon States is rising. In particular, investors see the opportunity to provide the machinery and equipment farmers need for harvesting their crops as well as high quality fertilisers and seeds.                         “In Japan, there are many companies that are interested in Myanmar as an investment and business destination,” said Hirokazu Yamaoka, Managing Director of the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) in Yangon.          The agriculture sector, in particular, is drawing a high level of investor interest. “As mechanisation in the agriculture sector is rising in importance, Japanese investors have been trying to enter this market,” Mr Yamaoka said, adding that many Japanese seed and fertiliser companies have also been eyeing the Myanmar market.Mr Yamaoka was speaking during an event announcing a JETRO mandate to source for investment opportunities in the Myanmar agriculture sector on behalf of Japanese businesses earlier this month. The mandate is similar to previous years’.This year, interest in Shan and Mon agriculture has seen keener interest. Together with JETRO, a total of 11 Japanese companies traveled to the two states to meet with 20 local firms and gauge market conditions.  As JETRO has a good relationship with the Cooperate Department of Mon State and finding solutions to selling products in cooperative retail stores, “we are looking at cooperative department retail stores in which to push sales since Japanese companies really want to sell their agricultural items in Myanmar but are finding it very difficult to find the right locations,” said Mr Yamaoka.Meanwhile, some Japanese companies are exploring ways to establish contract farming agreements to produce fresh vegetables with local farmers. The main purpose is to produce higher quality vegetables to be exported to Japan and ASEAN with a higher price, Mr Yamaoka said.“In Vietnam, there is a city called Dalat which is very similar to Shan State. In Dalat, the Japanese have successfully invested in the agriculture sector. We can copy this in Shan State,” he said.Shigeru Oi, Director and Chief Strategic Officer of Sugano Farm Machinery Company, one of the companies that visited Shan State, said more tractors and other machinery are needed.“We need to develop a pricing strategy that meets Myanmar demand. Then I think we can penetrate the Shan market by competing with existing Chinese machinery makers within 3 years,” he said.Mr Yamaoka agreed. “We have to come up with a strategy to compete with Chinese products that are dominating in Myanmar market,” he said. Based on available data, Japanese imports of Myanmar agricultural products amounted to more than $24 million during the 2015-16 fiscal year. Meanwhile, Japanese investments totaling $95 million were channeled into the local agriculture sector during the period. Among the Japanese companies invested in Myanmar areG7 AgriJapan, which entered in a joint venture in Myanmar to farm and sell agriculture products in 2013, as well as Myanmar Bell Company, which is a JV with Japanese partners produce and export frozen vegetables to Japan, establised in 2015.Meanwhile, Kubota Corporation, which makes tractors, has established a sales company in Myanmar, while trading company Marubeni Corporation has also established a fertiliser manufacturing company in the Thilawa Special Economic Zone.","/news/japanese-see-value-shan-mon-agriculture-sector.html"

The BGF started this new project in 2016 and it was submitted to the Kayin State government on September 18. The project area is near Koykko Myaing village, Myawady township, which is a BGF-controlled area on the border with Thailand. It received permission for 60 acres to start the project with investment by Jilin Yatai Group Co. Ltd. of China.          The company, which was established in 1993, and was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1995, is a mixed ownership and joint-stock company. Yatai Group ranked 329th on the list of China’s top 500 enterprises in 2016. The state government still needs to get the permission of the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) because the investment amount is over US$5 million (K6.8 billion), said Daw Nan Khin Htwe Myint, the chief minister of Kayin State.“The total project area is over 1300 acres and the total investment amount is $1.5 billion, so they have to get a permit from the MIC,” she said.A spokesperson for the MIC said it had not received the project proposal yet.Residents guess that the project involves building a casino on the border with Thailand.There are already four casinos in Myawady under the protection of the BGF. If this project involves building another casino, it will need further discussion because gambling is illegal in Myanmar, said U Tayza Htut Hlaing Htwe, Myanmar ethnic minister of Kayin State.The city extension project has already started, with delivery of equipment and building of temporary workers quarters, said Major Mg Win, the BGF official in charge of the area.Colonel Chit Thu, senior adviser and general secretary of the Kayin State BGF central command, said the lead investor in the project is Myanmar Jilin Yatai International Holding Group. The total planned area of the project is 180,000 acres and an investment of $15 billion.According to the proposal by the group, the project will include science and technology, entertainment, tourist, and cultural areas, as well as expressways and an international airport.","/news/border-guards-plan-city-extension-project-chinese-firm.html"
"51",51,"Asia to be global e-commerce centre?",2017-12-07,"Opinion","Online retailer Alibaba said it sold over US$25 billion (K34.07 trillion) in merchandise during its “Ali-double-11” e-shopping festival on November 11. Another leading e-commerce platform, JD.com, reported a $19 billion in online orders the same day.                         Asia is benefiting more than any other region in the world from the global e-commerce boom, which has introduced a new dynamic to international trade. Global retail e-commerce sales have grown faster than traditional retail sales since 2014.          E-commerce in many Asian markets will see double-digit growth in the next five to ten years. India, Indonesia, and Malaysia are among the fastest-growing retail e-commerce markets in the world – at over 20 percent a year. E-commerce in China is growing at an annual rate of around 17pc. From 2015 to 2021, the region’s total market revenue from e-commerce will increase from around $320 billion to over $900 billion, the Chinese market contributing over 90pc of this growth.China’s share of the global e-commerce market will increase from about 30pc in 2015 to nearly 40pc in 2021, while India and the ASEAN states will increase their combined share of the global market from 2.5pc to four percent. With growth like this, Asia is likely to be the global centre of e-commerce by 2025.What drives this intense growth?First, adaptiveness. Economic digitalisation is a worldwide phenomenon. The information revolution is associated with the emergence of new market conditions and dynamics in a global business environment. To some extent, the region’s adaptiveness to global economic digitalisation comes from its capacity to adopt new technology and incremental innovation. On the one hand, the deep involvement of global value chains opens the window for developing Asia to access the latest technologies and facilitates their adoption. At the same time, its capacity for incremental innovation allows it to grow faster and even leapfrog to the front of the market. The popularity of e-payments in China and the success of the Alibaba group are examples. In ASEAN, facilitating the growth of e-commerce is one of the six main areas covered by the e-ASEAN Framework Agreement, while at the national level, developing a digital economy and e-commerce are already part of most Asian countries’ strategies and action plans.Second, market gravitation. Despite the new features of a digital economy, the development of e-commerce is still influenced by traditional conditions for economic development, such as market size, trade facilitation, investment freedom, and so on. Asia covers almost half the world’s population, nearly 30pc of the world’s Gross Domestic Product and 40pc of world trade. In age distribution, 70pc of ASEAN’s population is 15 to 64, representing a large consumer market and labour force. By 2015, more than 1.2 billion people, or about half the households in the region, had internet access.A population connected to the internet not only represents consumers linked to the e-commerce market but also those who may have higher purchasing power. In ASEAN, internet connectivity is widespread in Singapore and Malaysia, and plays an important role in their economies. Nearly 90pc of households in Singapore use the internet.In 2012, the internet-related economy accounted for 4.1pc of Malaysia’s national gross domestic product, and the less-developed countries of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam are quickly catching up. The number of internet users in Vietnam increased from 1.3pc to 52.7pc between 2001 and 2015, and grew 34.7pc in Cambodia and 32.4pc in Myanmar annually.Third, readiness. E-commerce development needs support from technology, market, and government policy. A country’s readiness to support the digital economy will determine the level of success of businesses involved in e-commerce. Information communication technology – especially the use of fibre-optic cables and commercial satellites – drives the development of e-commerce by expanding the volume and capacity of online communication. Moreover, physical infrastructure that provides a stable and fast internet connection is a precondition for e-commerce development. In particular, many emerging Asian countries have made great progress in developing mobile broadband. Almost 80pc of Chinese users and two-thirds of ASEAN users access the internet on smart phones. Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam have among the highest growth rate for mobile subscriptions – ranging from 36pc in Cambodia to 70pc in Myanmar. India’s smart phone penetration rate is projected to increase from 58pc in 2015 to 74pc in 2021.All these are reasons to endorse e-commerce development.The most urgent task is to build a region-wide environment conducive to e-commerce, for which market mechanisms should take the lead but the role of policy intervention should not be neglected. For instance, e-commerce value chains depend on both physical and virtual factors. It needs the government to set rules, regulations, and legislation to ensure the security and stability of both the physical and virtual parts of the market, which are required for growth.In addition to national efforts, progress toward regional integration has provided policymakers extra channels to promote e-commerce development via market integration and cooperation, especially in harmonising regulations and liberalising services. When thinking of long-term e-commerce success, human capital and innovation are key, which not only require more and better education and training, but also region-wide service liberalisation to improve mobility and diffuse knowledge.The region’s potential for e-commerce has increasingly drawn policy attention. Asian countries are making more inter-governmental efforts to cooperate. The ongoing negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership include extensive discussion of e-commerce and related issues, including consumer protection, data localisation, intellectual property rights, and cybersecurity. It is not too ambitious to foresee a chapter on e-commerce and digital trade in the final agreement of the RCEP like that in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Even so, Asian countries still need to make persistent efforts to implement these agreements, which are crucial to success.Lurong Chen is an economist at the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.","/news/asia-be-global-e-commerce-centre.html"

If completed, the oil refinery would have been the largest in Myanmar. The project, which is backed by the Chinese, had received approval under the former government led by then president U Thein Sein.           When contacted by The Myanmar Times, U Aung Naing Oo, secretary general of Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) confirmed that the project was cancelled during a meeting held in mid-November.The decision was made after military-linked Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL), the Myanmar investor of the project, submitted a proposal to pull back the project, citing no progress at all in the two years since receiving approval.""MEHL submitted the official report about not being able to implement the project to MIC. The main problem is the Chinese investor has not shown any progress since the project was approved. And MIC accepted the cancellation of the project,"" he said. The estimated $2.6 billion project was to be constructed by Chinese developer Guangdong Zhenrong Energy Co. It would have been the first oil refinery built by the company. The Chinese had negotiated for a 70 percent stake in the project together with a consortium of investors including MEHL, state-owned Myanma Petrochemical Enterprise (MPE) and Yangon Engineering Group, which is controlled by the Htoo Group.          south-dawei.jpg                The site of the project would have been on 1,634 acres of land owned by MEHL,  directly in front of Tizit beach, with pipelines cutting through the nearby villages.In fact, many residents in nearby Hnyin Maw village had raised concerns over being forced to relocate should construction have taken place. More than 2,000 residents from 6 nearby villages have so far signed a petition calling for the project to be scrapped within 2 months of receiving MIC approval. U Mg Mg Aye, vice chair of Dawei Nationalities Party and resident of Hnyin Maw village voiced doubt over how the area could sustain this multi-million dollar project.""All the villagers are very glad that the project has been cancelled.

But the foreign investor has failed to do so because of financial difficulties. So we submitted a request to MIC to cancel the project,"" he said.U Hla Myo insisted the project was cancelled not because of government objections or community complaints, but because of the financial difficulties faced by its Chinese investor.","/news/myanmars-largest-oil-refinery-project-cancelled.html"
"53",53,"SMEs need to find niche to fend off tech giants, Kerry Globalink warns",2017-12-01,"Business","LOGISTICS and e-commerce will offer opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises in Myanmar that are able to develop a niche and offer customised solutions, a leading logistics expert said.                         At the seventh Asian Logistics and Maritime Conference in Hong Kong last week, The Myanmar Times spoke to Siddique Khan, CEO of Kerry Globalink Logistics about the implications of regional trade initiatives and technology on Myanmar’s logistics and e-commerce industry.          Kerry Globalink Logistics is a joint venture between supply chain solutions provider Kerry Logistics Network and freight forwarder Globalink Logistics.The Myanmar Times: For the logistics sector, would Belt and Road allow smaller economies like Myanmar to reap substantial economic rewards?Siddique Khan: The logistics sector is servicing the trade, and as the trade grows, logistics businesses grow – hand-in-hand. For the Belt and Road, it’s also about trade facilitation. China is moving westward, investing in Central Asia, Pakistan – even Afghanistan, the Caucasus and Russia. Investing means that China is not going to start exporting finished goods, they’ve already been doing that. China is going to be focusing on local manufacturing and assembling because some places in Asia like Vietnam or Myanmar are a lot more attractive in terms of labour costs – whereas China’s labour costs, over the last 10 years, has tripled or more. As the Chinese GNP grows, so too does the cost of manufacturing basic goods. That means that China has to really shift their assembly and manufacturing outside of China. And of course, neighbouring countries and Central Asia will have direct benefit which will go towards small and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs] who are at the forefront of trading. SMEs don’t have to go deeper into China to secure their goods; China’s goods are coming closer to them. That means a lot more trading facilities and cross-border trade – this is where logistics comes in. As the business grows, the trade volume grows – logistic services will grow alongside. How should SMEs in smaller economies, like those in Myanmar, prepare for this change?For a business to scale from small to medium, or medium to large, it is not easy – there is always a question of supply and demand. Ten years ago, small enterprises who were selling niche products didn’t have enough resources to distribute beyond their cities. But the e-commerce platforms that we see, small-time manufacturers who are niche, are able to put their products on those platforms. Some very basic things made in Asia are bought in Europe by e-commerce platforms – it’s not about those four to five global giants. Of course, they [global giants] were the early investors. But future-wise, it’s about a lot of SMEs who are benefiting from e-commerce distribution platforms which is more attractive than physical distribution.           page_10_story_1a.jpg                We have a customer which is a nice manufacturer of cosmetics. Their reach now is about as big as a global brand because they’re using e-commerce platforms to reach out to their consumers. That’s why we see Belt and Road driving infrastructure development. It’s making the cost of mobility more attractive, cross-border trade is being promoted, and this is where SMEs will use e-commerce more to increase their sales. Again, it’s a whole cycle, multiple factors that will contribute to SMEs’ development.There are concerns that big tech giants would be coming into the region and dominate the game. Do you think that will happen or will smaller companies in Southeast Asia still have room to play?For now, that’s the trend: big tech giants have the resources and are expanding rapidly. But at the same time, a larger size loses flexibility and customised solutions. You would see global giants like those in the automotive sector, but then you also have niche market players who are also producing automobiles who have their own marketplace. E-commerce is for players who will find their niche and compete with big tech giants but can offer more customised solutions.Could you explain why connectivity and common platforms are the two solutions for international trade?Connectivity - we feel that we can easily build the economy of scale and reduce the cost of doing business in many of these countries. But you see a lot of wastage: cost of distribution depends on quality of infrastructure – land or sea-based. We also see increased efficiency in law enforcement, customs, border control and immigration and how they create bottlenecks and how the cost is paid.Common platform means that every country that wants to take the benefit of global e-commerce have to build soft infrastructure. There is so much investment going into ‘hard’ infrastructure, there are many instances where there are perfect roads, but then the digital solutions around customs, documentation, border crossing is not there. This is where soft infrastructure needs to compliment classic infrastructure – the digital backbone needs to be built and where public-private-partnerships (PPP) needs to be fostered. There are instances in Belt and Road countries where law enforcement and customs are totally detached from the economic development in the country. It has to be a more inclusive platform: economic development has to go hand-in-hand with legislative development which creates ease of doing business. By not harmonising your various laws, you’re only increasing the cost of mobility, which is then passed onto the consumer. Consumers are the ones who are paying the price.","/news/smes-need-find-niche-fend-tech-giants-kerry-globalink-warns.html"

This was due to a surge in trading of shares in First Myanmar Investments Limited (FMIL), one of the four companies listed on the Yangon Stock Exchange.Trade volumes first spiked on November 22, after SHC Capital Asia, an investment holding company listed in Singapore, said it is planning to acquire MM Myanmar, a tourism company, from FMIL and its other shareholders for a total of S$69.7 million. MM Myanmar comprises the Experiences business, which includes Balloons Over Bagan and Bagan Land, while the Services businessincludes the Asia Holidays travel agency. The Hotels business comprises Hpa-An Lodge and Pun Hlaing Lodge.There are some caveats to the deal though. If the authorities do not provide the necessary approvals for the Bagan businesses, for example, FMIL must buy them back from SHC Asia.FMIL rose xx percent during the week to close at K13,000 a share. At those levels, the company is valued at K335.7 billion.Singapore, Vietnam highThe Singapore stock market closed the week at a 2.5-year high after data released showed industrial output in October climbed for a fifteenth straight month. Industrial production was up 14.6pc for the month compared to 14.4pc in September, buoyed by higher output in the electronics sector. Singapore’s Straits TimesIndex gained 1.8pc during the week, led by Thai Beverage, which last month bought a 75pc stake in Myanmar Distillery Company Group (MDC) for S$1 billion. MDC brews Myanmar’s most popular Grand Royal whisky. The stock rose 3.2pc last week, followed by DBS Group Holdings, which rose 1.5pc. In Vietnam, stocks rose 5pc during the week to close at a 2-year high, led by beer companies Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp and Hanoi Beer Alcohol and Beverage Joint Stock company, which gained 3.6pc and 3.2pc for the period, respectively.Chinese jittersAs a whole though, ASEAN bourses were softer after China introduced new liquidity rules in the country November 23. The rules restrict banks’ ability to buy bonds with borrowed money and to lend to corporate clients through off-balance-sheet channels. They are designed to curb shadow banking and reduce domestic debt.Chinese shares tumbled 3pc after the rules were announced. Earlier, the yield for China 10-year sovereign bonds exceeded 4pc, the highest level in 3 years. Investors are concerned that Beijing’s rising efforts to rein in runaway debt growth will slow its economy.

"55",55,"Singapore opens new hotel in Yangon,  remains confident of long term ROI",2017-11-24,"Business","Wee Wei Ling, executive director of Pan Pacific Hotel Group, isn’t at all worried about the glut in hotel rooms in Yangon. “There is definitely an oversupply. In fact, tourism has been declining recently. But we are long-term investors in Myanmar. We see the potential of this country and we would like to grow with it. That is why we are here,” she said.                         Owned by Singapore-listed property conglomerate UOL Group, the company opened Pan Pacific Yangon last month, amid an unfolding humanitarian crisis in northern Rakhine, which has deterred some investors and tourists from entering Myanmar. The 333-room luxury hotel is part of the Junction City Yangon mixed-development project by Shwe Taung Group and Keppel Land and took more than 3 years to build. The opening of Pan Pacific Yangon also came after several new luxury hotel openings in the city, including South Korean Lotte Group’s Lotte Hotel on Pyay Road in September. Meanwhile, handful of other hotels in the same space, such as Kempinski Yangon by Germany’s Kempinski Group and Pullman Yangon Centrepoint by French group AccorHotels, are also scheduled to start operations within the next few months.The new hotels join many other existing full-service ones in Yangon, including Novotel Yangon Max, Rose Garden Hotel Yangon, Sule Shangri-La Yangon, Sedona Hotel Yangon, Melia Yangon, Chatrium Hotel Royal Lake Yangon and ParkRoyal Yangon, which is also run by the Pan Pacific Hotel Group.Rising competitionMs Wee said rising competition in the sector should force each player to sharpen its strategy and find its own niche to draw new customers and retain existing ones. “The more competition, the better. We each just have to find our own niche,” she said.Pan Pacific Yangon’s edge is its location in the heart of town and proximity to the Junction City Shopping Mall. It is also marketing itself as a luxury hotel for corporate travellers. “Travellers who visit Yangon will be familiar with the Pan Pacific brand and its association with comfort and luxury,” Ms Wee said.The strategy for ParkRoyal Yangon, located on Alan Pya Phaya Road, is a little different. “It is more for returning locals and families. People come back to our hotels because of the staff and the little things that they do, like greeting returning guests by name and remembering details like how they like their breakfast,” Ms Wee said. “People come back to certain hotels because of the staff. They may try out a new hotel every now and then, but they usually go back to a hotel they feel comfortable with. We are certainly seeing this for ParkRoyal.”Long term plansAlthough competition is rising and while tourism recently took a hit, capital investments have continued to flow into the hotels Pan Pacific Hotel Group operates in Yangon. In fact, renovations have been taking place at the ParkRoyal for over a year now. “Before last year, the number of ParkRoyal patrons was rising fast. So we decided to renovate the hotel. Since then, things have slowed. But we are renovating for the long term,” said Ms Wee.          wee-wei-ling.jpg                The group is now developing Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) units on the ParkRoyal Yangon tennis court grounds. “As the tennis courts are under-utilised, we are now building SOHOs there as we see rising demand for these properties, as opposed to 1 or 2-room suites like in the past,” she said. The units will be ready by February 2018.More importantly, the Pan Pacific Hotel Group enjoys strong shareholder backing. UOL is among Singapore’s largest property developers, with real estate projects across the world. The company also runs a third hotel in Myanmar, the ParkRoyal Nay Pyi Taw.UOL is controlled by the Wee family, which is also one of the richest families in Singapore. The Wees also own United Overseas Bank, the country’s oldest and largest bank.For the nine months to September 30, 2017, UOL announced revenues amounting to S$1.3 billion, up 18 percent over the same period last year. Earnings hit S$847.9 million, which is up 2.5 times year-on-year. Still, the company warned in its financial statements that its hotels, including those in Myanmar, “continue to face competitive pressures and oversupply of rooms.”While that will keep further expansion plans in Myanmar on hold for now, Ms Wee stressed that things will eventually pick up. “UOL is a long term player in the Myanmar market. Running 3 big hotels here is a big investment, but we are not worried about the money and reaping a return on investment (ROI). This shows we are confident and comfortable with the government despite the violence,” she said.Park Royal jazzes up restaurant offering for extra edgeParkRoyal Yangon, one of the hotels backed by Singapore property developer UOL Group, is jazzing up Si Chuan Dou Hua, its flagship Chinese restaurant, amid rising demand for Chinese cuisine in Yangon. When it opened 2 years ago in ParkRoyal Yangon, Si Chuan Dou Hua was one of the first authentic Chinese restaurants in the city. Now, with a larger number of similar restaurants such as Crystal Jade opening up, it is upping its game. “We are moving up to a different level to set ourselves apart from the competition. We think people like Chinese cuisine and the traditional round table, private room setting so we have brought in a Cantonese chef to guarantee the authenticity of the cuisine,” aid Wee Wei Ling, executive director of Singapore-owned Pan Pacific Hotel Group, which owns Si Chuan Dou Hua.With Chinese New Year around the corner, Si Chuan Dou Hua is also working on improving the quality of existing dishes like suckling pig and roast duck, as well as introducing new dishes which are popular with the Chinese. The company is targeting middle to upper class local consumers. “Chinese cuisine has evolved into a larger part of local dining. Demand and competition are rising so our food quality must be good,” said Ms Wee.“We will import certain ingredients but use local ingredients from the wet market as much as we can.”","/news/singapore-opens-new-hotel-yangon-remains-confident-long-term-roi.html"
"56",56,"Myanmar main beneficiary of Kyaukphyu: CITIC ",2017-11-23,"Business","YUAN Shaobin, executive president of CITIC Myanmar, which is the developer of a proposed Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Rakhine, disagrees with critics who have accused China of taking an unfairly large stake in the project.                         He insisted that Kyaukphyu SEZ will spur much-needed developments in the region and that comparing Kyaukphyu’s ownership structure to that of the Japan-backed Thilawa SEZ in Yangon is “unfair” and “not correct.”          Mr Yuan referred specifically to comments by Simon Tay, chair of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, who told The Myanmar Times in June that the difference in foreign ownership between Thilawa and Kyaukphyu is very “stark” and “noticeable”.“The Japanese really made an effort to work with Myanmar by giving Myanmar 51 percent. It is an important [gesture] as a sign of friendship and equality,” Mr Tay stated, adding that if he were to advise the Chinese consortium he “would never ask for 85 percent”.Under the shareholder structure permitted by the government under U Thein Sein, it was agreed that China would have an 85pc stake in the port, with Myanmar holding the remaining 15pc. Since the current government took charge, the Myanmar consortium has made new demands to raise its stake to 30pc as well as receive dividends, but does not what to shoulder any financing responsibility. That has led to delays in approving the project, which is currently still pending.SEZ will benefit RakhineKyaukphyu in Rakhine State is the location for a proposed SEZ which will include an industrial park and a deep-sea port. In 2015, a CITIC-led consortium involving China Harbor Engineering, China Merchants, TEDA Investment, Yunnan Construction Engineering Group and Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group won the bid to develop both the port and the industrial park.But the project drew flak from critics, who say the port holds more benefits for the Chinese than locals, as it serves as a gateway for China to the Middle East, reducing the country’s reliance on the Strait of Malacca.However, Mr Yuan told The Myanmar Times that the mega-project will mainly benefit Myanmar’s economy and support the growth of Yangon, Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw. Despite the project being a core part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, he argued that the benefits for China “won’t be much”.For one, employment opportunities will be made available for the local population, with around 2-3 thousand jobs created during the construction period of the port.“It [Kyaukphyu SEZ] will be beneficial to Myanmar and, of course, Rakhine. And when the deep-sea port becomes operational, we will be connected to Yangon, Nay Pyi Taw and Mandalay. It will help these three big cities do business and develop logistics networks,” he said.“It is hard to say when this project could benefit China -- it could take years. However, the benefits won’t be much. Myanmar will take 70pc and China, 30pc of the benefits.”Mr Yuan added that the distance between coastal China and the Kyaukphyu port is too great to render the logistics cost competitive compared to the Strait of Malacca.Foreign investmentsWarren Hua, legal advisor to CITIC Construction, argued that by investing in the development of the port and industrial park, the Chinese state-owned bank is in fact lending Rakhine a hand in improving its existing infrastructure.“What is going to be done by CITIC in Myanmar is exactly what happened in China years ago, before the Chinese economy boomed. In the mid-90’s, China lacked the money and technology to develop its infrastructure facilities. We introduced a lot of foreign investors to come into China to help us build ports and highways – that’s why the economy developed,” he said.For example, CITIC has plans to build a highway connecting Kyaukphyu port to Nay Pyi Taw. Through the capital city, the port would also be connected to Yangon and Mandalay, enabling it to connect with and serve nearly 60pc of Myanmar.“Without these facilities, who would be willing to come and invest here?”Now, the ball is in Nay Pyi Taw’s court. CITIC said that they have asked Nay Pyi Taw to approve an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) application since the beginning of this year but there has been no response from the government.“We will do an EIA. We note that any kind of investment or development will influence the environment – both negative and positive,” Mr Yuan said in relation to the environmental concerns.Mr Chua said it will take about 1.5 years to complete the EIA process. For now, “we are still waiting for the Myanmar government to issue the EIA,” he continued.","/news/myanmar-main-beneficiary-kyaukphyu-citic.html"
"57",57,"Chin to build infrastructure links for investment",2017-11-22,"Business","CHIN State, with a population of 478,801 as of 2014, is the least developed region in Myanmar and the second least populated. Basic infrastructure is still largely absent, and this has been a major hurdle for the Chin economy.                         Now, the regional government wants to attract investors by improving Chin’s road and maritime connectivity with other regions of the country as well as with neighbouring India.           In an exclusive interview during a November 17 and 18 investment workshop organised by the UK’s DaNa Facility, Directorate of Investment and Company Administration and the Chin state government, Chief Minister Salai Lian Luai spoke to The Myanmar Times about his plans to draw investments for further development.The Myanmar Times: Which are the top sectors for investment prioritised by the regional government?Salai Lian Luai: Eco-tourism is the top priority. Chin State has a lot of pristine and unspoiled mountains and natural landscape. In fact, we are in the process of demarcating seven places in this state as national parks, including Khonumsum. This demarcation will promote community-based tourism and attract more visitors. Mining for resources such as copper, chromite and necal is another sector in which we are looking for investments. Investment and projects should follow the procedures of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment as laid down by the new Investment Law.Since your cabinet took office, what are the priorities for development?Infrastructure is among the major priorities as no local or international business will be unconcerned by an infrastructure gap. In order to attract both foreign and domestic investors, the Chin State government mainly focuses on developing the road networks, power supply as well as housing supply.At the moment, the national grid is connected to Hakha and Falam townships in northern Chin State as well as Mindat and Kanpetlet townships in southern Chin. The government is trying to connect Tedim and Matupi townships with the national grid by next year. Power supply only covers 15pc of the urban households right now. This supply merely supports households and is totally insufficient for industries or factories. Hence we are looking to expand the power supply further.Which are the major concerns of the Chin community and your government?The infrastructure gap and food insecurity are the two major concerns for the people. Land issues involving the farms on the hills complicate the situation. The government is trying to move the farms away from cultivating temporary crops to permanent cultivation. This mitigates deforestation and increases productivity. Hillside cultivation only produces 50 percent of the state’s food consumption while the remaining half has to be imported from other regions.The community fully appreciates the magnitude of the issue of food insecurity but it is hard to push through changes overnight to solve the problem. We need to support the households in seeking alternative ways of generating revenue or adapting new technologies to produce fruits and flowers.          salai-lian-laui.jpg                The migrated hillside cultivation has led to serious deforestation. Thus, the government wants the people involved to find another way of living. At the same time, the government needs to offer support in terms of research, technology and loans for the local community. These are big challenges. The government budget is insufficient or very limited in terms of fulfilling infrastructure and electricity. This is why we very much need investments in those sectors.How are the infrastructure projects in Chin State? What is in the pipeline?We are trying to establish the Paletwa Port and highways in order to have maritime and road access from Paletwa to Mizoram in India. Five areas in northern Chin are going to have bridges and road networks with India. The regional government has plans to develop border trade markets. The airport project in Falam is also moving ahead. Additionally, we are about to implement the Manipur hydropower project. I must say all these aviation, road and maritime projects will strengthen the connectivity for Chin State and improve the ease of doing business.What about the Chin diaspora? Do they have a role to play in building the state?The Chin diaspora remain at the level of remitting household income back to their family members in Chin State. Most of them are yet to access higher education, since those opportunities are not widely available in Myanmar. In other words, they are not millionaires or big investors who are able to contribute to the Chin economy or development. For example, some American-born Chinese who became big tycoons have invested back in China and are active in doing China-related businesses. But the Chin diaspora have not achieved that level of development yet. Thus, we are pushing the investors to come and invest first and make develop our region. Eventually, we can attract our Chin diaspora to come back when they have finished their higher education to help build our economy.What is your key message to investors?We need a lot of domestic investments as well as FDIs. We want investors to come and invest in the sectors where the community can be benefited alongside the investors. Investments in agribusinesses are also most welcome, especially since the investors can enjoy a first-mover advantage if they invest now.","/news/chin-build-infrastructure-links-investment.html"

However, the company had failed to consult or seek approval from the locals, said Ko Saw Thar Boe, one of the locals The Myanmar Times spoke to.                          Chit Lin Myaing Company, which is backed by the Chinese, had told affected villagers that it had received approval to commence production at the quarry and a mutual agreement had been signed with the local authorities in October.          According to the agreement, villagers at the affected areas will receive benefits of K2,000 for each quarry mined and that production will be carried out for 3 years. A total of 130,000 quarries will be mined in a year, said Ko Saw Thar Boe.However, he pointed that while “massive machines have already been set up at the quarries, no Environmental Impact Assessment had yet been conducted.” What’s more, warning gunshots were fired when locals ventured too close to the quarries with the intention of examining them, he said. The locals said the State government seemed to be turning a blind eye towards the project and have made no effort to initiate discussions with the affected villagers. As the stone quarrying activities to be conducted by Chit Lin Myaing Company constitutes a massive project, application must be made to Myanmar Investment Commission and the State government. However, an enquiry made to the MIC in Nay Pyi Taw revealed that the project had not been permitted, U Saw Thar Boe added.“I asked them for documentations, but they couldn’t provide them,” he said.As the highway is to be built from Kawkareik to Eindu, social and environmental assessments should be carried out on the construction process.However, project officials have yet to notify of provide an explanation of their intended activities. At Ka Maw Po village, situated near the stone production site, huge boulders have fallen near the vicinity of the houses. Meanwhile, village wells have collapsed, cracks have formed on houses and the machines are causing noise pollution.The project could also interfere with existing small-scale quarries at Lun Nya, which has been providing jobs to the locals since 2007. In fact, several companies have proposed large-scale industrial projects near the area since 2012 but they were all rejected or protested against. These include construction of a cement factory by an Indian company in 2012 and a separate attempt to start stone quarrying near Lun Nya in 2016.","/news/stone-mining-kayin-state-quarries-commence-without-mic-approval-necessary-assessments.html"

Compared to before though, trading on the Yangon Stock Exchange is trickling dry.                         Stocks in China tumbled last week too, with the Shanghai Composite Index dropping 0.5 percent, or 16.34 points, to 3,382.91 at the close of the week. The index declined 1.5pc across the week, which is the most for a five-day period since August. Shares worth CNY643.8 billion changed hands on China’s two exchanges,  with some 100 stocks tumbling by the daily cap of 10pc on November 17, according to Bloomberg.Investors were responding to an article by state media agency Xinhua, published after the market closed on November 16, which stated that the share price gain in alcohol maker Kweichow Moutai was too rapid and risky for value investors.That led to a slump in Kweichow Moutai’s shares as well as the shares of other listed liquor makers in China, as investors interpreted the move as a sign of regulatory tightening. Small-cap stocks, which are riskier than the bigger blue-chips like Kweichow Moutai, also took a hit.Slowing economy?          Even as its equities took a beating, yields on China’s 10-year sovereign bonds spiked last week, topping 4pc on November 14 for the first time in 3 years. During the week, the country also released economic data revealing that industrial output and retail sales had expanded slower than projected.While China's economic growth is still healthy at more than 6.5pc, it is nevertheless growing at its slowest pace in 26 years. This is because Beijing is in the process of moving its economy from dependence on manufacturing to being consumption driven.However, the country has been reluctant to curb its dependence on debt, which is responsible for fueling its growth. According to the International Monetary Fund, Chinese banking sector assets are now 310pc of GDP, up from 240pc at the end of 2012 and nearly three times the emerging market average.To stem its addiction to borrowing, the central bank has the option of raising borrowing rates. On the other hand, it risks destabilising an economy that is already slowing. “Authorities face a delicate balance between tightening financial sector policies and slowing economic growth,"" the IMF said in its report.Chinese FDIChina is also one of the largest investors in Myanmar. For the first six months of this fiscal year, approved foreign direct investments from China to Myanmar totaled $829 million. Will slower growth and an increasingly indebted corporate sector impact the pace of its overseas investments?Not quite, at least for now. Julian Wee, senior market strategist, Asia at the National Australia Bank said: “The rise in China’s bond yields are likely transitory. China’s ability to invest overseas is mainly underpinned by its structural current account surplus, which is a reflection of the high savings rate domestically.”“China’s interest in investing overseas is also an attempt to export its excess capacity in certain relevant areas like construction and steel production. That motivation will remain a key driver for investment policy for some time,” he said.","/news/myanmar-bourse-all-time-low-china-stocks-slip.html"

Wang told a news conference in Nay Pyi Taw that the first step is to have a ceasefire and restore order and stability in the area so people will stop running away and live in peace.          “In the second stage, all parties should encourage and support Myanmar and Bangladesh to strengthen exchanges, to find a way to solve this issue through consultation on the basis of equality,” The Associated Press quoted Wang as saying during the news conference.The third stage, he said, is for the international community to help develop Rakhine.“Rakhine state has rich resources but develops them inadequately,” Wang said. “We call on the international community to help the region get rid of poverty and increase investment. ... China is willing to help and play its part.”Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who met with Wang separately, expressed his gratitude to China for backing Myanmar on the Rakhine crisis. In a Tatmadaw statement posted on its official Facebook, it said Wang Yi asked the army chief to take action to stabilise the situation in Rakhine,  to help implement  regional development projects, and to accept ""Bengalis"" that have fled to Bangladesh within the bounds of Myanmar’s current laws.  Wang also gave suggestions to Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on how to explain to the international community the real situation in Rakhine. Wang and the commander-in-chief also discussed how to improve bilateral relations between their two countries through military cooperation, the Tatmadaw said.           china_2.jpg                For her part, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi hailed China’s continued support for Myanmar.“China and Myanmar are very much different in size and power, but when it comes to mutual understanding, the two countries are friends with the same values,” she said.During his visit to Dhaka on the weekend, Wang said China holds the view Rakhine issue can only be solved properly by the consultations between Bangladesh and Myanmar, and only by this way can the agreement be accepted by the parties concerned and be sustainable.The Northern Rakhine “issue is a complicated one touching on history, ethnicity and religion, among others, thus it calls for a comprehensive solution,” China’s state news agency Xinhua, quoted Wang as saying in a press briefing in Dhaka.Wang urged the international community including the United Nations should create a good atmosphere for the consultations between Bangladesh and Myanmar, Xinhua added.Aside from the Rakhine issue, Wang also discussed with the State Counsellor other bilateral issues, such as the Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to establish land and sea route that would link different Asian countries and Europe. They also got updates on the latest developments on China-funded projects such as the refurbishment project for the National Theater in Yangon, pilot project of poverty-reduction cooperation in Myanmar, and refurbishment project for the Thuwunna National Indoor Sports Stadium.Wang is the first high-ranking Chinese official to meet the government led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy since it was sworn in on March 30, 2016, ending more than half of a century of military domination.Wang was scheduled to attend the two-day the 13th Asia-Europe Foreign Ministers’ Meeting which will be held in Nay Pyi Taw starting today. – with reports from AP, Xinhua","/news/china-rolls-out-new-strategy-rakhine.html"
"61",61,"‘ASEAN way’ outweighs pitfalls",2017-11-17,"Opinion","In the 50th anniversary year of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the annual leaders’ summit displayed both the strength of the bloc’s all-or-none consensus model and areas where its limits could be addressed.                         As the leaders head home from Manila, the Rohingya refugee crisis in Myanmar looks no closer to a resolution, testing the limits of ASEAN’s ability to promote stability for the hundreds of millions of people who call its 10 member nations home.          But its fundamental principle – that any progress must be agreed by all parties – is more important than ever with the rise of China and confusion about the United States’ South East Asia policy, analysts say.Formed by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand in 1967 amid fears of the spread of communism, ASEAN took on Brunei in 1984, followed by Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia in the 1990s.It has mitigated conflict and overseen massive gross domestic product growth as a bloc, and now cooperates smoothly with dialogue partners on counterterrorism and humanitarian assistance.“ASEAN is an ideal model for the region – its vagueness is what keeps it together,” said Takashi Kawabata, chief Asia economist at Uzabase Asia Pacific in Singapore.“These countries are as different as it gets in terms of population, development level, type of government... Make the rules too strong and you risk having countries drop out, as seen in the European Union despite its members’ similarity,” Kawabata said.Without ASEAN, authoritarianism would still persist in countries in the region, but in a more isolated atmosphere, he said.But the consensus model and the principle of non-interference in other members’ domestic affairs has led ASEAN to cop flak for insufficiently addressing human rights issues among its members.Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar’s Rakhine State for neighbouring Bangladesh after attacks on security forces by armed insurgents in August prompted an outbreak of violence.“This issue will be incredibly challenging to resolve with the mechanisms ASEAN has,” Kawabata said.He said that in previous regional conflicts, like the insurgency in Indonesia’s Aceh Province and the fight for independence in East Timor, governments were at least willing to negotiate, while the Myanmar government refuses to even recognise the Rohingya as an ethnic group.Other human rights concerns include Prime Minister Hun Sen’s crackdown on the media in Cambodia and extrajudicial killings in Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s so-called war on drugs.To cope with complicated challenges, ASEAN could yet decide to modify its 2007 charter, said Blake Berger, a research associate at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.‘ASEAN Minus X’Under Article 21 of the charter, “ASEAN Minus X” can be applied to decisions on economic issues, allowing some members to press ahead on the basis that the rest will join when ready.“There’s no reason they could not extend this to political areas like the establishment of an ASEAN peacekeeping force... they could, between all 10 members, have a discussion and agree that some members go ahead while others don’t,” Berger said.Another option would be to empower the ASEAN Secretariat, which Berger called “underfunded, understaffed and underperforming.”At present, Article 30 of the Charter means the secretariat is funded equally by all members, despite their vastly different resources, and this could be altered to be based on GDP instead.But negotiating these changes to the Charter is still a way off, Berger said, with some members wary of the idea of a more robust secretariat.Despite its drawbacks, ASEAN must preserve its model of unity as it deals with the growing influence of China, which would find it easier to advance its own interests in the region if ASEAN were split, Uzabase’s Kawabata said.Increased Chinese attention and investment has legitimate benefits, particularly in the less developed Mekong region, but “commitments to political issues like the South China Sea come along with that,” Kawabata said. Beijing has active territorial disputes in the waters with some ASEAN members.The summit in Manila saw ASEAN and China agree to start talks on a code of conduct to ease tensions in the South China Sea, but China is said to be unwilling to make the code legally binding.China’s increased engagement in the region, centring on the Beijing-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and its “One Belt, One Road” cross-border infrastructure project, comes just as the US commitment to South East Asia shows signs of waning, despite reassurances from officials.US President Donald Trump opted to fly home rather than take part in the debate at the East Asia Summit on Tuesday, which brought together ASEAN and major regional powers.Since Trump’s inauguration in January, the administration still has not appointed an ambassador to ASEAN, nor has it named an assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs in the State Department.Whatever relationship Washington decides to have with ASEAN, its interests are undoubtedly deeply affected by the extent to which this consensus-driven bloc maintains stability while surrounded by giants.– Kyodo","/news/asean-way-outweighs-pitfalls.html"

"63",63,"Indian Ocean conflict must be avoided",2017-11-13,"Opinion","The Indian Ocean has always been a vital source of livelihood for millions of people across three continents. Naval powers in past centuries jostled for dominance, with the British acquiring supremacy through its effective use of its sea forces. World War II and decolonisation resulted in the end of British hegemony in the region, with the Indian Ocean’s strategic importance heightened by the onset of the Cold War. The end of the Cold War marked yet another shift – security ceased being a bilateral conflict and instead transitioned into a multifaceted arena.                         The Indian Ocean region is home to 51 coastal and landlocked states, the majority of which are former colonies. An estimated 80 percent of all seaborne trade passes through the area, but worryingly, the region has 42pc of the world’s current conflicts and some of the world’s most strategic chokepoints.          Despite not being a littoral state of the Indian Ocean, China has long relied on it as a crucial source of resources – an estimated 84pc of all of China’s energy requirements traverse through the ocean, with 30pc of its sea trade, or in excess of US$300 billion (K409.48 trillion), coming from it. More importantly, it plays a crucial part in the success of China’s One Belt One Road initiative. China has displayed its commitment to the initiative in the past few years most notably by the construction of Chinese-owned and operated ports in the Indian Ocean.The most significant projects in the ocean China has invested in are the deepwater port near Gwadar in Pakistan and the shipping centre in Hambantota. Gwadar Port is seen as a critical component of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative, which will cost an estimated $62 billion, and consist of the creation of special economic zones, railways, roadways and energy production outlets in Pakistan. CPEC, traversing the deprived Balochistan region, offers a huge opportunity for local people to prosper, despite critics saying that China is ‘carving’ into Pakistan. Sherbaz Khetran, research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, states that CPEC will be a game changer, linking China with Middle Eastern and European markets. For Balochistan in particular, CPEC would bring in much-needed development, creating job opportunities and expanding vocational education among young Pakistanis in the region. The initiative in Hambantota, Sri Lanka, begun in 2010, incurred massive production losses, which in turn prompted Chinese investment to swoop in with a $1.12 billion private-public partnership agreement.On the security front, China has increasingly ramped up its presence by frequently deploying naval ships in the Indian Ocean. A more noticeable course of action was the establishment of a Chinese military base in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa, which was significant due to Djibouti already hosting a US military base. Costing $590 million, the port’s main aims are, according to Beijing, providing logistics for China’s humanitarian aid missions in Somalia and Yemen. It should also be noted that China has long played a key role in anti-piracy efforts in the Indian Ocean.China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy has fuelled ‘naval nationalism’ domestically and within its subcontinent neighbour through these endeavours. It has also sought to maintain and deepen ties with Bangladesh and Myanmar by investing heavily in construction projects in both countries.China’s actions have drawn the concern of many in the region, most notably that of India. Nationalist analysts from the ruling BJP Party have called upon India to assert its authority in what it refers to as ‘India’s Ocean’. Beijing had previously stated how the Indian Ocean will not be India’s backyard. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has highlighted the ocean’s importance by stating that the region is ‘at the top of our policy priorities.’On the naval front, India has not been silent toward what it perceives as increasing Chinese ‘encroachment’ within the region. This signals India’s movement away from its traditional inhibitions when confronting China, actively making clear its intentions of what it defines as safeguarding its interests in the region.The strategy pursued by India includes reaching out to South East Asian states, with Modi recently visiting Myanmar in the wake of the country’s internal turmoil, and conducting tri-lateral naval exercises with the US and Japan in Malabar – with the 2017 edition being the first to boast the deployment of aircraft carriers by all three countries. India’s security strategy has also involved docking warships recently in the Philippines and Vietnam. Additionally, Modi has been active in promoting a quadrilateral security initiative with the Syechelles, Mauritius and the Maldives. Furthermore, India has been building its military capabilities, most noticeably with the deployment of P-8 surveillance aircraft across South East Asia and the Nicobar Islands, along with recently conducting a joint military exercise with Sri Lanka.The threat of the world’s two most populous nations coming into military conflict, however, is existential at best. The presence of nuclear weapons on both sides further deters any conflict from arising. In addition, the crux of Sino-Indian relations rests upon a paradox – the careful leveraging of restraint and limited engagement. However, uncertainty about China’s long-term motivation in the Indian Ocean is the biggest cause of India’s paranoia. Modi recently negotiated a $3 billion purchase of MQ-9 Guardian drones from General Atomics in the US to monitor China’s activities in the Indian Ocean. Thus, tactful diplomacy must be used to defuse this threat.The most important thing to keep in mind is that alienation will lead nowhere. This is especially true of India’s stance toward China – by alienating perceived ‘competition,’ it limits and can jeopardise any form of fruitful cooperative dialogue. While vying for naval supremacy, both countries happen to be critical economic partners – China is India’s largest trading partner, worth over $70 billion annually. Bringing in China as a cooperative partner is the most viable option, because it can simultaneously assert both India’s role in the region and address China’s concerns on maritime security.A more resounding message for a commitment to dialogue would be in tackling malicious non-state actors in the region. As mentioned, the Indian Ocean is home to much conflict, the most damaging being the persistent presence of piracy and terrorism.Since 2012, China and India have been part of the Shared Awareness and Deconfliction initiative, where, together with Japan, both countries participate in coordinating the movement of ships in the Gulf of Aden. Building trust among competing powers is a hard sell, but it must not be ignored. Therefore, region-building efforts through multilateral governing institutions must take place. The Indian Ocean Naval Symposium exists to facilitate communication and enhance transparency among naval forces in the region, yet this alone does not suffice. Effective region-building through institutions can leverage both countries’ desires to assume greater responsibility. Moreover, both countries stand to gain from strengthening ties and trust through multilateral organisations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the BRICS Development Bank. In conclusion, a careful balancing act must be made by both states for stability to be assured and maintained.Aung Zin Phyo Thein is a graduate in international relations from Durham University’s School of Government and International Affairs.","/news/indian-ocean-conflict-must-be-avoided.html"
"64",64,"China says will keep talking to Myanmar over stalled dam scheme",2017-11-09,"Business","China said on Wednesday it will continue to talk to Myanmar about a controversial stalled dam project, after Myanmar’s new energy minister cast doubt over the scheme.

Reuters reported in April that officials in China and Myanmar were discussing alternative options that would allow Myanmar to scrap the massive project amid environmental concerns.Big hydropower dams are not a priority in Myanmar’s strategy to tackle chronic power shortages, Energy Minister Win Khaing told Reuters on Tuesday.Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China’s position on the Myitsone dam had not changed, which was that China had always upheld deepening cooperation with Myanmar on a mutually beneficial basis.“The Myitsone hydropower station is a commercial cooperation project both sides have already agreed upon, and has already been through a complete approval process,” Hua told a daily news briefing.“We will continue to maintain communication with the Myanmar side and proactively and appropriately handle the problems or difficulties which arise during cooperation on the project, to allow relevant cooperation to continue to develop healthily and stably,” she added.The proposed dam, on the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwady river in Kachin state, would have sent most of its power across the border to China’s Yunnan province, which now has an oversupply of electricity as it switches to less energy-intensive industries amid an economic slowdown.A government panel set up in August 2016 was still reviewing the dam, Myanmar’s energy minister said, adding the government was in dialogue with the Chinese operator, State Power Investment Corp subsidiary Yunnan International Power Investment.","/news/china-says-will-keep-talking-myanmar-over-stalled-dam-scheme.html"

"66",66,"Vietnam aims to shine in APEC spotlight",2017-11-01,"Opinion","After more than three decades of economic reforms, Vietnam will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders’ Meeting in Danang on November 10-11. Given the rapidly changing world and this dynamic region, the summit has great significance in terms of economic and strategic matters.                         Vietnam, which has been preparing for this event for over two years, has four key objectives. First of all, amid the rise of populism and protectionism, the host must seize the moment with APEC leaders to make their cooperation more effective and efficient. In particular, the summit must embed the foundations for sustainable, inclusive and equitable global development.          Secondly, efforts must continue to reduce trade barriers and liberalise investment as APEC enters its fourth decade. This is a tall order because there are challenges in dealing with intellectual property rights, opening e-commerce and service liberalisation.Thirdly, to sustain economic growth, Vietnam must use this opportunity to increase bilateral trade, expand exports, and attract foreign investment. Vietnam, which has yet to be identified as a market economy, has one of the largest free-trade networks in ASEAN, with 16 free-trade arrangements.Finally, Danang is considered Vietnam’s most well-known port, which will be the showcase for future connectivity between South East Asia and the rest of the world. After a long period of anxiety over whether Vietnam is part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), it can positively be said that Hanoi is part and parcel of BRI, in addition to existing connectivity frameworks espoused by ASEAN and its dialogue partners.Beyond economic cooperation, the APEC summit provides a unique opportunity – during US President Donald Trump’s visit to Danang and Hanoi – for Vietnam to showcase the diplomatic finesse that has earned it international recognition. Trump is certain to make his feelings known on US trade and Asia policies.In the past few months, Trump has held talks with four key ASEAN members in Washington. Leaders from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore got strong pledges from Trump of continued US commitment to and engagement on trade and security. Initially, his “America First” policy rattled the region, as the US is still the biggest export market for ASEAN members.Washington has linked Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand to unfair trade practices because of high trade surpluses with the US. During their leaders’ visits, they pledged to invest more in the US and import more US goods, which could mean tens of thousands of jobs for Americans.In Danang, Trump will also have the chance to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders from 20 economies. According to Vietnam expert Professor Carlyle Thayer, this is an ideal situation for Hanoi, whose diplomats have always been adept at playing off the differences and convergences among the major powers. Now that Trump has decided to skip the November 14 East Asia Summit at Clark in the Philippines, the APEC platform and sidelines of the leaders’ meeting give added strategic value to the host.Vietnam will also use the APEC platform to push Washington to display a clearer position on trade and investment liberalisation. Since Trump became president, the US has sent mixed signals on how the world’s No. 1 economy will engage with other economies. For the region, Washington’s withdrawal from the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was a big blow to US free-trade policy and caused predictions of a protectionist trend. In fact, as the summit draws near, Washington has sent out messages that Trump wants fair trade to benefit everyone and that he is not anti-free trade or anti-globalisation.Truth be told, among all of the remaining signatories, Hanoi has suffered the most after the US pullout from the TPP, as it tries to reconcile a big imbalance between benefits and responsibilities in the modified agreement. It is understandable why Hanoi showed initial reluctance to support the so-called TPP 11, the modified trade deal being pursued by the 11 remaining nations in the TPP and being eagerly pushed by Japan, New Zealand and Australia.As APEC host, Vietnam has no choice but to support TPP 11 and has held several ministerial meetings to discuss its future. Indeed, Vietnam issued a joint statement on its commitment to continue with TPP 11 and leave open the possibility of the US returning to the trade accord.Hanoi will seek further commitment on the sidelines of APEC from the members of TPP 11 to continue the trade deal even without US participation. The success of APEC would further enhance Vietnam’s leading role at the ASEAN summit, which follows hot on its heels at Clark Freeport Zone. Already, Hanoi is preparing for its ASEAN chairmanship in 2020 to ensure that the group works in tangible ways to strengthen ASEAN centrality and external relations, as well as community-building by closing the gap between its old and new members.Kavi Chongkittavorn is editor-in-chief of The Myanmar Times.","/news/vietnam-aims-shine-apec-spotlight.html"
"67",67,"Myanmar’s northern powerhouse on the horizon",2017-10-30,"Mandalay & Upper Myanmar, Business","WITH more warehouses, better road networks, an improved power supply and enhanced human capital, Mandalay can become the country’s northern economic powerhouse after two years, according to the region’s chamber of commerce.                         Myanmar’s second largest city was the last royal capital and remains the hub of the country’s heartland. The city is fully embedded in the national agricultural economy, trade and logistics – with produce being transported from its vast hinterland to the city before being exported to Yunnan or abroad via Yangon.With Yangon increasingly crowded with foreign investments, Mandalay has naturally become the next focus. India and China have already stationed their consulates in the city, while European business chambers are establishing their presence as well.The Myanmar Times sat down with U Win Htay, vice chair of the Mandalay Region Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MRCCI) in Mandalay Hill Resort, to talk about the city’s economic growth, urbanisation, foreign investments as well as the Belt and Road Initiative.The vice chair said agriculture is the most important sector for the city as well as the fast-growing industry.“We have a lot of vacant land, those not yet cultivated. We produce watermelons and cucumbers, and boast the largest trade associations for beans.“Tourism is another developing sector, because the city, such as Mogok township, has a lot of heritage and attractions to offer,” he said, adding that the tourism growth is supported by an increase in both domestic and international travellers.“It is around 50-50 for domestic visitors and foreigners. We have seen more Westerners and also a lot of Chinese, many of whom come from Yunnan via Muse.DifficultiesMandalay’s challenges in economic development are prevalent in other states and regions – the lack of finance, insufficient human resources and the absence of proper infrastructure in terms of road networks and power supply.U Win Htay explained that the politics is an additional problem.“In terms of both the Union and Mandalay regional level, the National League for Democracy-led governments are facing a lot of administrative challenges. They cannot control all the departments and this is not going very smoothly for businesses. Some departments are still being run in the old way.“The economy is slowing down and growth is very slow or even stagnant for businesses,” he observed.From the point of view of traders, the government’s task of providing clear policies and creating a business-friendly environment remains to be done.          u-win-htay.jpg                “For example, if you want to obtain a permit from the Myanmar Investment Commission [MIC], you need to first sort out environmental and social impact assessments [EIAs, SIAs], to prove your land ownership and submit your business proposal together with recommendations and authorisation from relevant authorities. It takes at least 3-6 months to get a permit,” he complained, but praised the regional MIC as a step forward.The Japan International Cooperation Agency’s small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) loan programme has a favourable interest rate, yet the maximum loan amount of K5 billion is insufficient for individual businesses.U Win Htay is also worried about brain drain triggered by Yangon’s rapid growth and the job opportunities made available by that.“I am worried – yes – about the brain drain to Yangon. We don’t have many job opportunities here. Young people go to Yangon and abroad to work and make a living,” he said, preferring businesses to expand and create employment in Mandalay instead. The city needs more promotion, more investments and more jobs to spur growth.DevelopmentBut it’s not all bad news. The Myotha Industrial Park is up and running already despite the lack of infrastructure, whereas a cyber-city project will be implemented next year on a 10,000-acre site near Pyinoolwin. The vice chair suggested that electricity and road network will be in place in two years. The 285MW-gas powered plant in Myingyan, supported by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, will provide much-needed electricity for infrastructure development.Mandalay needs more investments for logistics facilities, such as more warehouses and trucks.- U Win Htay, Mandalay Region Chamber of Commerce and IndustryMore importantly, Mandalay’s future lies in being Myanmar’s northern economic powerhouse by developing the connectivity necessary to make it a competitive logistics hub.“As the heart of logistics, we are connected to the Chinese border via Muse as well as the Indian border.“The dry port developed by Kerry Logistics has already started operation in July,” he went on, adding that he had imported goods via Yangon port, transported them to Mandalay’s dry port by train and then moved them to Muse by truck.Additionally, the city will start developing its river port in the Ayewaddy River with support from a survey drafted by JICA.Both software and hardware are imperative for Mandalay to become the northern powerhouse, according to U Win Htay. The city needs more investments for logistics facilities, such as more warehouses and trucks. In terms of software, Mandalay has to develop its human capital, especially in training engineers, drivers, mechanics and other logistics-related vocational training. The region lacks the skills to turn raw materials into value-added products.Belt and RoadAdditionally, the vice chair said that China’s Belt and Road Initiative is beneficial and the city should take part. However, Mandalay ought to be careful about not losing its own culture and damaging the environment. The influence of Chinese cultures and changes to the city’s demographics are causes for anxiety. There is a case for preserving the culture, traditions and way of life of Mandalay in face of potentially rapid changes imposed externally. “The BRI will promote trade and tourism and bring in technical support, expertise, investments and human capital for Mandalay.“The Mandalay population is already dominated by ethnic Chinese … The Belt and Road Initiative may exacerbate this trend in terms of demographics. This is worrying. “Many people call Mandalay ‘Yunnan Mandalay’ because of the visible ethnic Chinese population. Many move from the border areas to the city, and some acquire a National Registration Card [NRC],” he noted, adding that some Chinese trade associations wield more influence than the MRCCI and, due to the background of Chinese businesses, they have more extensive interests which not many domestic companies can parallel. U Win Htay said that the primary concern for businesses regarding the Belt and Road Initiative is the immigration from China.“It’s hard to solve the problem. There are more immigrants from border areas. The immigration authorities should better enforce regulation in the border areas so Mandalay won’t be affected by the immigrants.”","/news/myanmars-northern-powerhouse-horizon.html"

The BRI is a huge project backed by the Chinese aimed at boosting trade and extending China’s economic influence across 68 countries spanning three continents – Asia, Europe and Africa.           “The BRI is a historic and powerful opportunity for everyone involved. Our bank has full confidence to take part as a financier in the project, which is also important for Myanmar’s economy development,” said Mr. He Bi Qing, the general manager of ICBC’s Yangon branch.Myanmar signed a cooperation agreement with the Chinese at the BRI Forum for International Cooperation held in China in May, 2017. “The Myanmar government has already agreed to cooperate in the project. In view of the goal between the two countries being economic development, we anticipated that Chinese financial companies will open their branches in Myanmar. We want to contribute to the Myanmar financial market and help in its development,” said Mr. Hong Laing.He said that cooperation in matters such as stock trading businesses, insurance business and nurturing skilled banking personnel in the direct monetary as well as foreign currency trade must be signed quickly between the two countries.Currently, the Chinese are also involved in negotiations over the proposed Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone, which consists of an industrial park and a $7.5 billion deep-sea port in Rakhine State.

"69",69,"EU weighs more sanctions on Myanmar",2017-10-17,"National News","If the government does not make improvement to the humanitarian situation in Rakhine state, the European Union will consider measures that would likely include economic embargo against Myanmar.                         The EU yesterday released a statement urging the Myanmar government to do more for conflict-affected Rakhine State.           Rakhine State is home to roughly one million Muslims who identify as Rohingyas, a term government does not recognise.“The Council may consider additional measures if the situation does not improve, but also stands ready to respond accordingly to positive developments,” the statement said.Since the August 25 attacks on Myanmar security outposts by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army and in the aftermath of counter-operations by government security forces, about 550,000 Muslims have fled into neighboring Bangladesh.Rakhine State also suffered waves of violence since inter-communal unrest erupted in 2012.  Since then, hundreds of thousands in the Muslim community fled from conflict areas and were kept in cramped camps under miserable conditions. The ethnic Rakhine community has also been affected by the conflict.The EU statement came after State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi announced on October 12, a roadmap of top three priorities for resolving the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine. These included the repatriation of refugees who fled to Bangladesh and providing humanitarian assistance effectively; resettlement and rehabilitation of the communities affected by the conflicts; and jumpstart development in the region to bring about durable peace.The State Counsellor also introduced Union Enterprise for Humanitarian Assistance, Resettlement and Development in Rakhine, a mechanism led by her as chairperson where domestic organisations as well as the international community can cooperate in helping Rakhine.The EU said it “will suspend invitations” to senior military officials including the Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar armed forces, while reviewing all practical defense cooperation, which were decided in response to the disproportionate use of force by government in carrying out clearance operations in Rakhine  where several allegations of human rights violations emerged but denied by government.“The EU confirms the relevance of the current EU restrictive measures which consist of an embargo on arms and on equipment that can be used for internal repression,” it said in the statement.The bloc of European nations also stressed that “credible allegations of serious human rights violations and abuses such as brutal attacks on children, must be thoroughly investigated. The EU urges Myanmar to fully cooperate with the Human Rights Council’s independent fact-finding mission and allows it to visit Rakhine State.”It also encouraged Myanmar to hold a “dialogue with its neighbouring countries, in particular Bangladesh” in seeking common solution for the repatriation of the refugees currently residing in the territory of Bangladesh.In addition, the EU called on the government to restore access for delivery of humanitarian assistance to the communities in Kachin and Shan states affected by the ongoing armed conflicts.The government and ethnic armed organisations have engaged in active military hostilities. An estimated 100,000 internally displaced people are suffering consequences of internal armed conflicts.The EU also said it would hold a “constructive dialogue” with the Myanmar government at the upcoming ASEM Foreign Ministerial Meeting in Nay Pyi Taw next month.Meanwhile, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi met with Special Envoy for Asian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China Sun Guoxiang in Nay Pyi Taw yesterday. A statement released by government said they discussed matters related to bilateral cooperation between Myanmar and China and exchanged views on Myanmar’s peace process.China has expressed interest in helping the humanitarian crisis in northern part of Rakhine of Myanmar that borders with Bangladesh. For instance, in April this year, Sun Guoxiang urged Bangladeshi authority to resolve the crisis with Myanmar bilaterally and said China was willing to help.China has often insisted the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine is an internal affair of Myanmar, which should not be intervened. In March this year, China, along with Russia blocked a UN Security Council statement to discuss the situation in northern Rakhine.An opinion piece published at Global Times, a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist party, on Sunday stated that China and India should help Myanmar resolve the humanitarian crisis as it is important for both countries’ grand projects.Myanmar plays “a unique role” in Beijing-led Belt and Road Initiative, with China’s total investment in Myanmar reaching US$18.53 billion in January of 2017, the piece argued. Similarly, Myanmar is also a “gateway for New Delhi’s northeastern states to Southeast Asia” in pursuing its Act East policy, it said.“Unlike the way the Western media would have it, Myanmar is not a new battleground. “In fact, it is a new opportunity,” the Global Times said.EURakhine","/news/eu-weighs-more-sanctions-myanmar.html"
"70",70,"Frustration mounts as Kyaukphyu port negotiations stall",2017-10-16,"Business","Kyaukphyu’s Chinese investors have hit back at criticisms over their majority stake in a proposed deep-sea port in Rakhine. They emphasised that it was the Myanmar government who drew up the shareholder structure and that the ball is in Nay Pyi Taw's court to break the inertia and move the negotiations forward.                         Kyaukphyu is the location for a proposed Special Economic Zone (SEZ) which consists of an industrial park and a deep-sea port in Rakhine State. This mega project was dubbed as the ""mini Singapore"" by the Financial Times. In 2015, a consortium led by CITIC the won bid to develop both the port and the park. The consortium includes China Harbor Engineering, China Merchants, TEDA Investment, Yunnan Construction Engineering Group and Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group. Consulted by Singapore Jurong and PwC, the consortium took part in the bidding and won the tender. Under the shareholder structure permitted by the government under U Thein Sein, China is to have an 85 percent stake in the deep-sea port, with Myanmar holding the remaining 15pc.           There seems to be a misconception that we, CITIC, are being greedy to ask for 85pc, but it was originally, clearly written. - Warren Hua, CITICThe Chinese consortium, led by Chinese state-owned CITIC Group, is currently in negotiations with Nay Pyi Taw on the framework agreements of both components of the SEZ – the industrial park and the deep-sea port. In an exclusive interview on October 12, Yuan Shaobin, executive president of CITIC Myanmar, expressed frustration over the negotiations, telling The Myanmar Times that talks have been ongoing for two years with little progress. “The agreement for the framework is nearly ready, it just needs some progress to be approved,” he said.But Mr Yuan stressed that the framework agreement merely serves as a small step forward and is not the target. The ultimate aim is to sign all the transaction documents which will enable work at the SEZ to commence. The industrial park involves three agreements: a investment agreement, a shareholder agreement, and a land lease agreement, while the port requires the same agreements together with an additional concession agreement. “We need some more time for more details to be discussed and negotiated. And now this hasn’t yet started. We don’t know when we can start negotiating these kinds of agreement. We have prepared all the drafts of the agreements according to the world’s best practices, but we still need feedback [from Myanmar] to revise and modify the agreement clause by clause. This is the current situation,” he said.Warren Hua, legal advisor to CITIC Construction added that, on top of those deals, ancillary documents and financing documents will need to be ironed out as well.Delay after delayIn August, Dr Oo Maung, vice-chair of Kyaukphyu SEZ Management Committee, told The Myanmar Times that the equity shares and details between CITIC consortium and Myanmar Kyaukphyu SEZ Holding Company (MKSHC consortium) was being negotiated and he expected an agreement to be signed within that month. It is now October and negotiations have come to naught. “The negotiations and all the relevant works are going forward so slowly,” Mr Yuan said.He added that even if the transaction documents are signed now, the investors cannot commence the project immediately because it would take at least 1.5 years to complete the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process and for the EIA to be approved.Mr Yuan now estimates that the project could only start after two years following the ratification of transaction agreements. “We are ready to sign. Anytime Myanmar is ready, we are ready,” he said, making clear their frustration over the lack of progress and indicated that the ball is in the government's court to end the inertia and get on with the work.New demandsSo what is causing the delays? The disagreement between the two sides concerns the Myanmar consortium’s new demands to raise its stake to 30pc as well as receive dividends but to not shoulder financing responsibility. The request for proposal (RFP) for the SEZ was first drafted in 2014, when the former government instructed that “the bidder shall hold a stake of not more than 85pc, while the Myanmar government and government designated entity shall hold a stake of not less than 15pc.” “The Myanmar consortium just wants more shares but they don’t want to take more financing responsibility,” Mr Yuan noted, adding that negotiations on resolving this issue is taking time.He stressed that the CITIC consortium has already paid a very attractive price for participation in the Kyaukphyu SEZ. “We gave a very, very high price for the land and concession rights. The Myanmar side just needs to pay the equity – 15pc of the first phase of the deep-sea port – and does not need to consider further financing responsibilities [in the next three phases],” Mr Yuan said. The next three phases will be funded by the revenue generated by the first phase and loans from CITIC with an interest rate of 1.5 percent per annum.CITIC emphasised that the total investment cost of the port project, covering all four phases, would amount to US$7.2 billion, whereas the Myanmar side will only need to contribute $74 million.“The Myanmar side would also have 15pc of the dividends,” Mr Hua added. Mr Yuan said that the Myanmar government thinks the offer from CITIC is good and “they want to get more shares but they don’t want to [make any financing responsibilities]. If they want more shares, CITIC cannot take on all the financing responsibilities. It should be shifted proportionately.”“We have agreed that Myanmar’s side can have 30pc shares. But the additional shares – the shift from 15pc – means that they should take on some of the financing responsibilities from CITIC proportionately.”The way he sees it, “Myanmar should take the same risk as us. We should have Myanmar partners who would be willing to take on the same risk with us. It’s business.”“There seems to be a misconception that we, CITIC, are being greedy to ask for 85pc, but it was originally and clearly written that Myanmar’s side only required. We have been fully responding to the requirements and conditions. It is not us who wanted to have more shares than we are allowed to have! So, this should be clearly clarified,” Mr Hua highlighted. “Typically, for a project finance deal like this, 30pc will be consisting of equity and 70pc will be debt. So, we are actually bearing the largest chunk of the financing responsibility,” he explained. Justifying the stakeBut how is it politically justifiable for a foreign state-owned company to own a majority stake in a deep-sea port in another country?We had no intention to have the majority share in the beginning. It had been requested by the Myanmar government because it is not only just about the shares, it is [about] the investment. - Yuan Shaobin, CITIC“Of course, we know that Myanmar – at its current stage and compared to its surrounding countries – has the potential for development. That is why we committed an investment during that period. “Another point to make is considering China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Myanmar is a critical point. If we invest here, we could request more support from the government to do more business,” Mr Yuan said, adding that the project is helpful for developing Myanmar’s economy. But since the transfer of political leadership and change in government, “nobody [from the Myanmar government] cared about this [Kyaukphyu project], thought about this or about how to deal with this,” according to CITIC.The Chinese state-owned bank said that they are  unclear when an agreement will be reached and inked.Special Economic Zone","/news/frustration-mounts-kyaukphyu-port-negotiations-stall.html"

China’s capital control on outbound investments is primarily targeted at sectors such as real estate, entertainment and sports,” Mr Seet noted.The BRI focuses on strategic infrastructure projects to bridge the infrastructure gaps and stimulate economic growth in countries involved in the scheme, according to the PwC director. “We are beginning to see a gradual increase in China outbound activities in recent months. It has been reported that the value of Chinese overseas M&A deals jumped in the third quarter following several large transactions and many of the deals tied to the BRI. “I am hoping that the capital restriction can turn out to be a positive thing for Myanmar, as it potentially directs more attention and financial discipline into the much-needed infrastructure sectors in Myanmar,” he added.Hilary Lau, a corporate and commercial lawyer and partner at the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills echoed a similar view: the restrictions on overseas investments are meant to limit only certain industries such as hospitality and entertainment. “Energy and infrastructure transaction are still encouraged by the Chinese government. Belt and Road projects are also encouraged by the government and are policy-driven. Hence, I don’t think the crackdown will have much impact on Belt and Road transactions or projects,” Mr Lau explained. Resorts, hospitality and entertainment sectors may “slow a bit” but other areas which are encouraged will continue to go ahead.The Belt and Road countries should continue to be hot areas for investment because Chinese government is clearly pushing forward BRI investments. - Hilary Lau, Herbert Smith FreehillsSome countries will be more affected than others, depending on the sectors in which Chinese investments have been targeted. For those affected, PwC observed that M&A transactions have already slowed and Chinese investors have become “more cautious and less bullish”. Investors are now looking to China’s 19th Party Congress this month for the government’s policy regarding outbound investment. Thomson Reuters data revealed that Chinese acquisitions in the 68 countries officially linked to the BRI totalled US$33 billion as of August 14, surpassing the $31 billion tally for all of 2016. Asia saw the biggest increase in deals out of all the regions, with an overall number of M&A the second highest, after Europe.","/news/belt-and-road-shields-myanmar-beijings-capital-crackdown.html"
"72",72,"China reinforces mediation call as refugee crisis spirals",2017-10-10,"National News","Without alienating Bangladesh, China is backing Myanmar, setting the stage of mediation between the two countries to resolve the Rohingya humanitarian and refugee crisis.                         On September 28, China flew 2,000 tents and 3,000 blankets as part of a 150 tonnes relief package for Rohingya refugees, fleeing the violence in Myanmar.          The Chinese stressed that they had flown in the supplies purely on humanitarian considerations, to help Bangladesh shoulder the burden of the sudden refugee surge. Politically, Beijing empathised with Myanmar, which had become a target of harsh criticism from the West, on the familiar grounds of violating human rights and engaging in “ethnic cleansing”.“The Chinese side is highly concerned about the difficulty facing Bangladesh in resettling the displaced people in the Myanmar-Bangladesh border area. In order to help the government of Bangladesh with the resettlement efforts, the Chinese government has decided to provide emergency humanitarian supplies to the government of Bangladesh,” said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang during a September 30 media briefing.But Beijing also ensured that Myanmar avoided harsh international sanctions, which the United Nations could impose. During the first debate in the UN Security Council on September 28, the Chinese side defended Myanmar, highlighting the context of the humanitarian crisis.China’s Deputy UN Ambassador Wu Haitao at the meeting highlighted that “the question of Rakhine state is rooted in a nexus of complex historical, ethnic and religious factor.”Myanmar’s Rakhine State is at the heart of the Rohingya crisis. On August 25, the Arakan Rohingya Salivation Army (ARSA), operating in the state, attacked 30 police posts, killing 84, with 54 going missing. The massive retaliation by the Myanmar armed forces triggered an exodus of 400,000 people, seeking sanctuaries in the Chittagong hill tracts of neighbouring Bangladesh.The Rakhine State is strategically vital for both China and India. The website The Irrawaddy from Myanmar is reporting that Beijing has been pushing for preferential access to the deep seaport of Kyaukphyu – part of its ambitious infrastructure investment plan to deepen its links with economies throughout Asia and beyond. China has plans to pitch in US$10 billion in the neighbouring Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone.Besides, it wants to establish a railway from the Bay of Bengal, linking Myanmar with its Yunnan Province, within the framework of its Belt and Road undertaking. India, on its part is developing the Sittwe port, the capital of Rakhine province, for providing port access to its landlocked Northeast.With the crisis escalating, China has reiterated its offer to mediate between Myanmar and Bangladesh. “China is willing to continue promoting peace talks in its own way, and hopes the international community can play a constructive role to ease the situation and promote dialogue,” China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi was quoted as saying.China’s offer to broker a resolution is not new. In April, Chinese Special Envoy for Asian Affairs Sun Guoxiang visited Bangladesh and offered to tackle a diplomatic row between Bangladesh and Myanmar over the flight of the Rohingya.“Stability in Rakhine state really matters,” said Fan Hongwei, a Myanmar affair expert at Xiamen University in eastern China’s Fujian province, as quoted by the South China Morning Post.“If the situation in Rakhine remains as bad as it is now, the future of all these projects would be really bleak,” he observed.Yet China’s efforts may not succeed without active behind-the -scenes support from Pakistan, another player that has been drawn into the Rohingya entanglement.Writing in the Asia Times, Bertil Lintner, a Myanmar specialist, underscores that ARSA’s leader, Ataullah abu Ammar Junjuni, also known as Hafiz Tohar, was born in Karachi and received madrassa education in Saudi Arabia.The group was also earlier known as Harakah al-Yaqin, or “the faith movement,” and only last year adopted its more ethnically oriented name. He adds that there are hundreds of thousands of first, second and third generation Rohingya living in Orangi, Korangi, Landhi and other impoverished suburbs of Karachi. “The areas where they live are long-time hotbeds of extremist activity, with some known to have been recruited to fight in the wars in Afghanistan,” the article claims.","/news/china-reinforces-mediation-call-refugee-crisis-spirals.html"
"73",73,"ASEAN’s largest packaging firm to start Thilawa operations next year",2017-10-09,"Business","Kian Joo Group, the largest packaging business in ASEAN, is investing in a packaging plant in the Thilawa Special Economic Zone (SEZ). Construction of the plant is expected to be complete by the first quarter of next year.                          Malaysia-based Kian Joo is one of the biggest can manufacturers within ASEAN, manufacturing a wide range of products and providing packaging services. The group has manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and Vietnam, with its international procurement and marketing centre in Singapore.          Kian Joo first expanded into Thilawa in early 2015. The company set up Kianjoo Can Myanmar (KJMM) and Boxpak Myanmar (BPMM) with an initial capital of US$16 million and $7.5 million respectively for the Thilawa project. The total investment cost is expected to amount to $75 million for KJMM and $38 million for BPMM. At a time of rising demand and promising growth prospects in Myanmar, KJMM will manufacture tin cans, aluminium cans, carry out original equipment manufacturing and packing of beverages and milk powder, while BPMM will produce carton boxes.  Thilawa advantageOoi Teck Huat, CFO of Kian Joo Can Factory (KJCF), cited ownership flexibility, locality, labour market and land lease as reasons for opting to set up its base in Thilawa.“We are also attracted by the fact that we are able to have 100 percent ownership of companies we set up and we are able to have lease industrial land for 50 years with an option to renew for another 25 years,” Ooi told The Myanmar Times during an interview at KJM Aluminium, one of the group’s manufacturing plants in the town of Nilai, which is located in the state of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.Mr Ooi added that the tax incentives and labour market in Thilawa are attractive. Geographically, the SEZ is close to the port, which is important for the business because most of the raw materials have to be imported. Thilawa is managed by a one-stop service centre which is located in the SEZ, and which is “extremely helpful” in cutting the red tape for investors.Importantly, language is not a barrier in Thilawa because “most of the Myanmar citizens can speak English, with some able to communicate in Chinese,” said Mr Ooi.Existing challengesWhile he was confident with the “ability and professionalism of the Thilawa SEZ Management Committee”, Mr Ooi stressed that the SEZ is “still developing the infrastructure necessary for the success for company like ours.”The biggest difficulty is the inconsistency of power supply in the SEZ. “There [are still] frequent electricity outages and power tripping, fluctuations in voltage, even in Yangon itself. This outage includes both accidental outage and planned shutdown for sub-station maintenance. The outage may be a few minutes to 8-10 hours, based on the data obtained,” Mr Ooi said.The manufacturer is hopeful that the outage will be minimised soon, with a new 50MW natural gas-fired power plant in Thilawa almost up and running and another one, with 106MW, in Thaketa expected to commission in the first quarter of next year.Other challenges include poor road network and telecommunications infrastructure. “The road transportation system and infrastructure needs to be improved to enhance connectivity within Myanmar and to ensure manufacturers like us are able to deliver our goods to our customers or to the port without much hassle.“Telecommunication system is also vital to ensure connectivity with outside world,” he stated. Most of the roads are not in good condition and have potholes, road leading to various industrial zones in Yangon Region are also poorly maintained. This “bumpy road condition” will cause damages to fragile goods during transportation, according to the packaging giant.Another issue is the capacity of the ports. In Myanmar, “95pc of cargoes are handled by Yangon and Thilawa ports which are located along the river, where navigation is restricted to high tide and daylight hours. Goods have to be transferred to smaller vessels as larger vessels could not berth at these ports, leading to higher shipping costs.”KJCF is the second Malaysia-based investor to join Thilawa after YTL Corporation, which is building a cement plant in the SEZ. ASEANSpecial Economic Zone","/news/aseans-largest-packaging-firm-start-thilawa-operations-next-year.html"
"74",74,"Taiwanese firm to set up feed mills, poultry plants in Myanmar",2017-10-05,"Business","An agri-food giant in Taiwan is to invest in mills and poultry plants in Myanmar as part of the company’s corporate strategy to cement its expansion in ASEAN.                         Taiwan-based agriculture and food conglomerate DaChan Great Wall Group announced on October 2 a US$30 million joint venture with Myanmar firm Myint Investment Group. DaChan will hold 51 percent stake in the JV while the Myanmar counterpart will own 49pc.The joint venture will set up feed mills for livestock and fishers as well as poultry plants to produce chickens and eggs. The entire project is expected to reach completion by the end of 2018. The first poultry plant in Myanmar is expected to begin operations by the end of next year at the earliest, the Taipei Times reported.DaChan chair Charles Han told the Taiwan newspaper that his group seeks to develop an integrated supply chain of poultry products in Myanmar by replicating its success in other ASEAN countries. The conglomerate began its expansion into Southeast Asia in the 1990s. Its Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, DaChan Food Asia, operates its Vietnamese business.This year marks the 60th anniversary of the Taiwanese company, which seeks to expand its involvement in the ASEAN region in the next decade.DaChan Great Wall also said it is tapping into more overseas markets through collaborations with Tokyo-headquartered Showa Sangyo, according to Taiwanese media reports. The Japanese firm provides a wide spectrum of food processing products, including wheat flour, vegetable oils and commercial-use premixes. The two companies have been operating together in the Chinese market for more than 15 years, with several plants producing premix powders in Shanghai and Tianjin.Taiwan, under its leader Tsai Ing-wen, has prioritised economic ties with ASEAN to revive the island’s economy. Ms Tsai’s “New Southbound” initiative is a five-year plan covering industrial and agricultural exchanges, aiming to support Taiwanese businesses to capitalise on the ASEAN market and reduce economic reliance on the mainland. As of November 2016, foreign direct investment by Taiwanese companies into the six largest ASEAN economies doubled in the past five years, according to Singapore-based DBS Group.","/news/taiwanese-firm-set-feed-mills-poultry-plants-myanmar.html"
"75",75,"Belt and Road dispute resolution: options for Myanmar",2017-10-03,"Business","SINGAPORE is active in Thilawa Special Economic Zone (SEZ) as the dispute resolution centre, while London is stepping up its game in legal services in Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). When it comes to infrastructure disputes, Myanmar has a few choices to consider.Some businesses in China seeking to expand their operations beyond domestic borders and to export their products and services internationally have greatly underestimated the legal risks in the process, according to Dr Ying Yu from Oxford. The success of the initiative depends not only on bilateral agreements but also on multilateral agreements between countries, so as to form a comprehensive legal framework within which these countries can operate.Contract disputes are inevitably a risk in large-scale infrastructure projects between jurisdictions which are at different stages of development and legal maturity.Professor Teresa Cheng, senior counsel and chair of Asian Academy of International Law, spoke to The Myanmar Times at a sideline interview during the Belt and Road Summit. Jointly organised by Hong Kong’s government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), the summit was held on September 11 in the city.Professor Cheng argued that the legal structures in many individual member-states within ASEAN are sufficiently advanced to allow the level of international collaboration necessitated by the BRI. The law exists in practice and the task is how to implement the law in individual business cases.“Now a lot of the projects might be China’s money investing into some of the countries, and the platform would be to use Hong Kong for financing or forming the company and so on,” she said, adding that fairness in the legal system is an important consideration for ASEAN and Myanmar.Singapore, London and Hong Kong are all positioning themselves as the legal platforms for BRI projects.“Hong Kong transactional lawyers are very experienced in transactions involving Chinese parties as well. So if there’s a Chinese investment going into one of the Belt and Road stakes, Hong Kong has had many experiences that has dealt with companies based in China – investing outbound investments.“The other thing then is that Chinese companies, being advised by Hong Kong-based law firms, will have the benefit of being able to communicate with Chinese lawyers,” she noted.When a dispute arises in a BRI-related project in Myanmar, there are four criteria for choosing a dispute resolution centre, according to the barrister. Firstly, if the two parties have to resolve a dispute, they don’t want to go into Myanmar or mainland China. Geographically, it doesn’t make sense for these two Asian countries, Myanmar and China, to run to the rest of the world. Secondly, the bilingual proficiency of the Hong Kong system allows disputes to be managed in both languages.“Thirdly, Hong Kong has been ranked number 3 and 4 in the past two years by the World Economic Forum’s global competitiveness report for judicial independence. In terms of rule of law -- the World Bank has published a report [October 2016] looking at the past 20 years of how various states behaved in a number of initiatives – Hong Kong’s rule of law position in the world moved from somewhere around 60 to number 12. Therefore the judiciary and legal system are solid,” Ms Cheng observed, adding that the arbitration culture in the city is also very strong.The Myanmar Times asked the chair of Asian Academy of International Law why Singapore and Japan are ahead in terms of arbitration in Thilawa Special Economic Zone. She conceded that the city has been “a bit slower” than the other two, but “it doesn’t mean that it isn’t going there – they have set up a Hong Kong-Myanmar tourism board that promotes the two jurisdictions in terms of tourism and commerce.”In May, the Asian Academy of International Law has provided training for Asian judges on New York Convention (The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards). Last month, the organization undertook another capacity-building exercise with a number of Asian and African government officials mainly from the foreign affair ministries. The capacity-building focused on public-private partnerships (PPP) and encouraged government to explore PPPs.“With Myanmar, in particular, I have been told that there have been visits from government officials here, such as the one two months ago, to attend trainings. There is a long-term relationship with most places. There’s always capacity-building, collaboration – a more long-term relationship which is [a core part of] the ethics and culture of Hong Kong businessmen,” she explained.Professor Cheng is confident that international investors can structure the joint venture and use legal services in Hong Kong to provide advice, separately, to the Myanmar and Chinese party. The deal can be structured and financed through the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) or the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) established by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.","/news/belt-and-road-dispute-resolution-options-myanmar.html"
"76",76,"Ajinomoto concerned with counterfeit ",2017-10-02,"Business","IT is risky for Ajinomoto to expand into Myanmar because there are a lot of counterfeit food products in the domestic market, which might damage the company’s brand image, according to Takaaki Nishii, president and chief executive officer of Ajinomoto.          Tokyo-headquartered Ajinomoto is a Japanese food and chemical corporation which produces seasonings, cooking oils, TV dinners, sweeteners, amino acids, and pharmaceuticals. Ajinomoto is the trade name for the company’s original monosodium glutamate (MSG) product.In February 2016, Ajinomoto built a plant in Thilawa’s Special Economist Zone (SEZ) which packages and distributes its seasonings in Myanmar. The factory’s opening ceremony was held on September 19 last year.“Within Myanmar’s market, there are imitation-seasoning powders that have been widely circulated using the ‘Ajinomoto’ brand. These fake products will utilise contaminated and low-quality ingredients. And because they are within the market, they are greatly damaging our company’s image. This matter cannot be handled solely by our company, and we hope that we can also get assistance from the Myanmar government, so that we can work together,” said Mr Nishii noted.Currently, the company has invested US$45 million for the construction of a factory in Thilawa SEZ, and it has been packaging and selling Ajinomoto seasonings. The factory imports raw products from Thailand and packages the ingredients in Myanmar. Ajinomoto had penetrated into Myanmar’s market in 1930 by directly importing the products from Japan. Later on, direct importation was halted and the company re-entered in 2017 in the form of a direct investment.The firm’s managing director Satashi Ogawa explained that upon re-entering Myanmar’s market, they undertook a market study. The study concluded that fake seasoning power and other adulterants are being sold on the market, under the fraudulent label of Ajinomoto products.“We have seen lots of products in the market including low-quality seasoning powers and products labelled with the ‘Ajinomoto’ trade mark. After doing more studies, we have found that the origin of this fake seasoning power is non-labelled big packages which come from China. The fake seasoning powder is packed into sachets labelled with the ‘Ajinomoto’ trade mark and then resold on the market. That’s why, all we can do is to have our marketing department staff go directly to the shops and show shop owners how to differentiate between fake and real,” Mr Ogawa said.Ajinomoto products produced in Myanmar display the trade mark, qualifications and ingredient written in Japanese on packages. The latter also inform of the number of ‘Ajinomoto’ factories in the world and their locations, said Mr Ogawa. “If the indications are in Chinese language, then it is artificial. That is an obvious way to find out whether the product is real or not,” he explained.Other artificial ingredients and commodities are being imported to Myanmar, apart from fraudulent seasoning powder. Goods failing to notify of standard limitations can also be found on the market. Myanmar does not yet have proper intellectual property law or organization to regulate quality standards. As a result, most of the original producing companies sustain heavy damages.Although the Ajinomoto factory in Thilawa SEZ only produces MSG, it plans to produce chicken seasoning powder under the brand name “RosDee”, while a subsidiary company, which is also located in the SEZ, will produce instant coffee powder, according to Mr Nishii.","/news/ajinomoto-concerned-counterfeit.html"
"77",77,"Rohingyas, Belt and Road, Kaladan – the future of Rakhine’s economy",2017-09-29,"Business","THE economy in the resource-rich Rakhine State is throttled by the crisis as well as the accompanying international backlash, dashing any hope of massive foreign investment in the near future. In the meantime, local communities in Kyaukphyu have demanded the stake ratio of the proposed Kyaukphyu port to be restructured so as to allow a higher ratio for Myanmar. Nay Pyi Taw is negotiating with the stakeholders on adjusting the ownership percentage between the two consortiums.          Despite the fact that Rakhine is not in Myanmar’s heartland geographically, the state is crucial for the country’s economy. In addition to the renowned Ngapali beach, Rakhine State holds enormous economic potential because the state has oil, natural gas fields and maritime resources from the Bay of Bengal.However, Rakhine remains the second poorest region or state in the country. Community and economic development are lagging behind, despite the prospect of several mega infrastructure projects, namely the Kyaukphyu project and the Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project.Crisis and challengeFollowing the recent attacks in August, the government’s information ministry has failed to effectively convey accurate information to the international community. Misinformation persisted until State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi attempted to clarify the situation in a speech on September 19.Nonetheless, international pressure has escalated. This enormous pressure poses a challenge to the region’s economy, according to U Oo Than Naing, MP from Yethetaung township in Rakhine State.Out of all foreign investment in Myanmar, Western countries only amount to less than 10pc, according to the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA). They contribute little to the development of Myanmar and to supporting democratic values, U Oo Than Naing added.We, Rakhine citizens, are starving despite the fact that we have many natural resources. We want to escape away from that sort of life. We want the economy to improve. We want foreign investment to come to our region. - U Oo Than Naing, Regional MPThis year, the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) issued licenses to two companies to build the station for supporting oil and natural gas in the Bay of Bengal with the permission of the state government and the Ministry of Electricity and Energy. U Khin Maung Nyo, freelance economic columnist, is concerned that the international pressure on Rakhine State may worry foreign investors about the area’s stability, which can hinder the economic prospects of Rakhine.“The instability is not just in Rakhine State, it is slowing down investment and decisions in the whole country. Due to the impact of the media on the issue, some foreign tourism agencies believe that the instability is only limited to Rakhine, but others believe it is affecting the entire country. “In any case, Rakhine tourism suffered from the change in the perception of foreigners,” he said. From the current situation, there doesn’t seem to be signs of economic sanctions on Myanmar, so the situation will not be worsening, said U Khin Maung Nyo. The current conflict in Rakhine State is mostly limited to the Maungdaw region in the northern part of Rakhine. The relevant government authorities and state government have been doing their best to stabilise the region. At the moment, Rakhine State’s economy has stagnated. Local citizens in Rakhine State either earn a living by fishing at sea (30pc of the population do so), or do businesses related to agriculture (70pc do so). Although rice is a staple crop, farmers are facing difficulties as they cannot extract a good price. Because of the instability, fishermen cannot go at sea, pushing them toward unemployment.In this view, the regional unrest also affected the seafood factories in Maungdaw region in terms of reduced production, according to Rakhine State Fisheries Department Director Dr Nyunt Wai Maung.“Our Rakhine State’s economic is much reduced. We have many natural resources on sea and land. We also have mountains. We, Rakhine citizens, are starving despite the fact that we have many natural resources,” U Oo Than Naing, a regional lawmaker, told The Myanmar Times.“We want to escape away from that sort of life. We want the economy to improve. We want foreign investment to come to our region. We want them to learn about our region’s real situation and to pass the message. We want only investments which will benefit our country. We don’t want investment which does nothing for us,” he added.Kyaukphyu’s grand schemeChina’s Kyaukphyu deep-sea port and Special Economic Zone (SEZ), which started under U Thein Sein’s government, are currently being developed in Rakhine State. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi signed up to the China-led Belt and Road Initiative when she visited Beijing in May.The Kyaukphyu project, which consists of both the port and the SEZ, is seen as a core part of the Belt and Road Initiative.An MoU is expected to be signed between Chinese state-owned CITIC - which won the tender of the project: to establish the port and the SEZ - and the state government. The developments of Kyaukphyu region will be shaped by these two projects, explained U Kyaw Aye Thein, Rakhine State planning and finance minister.          eth-rakhine-oil-cleanup.jpg                Local communities observed that Rakhine State economy is in a difficult position to develop. There has not been any formal agreement between the two parties so far, suggesting that there are many differences to be bridged before an agreement can be reached. Under U Thein Sein’s government, CITIC was contracted to implement the projects with the condition that the Chinese consortium will invest up to 85 percent in the strategic port and will carry all the financing responsibilities. This was not well received by the locals, U Oo Than Naing said.As a result, the National League for Democracy-led government is currently working on a change in the ownership percentage between the two consortiums.Local communities have expressed their desire that Kyaukphyu SEZ is structured in the same way as Thilawa SEZ – Myanmar owns 51pc while Japan owns 49pc. Additionally, there are concerns about land compensation, which has not been planned, a local resident said.“Rakhine State government welcomes companies which carry out transparent investments and beneficial investments to invest in the region. “Under the current arrangements for the Kyaukphyu project, investors are taking the lion’s share by cooperating with the government,” said U Thein Naing, MP of Rathedaung township.Although the Kyaukphyu SEZ is considerably larger than Thilawa SEZ, the current arrangement is one-sided so it does not sufficiently benefit the region and local economy. On the other hand, better synergy with local communities could hasten the realisation of the project, the regional lawmaker noted.Why can’t the government disclose the Kyaukphyu project details with transparency? The union government is taking the lead on this but the Rakhine State parliament was not updated with all the information. - U Oo Than Naing, Regional MPKaladan multi-modal transit transport The Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project is supported by a full grant from India. Sittwe jetty and Paletwa marine terminal have already been completed. When the jetty operates, bilateral trade will improve. In its wake, the development of agriculture, livestock and SME will follow.“The downturn in regional investment will not worsen, thanks to projects such as Kyaukpyu SEZ and Kaladan project. Chinese investment and trade are important for Myanmar, and relations with India is good as they side with us,” an economic expert said.The US and other Western countries do not have much investment in Myanmar. Investment agreements between Myanmar and the EU are not yet signed. Only once the investment protection agreement is signed will they invest more in Myanmar. Irrelevant of the Rakhine issue, EU investment will not come in en masse. It will take time for regional development projects to take shape, economic observers said.Tourism and promotionRakhine has a long coastal line well suited for regional tourism. Ngapali beach in Rakhine State ranks as the 8th best beach in the world, according to CNN 2016 rating. During tourism season, the coast host many visitors with insufficient hotels. The state government plans to expand the resort area. Along these lines, Kan Thar Yar beach in Gwa township is currently being developed.A circular road along the beach from Gwa to Ayeyarwady Region was agreed by Rakhine State and Ayeyarwady Region governments this year to strengthen economic cooperation. It aims to develop tourism development, electrification, and trade from Ayeyarwady to Maungdaw trade zone and international market via Sittwe jetty. “If resources in Rakhine are exploited, Rakhine economy will develop a lot, we hope. There are some beaches on a path from Gwa to Ayeyarwady. But due to the difficulty in transportation, those areas are not developed. We agreed to provide electricity on Gwa,” Rakhine State planning and finance minister U Kyaw Aye Thein said.There are many prospects for Rakhine’s development following hotel upgrades in Ngapali and Thandwe, he said.A delegation led by the tourism Union Minister U Ohn Maung will attend a photo tourism promotion in Japan to attract tourists in Rakhine State, Kayah State, Chin State and Tanintharyi Region. The state government is also planning to hold an investment forum targeting international investors next year.“We are planning to hold an investment forum to show that only a part of Rakhine is unstable and the remaining majority area is peaceful,” he added.Foreign investment in Ngapali hotels creates job opportunities for local people and a certain percentage of the tax revenue from the region is being allocated by the Union Government to the state government.More investment into the region would create more job opportunities and foster economic prosperity and hence stability, numerous government officials and local businessmen emphasised.","/news/rohingyas-belt-and-road-kaladan-future-rakhines-economy.html"
"78",78,"Sino-ASEAN arbitration panel proposed to tackle Belt and Road disputes",2017-09-28,"Business","THE head of Brunei’s arbitration association called for a panel of ASEAN and Chinese arbitrators to be established in order to create a dispute-resolution system which covers private companies involved in projects related to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Contract disputes are inevitably a risk in large-scale infrastructure projects between jurisdictions which are at different stages of development and legal maturity.          Dr Colin Ong, president of Arbitration Association Brunei Darussalam (AABD), made the comments during a panel session about infrastructure dispute resolution in a Belt and Road Summit.Belt and Road Summit 2017 was jointly organised by the Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), on September 11. A lot of focus was on ASEAN. In one of the sessions, a panel of arbitrators and legal professionals discussed the future of cross-border infrastructure investments related to the BRI.In Thilawa Special Economic Zone (which is not a BRI project), for example, some investors have used Singapore as the dispute resolution platform, because of the lack of confidence in the legal system in Myanmar. With an upsurge in investments and development of large-scale infrastructure brought about by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the HKTDC expected that infrastructure disputes will increase significantly in the coming years. When the legal system in the host country is not sufficiently advanced to cope with all the aspects of the projects and contracts, especially projects involving cross-border collaboration, there are risks.          investors-thilawa-sez.jpg                Contract disputes are an inevitable risk in large infrastructure projects between countries which have significantly different development levels and legal systems. Litigation is expensive and “may very well destroy relationships between the two parties involved”, the panel noted. Mediation and arbitration offer a more cost-effective way of managing dispute resolution.Rimsky Yuen, Secretary for Justice at the Hong Kong government, repeated the Asian Development Bank’s report that developing Asia will need to invest US$1.7 trillion per year in infrastructure to maintain growth, reduce poverty and cope with climate change. This includes investment in power, transport, water, sanitation and telecommunications infrastructure. The official emphasised that there is a pressing need to propose legal risk management with legal due diligence and contract drafting with risk-avoidance provisions and arbitration clauses. The BRI countries comprise over 60 jurisdictions with diverse legal systems, so there is a need for legal risk management. “Robust dispute-resolution mechanisms and professional legal advice are essential,” according to Mr Yuen.Joint Sino-ASEAN panelDr Colin Ong, AABD president, focused on some of the complex legal issues involving cross-border transactions. He emphasised that, for any BRI-led projects, a legal framework and dispute-resolution system must be in place from the start. He pointed out that there are no international standards for resolving legal disputes and that Belt and Road countries are at different stages of development and legal maturity. With contracts often involving three or more countries, the question becomes whose laws are applied, Dr Ong said. He argued that it is highly unlikely that a mature and reliable forum will be established to deal with complex disputes involving all Belt and Road countries, but that it was possible for a smaller bloc of countries to do this. “ASEAN, for example, is getting serious about harmonising laws and legal systems within the bloc,” he added. He suggested that this could be extended to include Hong Kong and, in theory, China. He argued against waiting for ASEAN to harmonise all of its laws because that would take too long, so it would be better to focus on establishing a common dispute-resolution mechanism. Dr Ong explained that the present dispute-resolution system focuses on government-to-government (G2G) contracts, but that this system needs to be extended to private enterprises. He proposed setting up a panel of arbitrators – 60 from ASEAN countries (six from each country) and 40 from China.Dispute resolutionJustin D’Agostino, head of disputes and managing partner in Asia for Herbert Smith Freehills, shared his firm’s findings of a decade of client research that his firm conducted to determine what their clients want in terms of dispute resolution. The findings showed overwhelmingly that they want more assistance with dispute avoidance, management and resolution, and that corporations with these systems in place can avoid disputes to begin with. His findings revealed that early case assessment (ECA) was common in the US and the UK, but not in Asia. Clients wanted more ECA to avoid escalation of disputes. With ECA, at the beginning of a dispute, a company estimates the money, time and human capital required to fight a case. It also engages an in-house legal team to assess the facts, legal issues and commercial interests at stake. ASEAN, for example, is getting serious about harmonising laws and legal systems within the bloc.- Dr Colin Ong, Arbitration Association Brunei DarussalamAdditionally, companies his firm conducted research on want more structured project management running disputes, not just lawyers, and they want more opportunities for meditation. The research indicates that mediation works, but that it is not yet as common in Asia as it is in the West.Mr D’Agostino presented a toolkit for managing bigger, highly complex BRI-related contracts and disputes which may arise. This involves mapping out all the tasks and activities involved in a dispute to determine the people, time and money required to manage the case. He pointed out that information technology was what he called “the big disruptor” because, very recently, new tools have become available in terms of digital platforms, which allow clients to see the work process much more clearly. Hence, they can buy into the dispute-management process more easily. The Herbert Smith Freehills partner argued that dispute resolution must be improved because when you get it right you resolve the dispute in a much more cost-effective manner for your clients than through litigation. The only drawback to arbitration is that there is very limited appeal against arbitral awards, according to Mr D’Agostino. But he believed that “the benefits far outweigh this [drawback]”, as arbitration allows more flexibility, ease of cross-border enforcement of arbitral awards, and more privacy as well as confidentiality.Contract detailsPaul Starr, partner and practice leader of Dispute Resolution and Infrastructure at King & Wood Mallesons in Hong Kong, brought up a case study to highlight the problems companies encounter because they pay insufficient attention to contract details. The firms fail to look closely at the “what-if” clauses – clauses which determine what happen if things go wrong. In this case a clause had been cut and pasted from one contract to another, but the information was not corrected. Thus, a badly drafted contract was secured, which resulted in the company potentially losing hundreds of millions of dollars.Mr Starr then suggested that Asian countries can be considered as a neutral platform for dispute resolution for Belt and Road countries. He observed that Hong Kong Kong as a neutral, independent centre for mediation and arbitration has its obvious legal and geographical strengths, as well as the quality of life that makes it a desirable destination for both work and pleasure.","/news/sino-asean-arbitration-panel-proposed-tackle-belt-and-road-disputes.html"
"79",79,"Beyond China: Nation must diversify FDI",2017-09-27,"Opinion","While for a long time the world has been focussed on political reforms in Myanmar during its transition from military rule to a democracy, the country has also witnessed a significant economic transformation.                         The most obvious sign of this is the sudden jump in foreign direct investment (FDI), from US$4 billion (K5.46 trillion) in 2013-14 to $9.4 billion in 2015-16. China is not only its largest trading partner, but also has made a huge investment in Myanmar. In fiscal year 2016, China invested $2.8 billion in Myanmar, while Singapore invested $3 billion, and even Vietnam’s investment was fractionally ahead of China’s, but over the past nearly three decades (1988-January 2017) China has invested $19 billion in Myanmar, far more than any other country.          China and Myanmar have maintained good relations for some time, and Beijing has enjoyed especially robust relations with the military junta, as evidenced by China’s FDI in Myanmar even during military rule. It is pertinent to note that China fervently backs Myanmar in the current Rohingya crisis. While the transition to democracy, and the thumping electoral victory of the National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in 2015, made many analysts sceptical about the direction of China-Myanmar relations, in view of her strong personal ties with India, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has dexterously navigated relations with both Asian powers. She said in one interview that “Myanmar should not be seen as a battleground. Rather it can emerge as a bridge between India and China,”Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has developed a strong rapport with China’s leadership in recent years. She met with President Xi Jinping in her capacity as opposition leader in June 2015, and, after becoming State Counsellor, she chose China for her first overseas visit outside ASEAN and since then has met with Chinese leaders many times.However, the relationship faces many obstacles. In 2007, a joint venture of the China Power Investment Corporation (CPI), Myanmar’s Ministry of Electric Power and the Asia World Company began construction of the Myitsone Dam on the Ayeyarwady River to supply power to China’s Yunnan province. The project was vehemently opposed by local people, because the river is considered the birthplace of Burmese civilisation and because of its environmental, social and economic effects. In 2011, then-President Thein Sein suspended the project due to nationwide protests. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has yet to decide the fate of the project. The problems don’t end there. Despite China’s huge investment in the country, Myanmar people perceive it as an exploiter rather than a benefactor. The Chinese face similar sentiments in other countries, such as Vietnam and Sri Lanka. Another problem is the slow pace of reforms in Myanmar. Political and economic reforms have been mired in controversy because of inconsistent formulation and drafting. The process was begun in 2011, with the creation of a commission to privatise state-owned companies, which handed over these companies to family members of politicians and highly placed officials. In 2012, the government passed a foreign investment law to allow formation of joint ventures with local partners and the leasing of land from the state and authorised companies, but critics argue that the law is being misused by cronies to grab land in anticipation of a deal with a foreign investor.Apart from this, the country’s infrastructure is in a very bad shape, with millions of people living without access to power and proper roads. Huge investments are needed in housing, connectivity, electricity and water supplies, health care, education and tourism. As per the Global Infrastructure Outlook report recently, of the 50 nations surveyed, Myanmar fared the worst in terms of infrastructure, for which, the report estimates, it requires the investment of $112 billion by 2040.Now the key question is which country or investor, other than China, would invest in such a volatile political and economic situation? In China, decisions are not taken by investment banks and private institutions but by the leadership, which attaches immense importance to the strategic and political implications of investments, apart from their economic benefits. In other countries, where the private sector plays an important role, things are different – efficiency and transparency are important prerequisites for FDI, as are political and economic stability. It is very difficult for investors to consider projects like the Myitsone Dam. Inept bureaucracy, lack of transparency, deep-rooted corruption and a lack of cooperation among ministries are red flags for investors. Myanmar’s new government should pay careful attention to the fact that foreign investment plunged roughly 30 percent between March 2016 and March 2017.Myanmar seriously needs to look at big investors beyond China, but genuine political and economic reforms are needed. Even after the successful transition from military rule to democracy, the military still holds the levers of power. By turning a blind eye to the atrocities against the Rohingya, and making a few perfunctory statements, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has done no favours to her position vis-à-vis the Myanmar army and the country’s image internationally. It remains to be seen whether there will be a course correction and the delivery of reforms that were expected after the NLD took over. If this does not happen, China’s economic stranglehold on Myanmar is likely to continue, which is likely to create popular discontent, as has been seen in other countries like Sri Lanka and Vietnam. – Special to The Myanmar TimesTridivesh Singh Maini is a policy analyst associated with the Jindal School of International Affairs at OP Jindal Global University in Sonipat, India.

"80",80,"ASEAN countries “keen” and “ready” for Belt and Road: HKTDC",2017-09-22,"Business","AS the top destination of Chinese investments, ASEAN means business when it comes to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a trade body said. The initiative is expected to require “staggering” infrastructural investments in Asia’s developing economies.          Jointly organised by the territory’s government and its trade body, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), the Belt and Road Summit, under the theme “from vision to action”, was held on September 11 in the city. The city’s leader, Carrie Lam, said during the event that ASEAN economies and geography make the regional bloc a key part of Beijing’s grand design.Not only is ASEAN strategically located on the Belt and Road routes, the region’s emerging economies are seen as future drivers of the regional and global economy.- Carrie Lam, Hong Kong Chief Executive“Undoubtedly, ASEAN will continue to be a focal point for the Belt and Road, with a number of major collaborative projects already under way in the region,” she observed.ASEAN “more ready”The Myanmar Times asked Vincent Lo, chair of HKTDC, about ASEAN’s position in the BRI compared to Eastern Europe and Central Asia. ""The ASEAN countries are more ready [to work with the Belt and Road]. They are ready. They are keen. Business will be done. I have no doubt about that,” Mr Lo told The Myanmar Times, adding the fact that the two high-level investment delegations he led were to ASEAN countries speaks for itself.In May, a Hong Kong-Shanghai infrastructure investment organised by the trade body visited Bangkok, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, during which they were received by Thai Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha and Vietnam’s Prime Minster Nguyen Xuan Phuc.          vincent-lo.jpg                “It is such a big pie. You need everybody. You need the whole world’s resources to try to get the BRI really up and running. We are now just scratching the surface.“With the infrastructure built, there will be a lot of investment going to all these places. If you look at China in the past 30 odd years, it started with infrastructure as well,” the HKTDC chair went further.Mr Lo emphasised again and again during the media interview that Hong Kong would only facilitate projects purely from a commercial perspective. Politically-charged projects are done by the leadership in Beijing, though he refused to comment on individual projects. “Theirs [China’s efforts to promote the BRI] is more politically driven. Obviously, Beijing will have their own agenda on who to invest in. But from Hong Kong’s perspective, we are looking at it purely from a business viewpoint.“Hong Kong is looking at it [the BRI] commercially,” he said. For politically-driven projects, project stakeholders will need to go to Beijing for investment. Many Hong Kong and Southeast Asian businesses view ASEAN as a core part of the BRI. The ASEAN countries are more ready. They are ready. They are keen. Business will be done. I have no doubt about that.- Vincent Lo, Hong Kong Trade Development CouncilBernard Charnwut Chan, president of Asia Financial Holdings, argued earlier that ASEAN and Myanmar’s geographical proximity to China will create immediate synergy and allow projects to take off more quickly. Research conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit reveals that over 60 percent of Chinese overseas direct investments in BRI countries in 2013-15 are directed at the ASEAN bloc.Speakers at the first panel agreed that policy coordination among governments is essential to the Belt and Road Initiative, as are the relaxation of restrictions, the removal of barriers and the promotion of investment, trade and commerce. Virasakdi Futrakul, Thailand’s deputy minister of foreign affairs, praised the city as a “strategic buckle” in the scheme.The second panel spotlighted ASEAN economies which have undergone rapid economic growth in recent years. Asia’s “staggering” infrastructural investment The Belt and Road blueprint requires “staggering” infrastructural investment in Asia’s developing economies, according to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).Luky Eko Wuryanto, AIIB Vice President, noted that the institution is interested in investing in infrastructure projects regardless of whether they are part of the Belt and Road framework.Asia’s developing economies need a “staggering level” of infrastructural development that they can’t afford on their own, he stressed. South Asia in particular has been left behind in the region’s development drive, which started in Japan in the 1980s, continued in South Korea in the 1990s, and has dramatically transformed China over the last two decades.Mr Wuryanto described the AIIB as a “new kid on the block”, founded only recently with a focus on the development of infrastructure and sectors including energy and power, transport and telecommunications, rural infrastructure and agriculture development, water supply and sanitation, environmental protection, urban development and logistics.The institution has a key role in negotiating the envisaged “cross-country connectivity”, while ensuring that “no country is left behind.”“Shared benefits should be clear and fair for all involved,” he said.While developing Belt and Road countries have been left behind in infrastructural development, he said they also face the challenge of huge population growth and urbanisation, with more than three billion, or half of the world’s population, gravitating to cities by 2050. At the same time they are grappling with the impact of climate change and environmental degradation.The big question is how to unlock their potential without aggravating existing pressures, he went on.The AIIB’s answer is “brand new approach – being lean, clean and green” with sustainable development. “We have to look for development solutions while also protecting a fragile environment,” he concluded. “That’s the key.”","/news/asean-countries-keen-and-ready-belt-and-road-hktdc.html"

"82",82,"In historic visit, HK leader sets out roadmap with Myanmar",2017-09-18,"Business","In the first ever visit by a Hong Kong leader to the country, Chief Executive Carrie Lam met with Myanmar officials and Hong Kong investors in Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw on September 15-17 to promote trade and investment ties.                         On September 16, the chief executive sat down with The Myanmar Times in Yangon’s Kandawgyi Palace Hotel to speak about the next chapter of Myanmar-Hong Kong economic partnerships and investment relations following the conclusion of a free trade agreement.           Mrs Lam told the media that the Hong Kong government’s prioritisation of its ties with ASEAN is a strategy to develop its economy and capitalise on the Belt and Road Initiative.ASEAN is currently the city’s second largest trading partner in goods and fourth largest in services. With the conclusion of the ASEAN-HK free trade agreement and the inking of the deal next month, the chief executive said that the next step would be working on bilateral relations with individual ASEAN member states to forge closer economic partnerships.Manufacturing and agricultureIn Myanmar, Mrs Lam’s mission is not limited to bringing inward investments into the city, but also supporting HK businesses to invest overseas. Myanmar’s abundance in labour and land make the country an attractive investment destination for manufacturers.“Hong Kong’s economic development is now constrained by two factors: land and labour. On both aspects, Myanmar has a lot to offer, because you are a vast country and you are a relatively young country with a lot of labour force,” she said. “Our capital does need to find an outlet to invest.“For some of our factories that want to find another investment destination, it does appear to me that Myanmar is a very good choice.”Back in June 2013, Hong Kong’s then-financial secretary John Tsang had visited Myanmar and agreed to negotiate a bilateral investment promotion and protection agreement. Mr Tsang said that Myanmar would be a beneficiary of the trend of Hong Kong-owned factories relocating from China’s industrial heartland to Southeast Asia due to labour shortages and rising prices.While the year-on-year growth in bilateral trade is significant, Mrs Lam conceded that the actual volume is modest. For example, in the agriculture sector, she saw enormous potential for scaling up Myanmar’s export in rice and fruits to Hong Kong. “Myanmar used to be a huge producer and exporter of rice but now Hong Kong imports most of the rice from Thailand and Vietnam, so there is every opportunity for an increase in food and fruit export to Hong Kong,” she noted, suggesting that conducting promotional activities showcasing the quality and variety of Myanmar products in Hong Kong would be helpful in bolstering the export volume. Access to capitalThe city’s leader highlighted that the territory is keen to leverage its expertise in infrastructure to serve Myanmar’s fast-growing infrastructure development.“I can say in terms of HK’s unique strengths: firstly we do have a lot of capital that we can invest, secondly we have very strong professional services, particularly in ports and airports. We are the world’s number one in terms of air cargo and we have a very important port, so there’s a lot of expertise in running ports and airports in Hong Kong,” she said. Citing that the city has been building a lot of infrastructures throughout the decades, Mrs Lam is buoyant on businesses leveraging their experience and expertise in the area of Myanmar’s infrastructure. Myanmar’s businesses are also welcome to join the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to raise capital, and undertake Chinese renminbi (RMB) trading in the city, which is the largest offshore RMB trading centre internationally.Building relationshipsThere are plans to enhance and leverage on relationships between the talent pool in Hong Kong and Myanmar. “I have plans to enhance Hong Kong’s position as a training hub for various professions, including financial services. We are happy to provide training programs to share experience in market regulation and so on with other countries,” she said.For Mrs Lam, the best way to promote people-to-people bond is through tourism as well as young people and educational exchanges. The city’s government plans to extend its Belt and Road scholarship, which is already in place for Vietnam and Indonesia, to Myanmar, sponsoring ASEAN students to undertake a bachelor program in a university in Hong Kong. “Myanmar is very rich in tourism resources but my figures told me that, on an annual basis, there are only a few thousand Hong Kong people coming to Myanmar. So there is a huge scope for promoting and developing tourism because Hong Kong people love to travel,” the chief executive said, suggesting that the relatively low tourism engagement is due to the lack of knowledge about the country.“Not enough people know about this country except [by] reading foreign newspapers,” she observed. Political stability paramount for investorsOn the Rakhine crisis, the chief executive said, “For investors, I think the number one concern is stability, and certainty, and transparency in operations, because they are putting in a lot of money. So, they want to have a business environment that is clear, that is certain, and that is stable. “In my various meetings with the State Counsellor [Daw Aung San Suu Kyi], the vice president [U Myint Swe] and various ministers, this message is very clear: they are also working very hard in attaining peace in the country, so I wish Myanmar every success in achieving peace.”She repeated “the clear message from the Hong Kong business community is that wherever they want to invest, they are looking for stability and certainty.” “They don’t want to be put in a situation where there’s always a lot of disruption to their business, [or] where government policies are uncertain or, in another words, would change from one day to another. That would make investments extremely difficult,” Mrs Lam emphasised.","/news/historic-visit-hk-leader-sets-out-roadmap-myanmar.html"

It is the first visit to Myanmar by a Hong Kong leader.                         On September 15, she met with senior Myanmar government officials in Nay Pyi Taw.          Mrs Lam first met with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The chief executive said that this is the first ever official visit by the chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) since the city’s return to China’s sovereignty two decades ago and Myanmar is the third ASEAN country she visited after assumption of office some two months ago.Given that Hong Kong and ASEAN are important trading partners and that Hong Kong and ASEAN have concluded the negotiations on a free trade agreement and a related investment agreement recently, the relationship between Hong Kong and Myanmar would become even closer, according to the city’s leader. She added that she hoped to work with the Myanmar Government to promote economic development in and the connection of the people from the two places.Mrs Lam then met with the Vice President U Myint Swe as well as Union Minister for Hotels and Tourism U Ohn Maung, Union Minister for Commerce U Than Myint and Union Minister for Planning and Finance U Kyaw Win.During the meetings, she said that the HKSAR government attaches great importance to promoting Hong Kong’s external affairs, and that the second Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (HKETO) in ASEAN was set up in Jakarta last month. In addition to trade and investment, her government is keen to promote co-operation with ASEAN countries in various areas, including tourism, culture and education. Noting that there is strong growth in the bilateral trade between the two regions in recent years and that many Hong Kong businesses are expanding their investment in Myanmar, she expressed the hope that more room for co-operation will be explored through this visit.           ce-visit.jpg                On September 16, Mrs Lam attended the 14th World Chinese Entrepreneurs Convention (WCEC). The WCEC was attended by some 2,000 Chinese businessmen from around the world. In her keynote address, the city’s leader said that Myanmar’s economic reform and opening up in recent years has brought about strong economic growth and attracted a large number of foreign investors, including those from Hong Kong.Noting that Hong Kong has been upholding a policy of a free and open economy over the years, she said Hong Kong is well aware of the benefits brought by an open economy, including the recognition as the freest and the most competitive economy in the world.“Attaching great importance to co-operation with Myanmar as well as other ASEAN members, Hong Kong expects that the Belt and Road Initiative and the development plan of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area of our country will lead us to a new economic era. With both Hong Kong and ASEAN along the Belt and Road, we hope to co-operate with Myanmar as well as other ASEAN countries to seize the opportunities arising from the Belt and Road Initiative,” she said.In the afternoon, Mrs Lam visited the Secretariat Building, the former government headquarters with a history of more than a century, to learn about its future revitalisation plan.The chief executive then toured a garment factory set up by Hong Kong investors. The factory commenced production in 2015 and was among the first batch of garment factories opened by Hong Kong businesses in Myanmar.While hosting a dinner for Hong Kong businesses on the same day, Mrs Lam said that members of the Hong Kong business community can leverage on Myanmar’s advantages on land and manpower resources to explore business opportunities, boosting economic developments in both places.","/news/myanmar-hk-ties-boosted-ce-visit.html"
"84",84,"Myanmar is where ASEAN, Belt and Road converge",2017-09-15,"Business","THE unique selling point of Myanmar is that it connects ASEAN, China and South Asia, businesses at the Hong Kong Belt and Road Summit told The Myanmar Times. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is expected to provide the impetus to turn Myanmar into a hub, facilitating trade and transport between the three regions, but the lack of infrastructure means that this advantage does not materialise.Jointly organised by the Hong Kong government and its trade body, the Belt and Road Summit themed “from vision to action” concluded on September 11. The Myanmar delegation consisted of U Min Thein, director general of the Department of Human Settlement and Housing Development under the Ministry of Construction, representatives from Marga Group, TV operator Sky Net and the Myanmar Licensed Contractors Association (MLCA), among others.The Myanmar Times sat down with members of the Myanmar delegation who shared their thoughts on the Belt and Road Initiative on September 11.Risks and infrastructuresU Zaw Naing, managing director of Mandalay Technology, urged a change of mindset for Chinese businesses in order to minimise disruption on communities and the environment. Doing so, he said, would help reduce the risk of widespread communal opposition against China-backed projects.Chinese investors, engineering companies and contractors need to improve the way they look at projects and the way they work and operate - U Zaw Naing, Mandalay TechnologyTomoaki Yabe, managing director of Thilawa-based Daizen Myanmar, said that the BRI provides the impetus to speed up the country’s infrastructure development. This, in turn, raises Myanmar’s competitiveness as a trading and logistics centre in the region.“Infrastructure improvement on connectivity is vital for the logistics sector. Improvement on roads and railways, ports and power plants, will definitely reduce the time and cost it takes for delivery and transport. This has huge implications for many sectors,” he observed.U Aung Khin Myint, chair of Myanmar International Freight Forwarders Association (MIFFA), told The Myanmar Times that the Belt and Road Initiative is a boost for transport and trade logistics sectors.“There are many risks for us when it comes to the BRI, but the risks can be managed. We need to find a solution to balance the benefits and risks,” he said.The BRI-led momentum in trade projects is timely, given that the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), which Myanmar has ratified, entered into force in February this year.“The Belt and Road Initiative is timely because the TFA, which Myanmar ratified, has come into force. The Myanmar government is carefully approaching the issue of WTO-TFA guidelines,” he noted.The Ministry of Transport and Communications is fully aware about the developments of the BRI, according to U Aung Khin Myint. In particular, initiatives for cross-border transport and logistics are gathering steam in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.“Myanmar and Thailand are going to sign the Memorandum of Understanding [MoU] on bilateral initial implementation of the cross-border transport facilitation agreement [IICBTA] soon. After that, Myanmar and China will sign the same IICBTA MoU. In addition, the highway between Muse and Mandalay will be upgraded from two lanes to four,” he added.The chair of MIFFA argued in favour of a multi-modal transport for the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) economic corridor. Adopting at least two means of transport connecting Kunming, Mandalay, cities in Bangladesh and Kolkata will be more “effective”.U Thet Win, MLCA adviser told The Myanmar Times that the organisation signed an MoU with China Real Estate Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong and International Chapter (CRECCHKI) on the same day, hoping to collaborate on developing the real estate sector in Myanmar.          myanmar_booth.jpg                Myanmar’s USPTomoaki Yabe stressed that Belt and Road’s blueprint for Myanmar revealed the country’s unique selling proposition (USP) but the hardware and software need to complement each other for the USP to work.“Myanmar’s role in the BRI’s two economic corridors demonstrates its geopolitical importance in bridging China and South Asia, China and ASEAN as well as ASEAN and South Asia. But this geopolitical USP - i.e. bridging ASEAN, China and South Asia - cannot be realised unless its regional infrastructure is in place.Being strategically located, Myanmar is where the Belt and Road ambition meets the ASEAN vision.- Tomoaki Yabe, Daizen Myanmar“Apart from the hardware, i.e. good roads and railways, the country needs to upgrade its software, such as customs operations, cross-border arrangements, insurance sector, regulations and many more.“The introduction of bonded warehouse, cross-border logistics pilot scheme, new Investment Law and the pending Companies Act are evidence that Myanmar is taking the rights steps to upgrade its software to position itself as the ASEAN-China-South Asia logistics and trading centre. But the hardware needs a lot of money to be built and there’s a lot to be done. BRI investments will be crucial.U Zaw Naing agreed with Mr Yabe’s view: the country is where ASEAN and Belt and Road converge. This line has time and again been echoed by politicians and pundits in the country. However, he added that Myanmar cannot afford to rest on its laurels because other countries, such as Vietnam, are well ahead in bridging the regions.“It is quite a challenge to see how long the window of opportunities currently open for Myanmar will remain open,” he remarked.The BRI will shape Myanmar’s infrastructure to become a hub between China and South Asia because that is of China’s national interest, according to U Zaw Naing. “Again, it is China’s utmost interest to develop the Kunming-Kyaukphyu railway, and possibly an elevated highway as well, as the trading and logistics route for western China. This will make up an important component of the BRI and the BCIM corridor. It links China up with the western part of the world without going through the Malacca Straits,” he said, adding that Myanmar may benefit from a significant increase in inflow of FDI and in terms of job creation. But there are concerns regarding land confiscations, environment degradation and impacts on communities.“In addition, Myanmar is involved in the China-Indochina Peninsula economic corridor, which encompasses many ASEAN countries. This corridor has seen a significant level of infrastructure already established,” he told The Myanmar Times.Chinese firms displacing othersU Zaw Naing was concerned that Belt and Road is going to help Chinese companies displace Myanmar and international companies in Myanmar.“We do see such trends. We have concerns that Chinese firms are moving beyond contractor work to become project owners and investors. The general public is worried that Chinese companies will control the ownership of the projects, facilities, real estate, roads, railways and the land of Myanmar.“There have been complaints that Chinese contractors are bringing in Chinese workers to Myanmar for many projects. We are not talking about only the high-level experts such as engineers or technicians, but also the labour workers. This means that people in the host country, i.e. Myanmar in our case, cannot benefit from the jobs created,” he said.In contrast, Mr Yabe brushed off concerns that Chinese companies will displace domestic and international firms, as long as Myanmar provides a level-playing field for businesses.“As our record has shown, Daizen welcomes Chinese businesses, Hong Kong businesses, ASEAN businesses and any investors who are interested to enter into Myanmar.“The joining of Chinese companies, as in any firms regardless of their origin, surely will raise the competitiveness and hence the quality of services, offering more options for customers, as well as increase the level of investments, given that we have a fair and transparent system,” he responded.          rbh_5953.jpg","/news/myanmar-where-asean-belt-and-road-converge.html"

That is why such programs for our people are so important,” said U Yee Mon, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Hotel and Tourism.Aircrafts operating between China and Myanmar can only transport 100 passengers at a time. The Chinese embassy will lobby to increase the number of airlines with better capacities, he added.“Recent airlines and aircraft capacity is small in comparison with China-Myanmar’s strong friendship. Embassies will mobilise both governments and related ministries on the issue. Furthermore, the hotel industry still needs to develop as Chinese tourists are interested in Myanmar, but the hotel capacity is not enough to accommodate all travelers; and it comes at a higher price” Mr Chen said.China has a population of 1.3 billion of which 122 million visited foreign destinations in 2016. They spent US$110 billion during their trip - an average of $900 per person. One fourth of Thailand’s foreign visitors come from China. Last year, close to 9 million Chinese tourists visited Thailand, according to Mr Chen. However, only a few Chinese tourists come to Myanmar, which is why they want to develop Chinese tourism in Myanmar, he added.“It is more expensive for a Chinese tourist to stay a week in Myanmar, due to hotel prices, than to visit Thailand, Malaysia or Singapore.  Even if we are a bigger contributor to Myanmar through foreign investment, only a few investments reach the hotel sector, because it is not a priority for China’s investment in Myanmar. We’re trying to persuade the government’s owned company and private company to invest in Myanmar’s hotel industry,” Mr Chen said.","/travel/first-china-myanmar-tourism-industry-training-course-opens-today-yangon.html"
"86",86,"Myanmar’s bargaining power rises along the Belt and Road",2017-09-11,"Business","AS Hong Kong’s second Belt and Road Summit started today in the city The Myanmar Times asked two experts from The Economist Intelligence Unit and Lau China Institute at King's College, London for their input regarding the dynamics of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and China in relation to Myanmar and ASEAN.          Much of the focus on China’s grand scheme in Myanmar has surrounded the development of the proposed Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and deep-sea port in Rakhine State. However, the BRI has a much broader implication on Myanmar both economically and politically. Back in 2014, Professor Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese Studies and director of the Lau China Institute at King's College, London, wrote that China can no longer reign supreme in many ASEAN member states, despite its economic muscle.“Chinese investment and trade are all welcome [in Cambodia], but the days of Beijing supremacy are long over,"" he wrote in an article.“A similar pattern can be seen in Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines and Laos. The era of stark choices between friends and enemies fostered by the Cold War has left a region with blurred allegiances and almost constantly changing loyalties,” he argued, adding that “China can search for leverage in vain in this new context, but it knows than even endless amounts of trade, aid, and financial largesse don’t buy much any longer.”Myanmar's  trump cardThese days, Nay Pyi Taw has more options beyond Beijing. “Myanmar occupies a unique position. It has travelled in the last few years from being a relatively dependent partner of China because of its diplomatic and economic isolation to one which, because of reforms and changes in the country, now has a much more diverse group of relations. “This has allowed it more autonomy and a less severe form of China-centric links. It's newly evolving relations with the US and the EU mean it simply has, very suddenly, more options,” he said.Still, China’s leverage over some ethnic armed groups in Myanmar can be seen as a political “trump card” over Nay Pyi Taw. The ethnic peace process is a top priority for State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the participation of those ethnic armed groups is essential for the peace process. Dan Wang, an analyst in The Economist Intelligence Unit‘s Access China service, told The Myanmar Times that Beijing’s sway over some ethnic armed groups has given China significantly more leverage over Myanmar than many ASEAN countries.“China has a bigger influence over Myanmar than other ASEAN members, because Myanmar relies on China to be a mediator in its ethnic civil wars. Other ASEAN countries do not face similar challenge in domestic stability. “Many of the ethnic armed groups have strong ethnic and cultural ties with China. For Aung San Suu Kyi, the top priority is to achieve peace and unity within the country. The National League for Democracy is unlikely to power through the democratic reform in the next two years, the military threat to take over power remains a real threat,” the Beijing-based analyst said.According to Ms Wang, China has several additional advantages over the US in terms of influence over Myanmar: China’s geographical proximity, Beijing’s willingness to extensively offer loans, technology and investment in the country's infrastructure through BRI framework, and the Chinese government has a relatively generous policy in taking in Myanmar refugees. The combination of these factors means China has a larger say in Myanmar’s internal affairs, compared to the US.However, Professor Brown argued that China would be hesitant to use this “trump card” in order to gain Nay Pyi Taw’s backing for its Belt and Road Initiative. “It [pushing those ethnic armed groups loyal to Beijing towards Nay Pyi Taw in exchange for Myanmar's support of BRI] would be a very extreme form of China trying to gain influence, particularly in view of its own vulnerability with regard to the management of ethnic minority issues. “It would also lay it exposed to the accusation that it was violating one of the most important parts of its rhetoric of diplomacy - non-interference in the affairs of others. This does not preclude informal and under-hand contact and support from Beijing - but the risks of being found out would be high, as would reputational loss. “China can use overt means to influence other countries now. Its covert era of activity belongs more to the past, particularly the Maoist past,” he said.Benefiting from ChinaMs Wang said that Myanmar should leverage not only China’s investments, but also the Chinese market.“The best strategy for Myanmar  would be to leverage on China's willingness to invest and expand its influence in Asia. China could be intimidating with its economic size and aggressive investment plans, but it is also the largest market. “As Myanmar becomes more open, tourist arrivals from China have surged; foreign trade also rose rapidly with improved infrastructure,” she said.The analyst added that Yunnan will play a pivotal role as a transport hub with South Asia and ASEAN, under the BRI, pointing to examples such as the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor (BCIM) and high-speed railway links with Southeast Asia. “The province shares a border with Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, which gives it a natural strategic importance. “Commercial ties between Yunnan and ASEAN countries, especially with Myanmar, have expanded since the signing of a free-trade agreement between China and ASEAN in 2010. “Electricity exports to Vietnam and Laos by Yunnan Power Grid, a subsidiary of the state-owned China Southern Power Grid, are growing quickly, highlighting the province's expanding role as a power supplier to neighbouring countries. Yunnan Power Grid sources some of its energy supply from Myanmar, where the company is involved in a controversial hydropower dam project,” she said.Bargaining powerMyanmar and other ASEAN countries should strategically work out what things they actually want from China in terms of investment, economic and political links, according to the professor at King’s College. They should also work out the benefits and risks of having deeper links with China, and more solid partnerships and trying to set out ways in which these can be mitigated and work out their own strengths and weaknesses regarding how to deal with China and what China wants from them. “The Belt and Road Initiative is an invitation by China to deal more with its growth, development and opportunities that flow from this. But every country in the region will have different perspectives on how best to deal with this opportunity,” Professor Brown said.Ms Wang argued that the BRI focuses on bilateral frameworks than ASEAN as a bloc. “The BRI has a strong influence to ASEAN development, but more on the bilateral terms, rather than with ASEAN as a whole. In recent years especially, as China has advanced aggressive territorial claims in the South China Sea, ASEAN has struggled to establish a common position on the disputes. In fact, aside from rough geography, there is no obvious trait that binds the ten nations together. “China has less trouble in its investment plans in small countries like Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, but more in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia over issues like environment, labour dispute and crowding out local businesses,” she explained.More significantly, the EIU analyst pointed out that Myanmar does not have much bargaining power over China’s scheme, contrary to what many domestic politicians and pundits said.Myanmar’s bargaining power over China’s investment plan is relatively weak, for its lack of infrastructure and funding. - Dan Wang, The Economist Intelligence Unit “Myanmar’s bargaining power over China’s investment plan is relatively weak, for its lack of infrastructure and funding.""From experiences of African countries, the locals benefit from improved roads and rails, although environmental issues become acute in certain areas,” she said.Dan Wang stressed that Myanmar should take advantage of this scheme when Chinese President Xi Jinping is still in office.“Given that Xi Jinping is the major force behind BRI, Myanmar is best to take advantage of the policy when he is still in power [possibly till 2022 or even five more years after that],” she said.","/news/myanmars-bargaining-power-rises-along-belt-and-road.html"
"87",87,"China ups its game in Myanmar’s SEZ race",2017-09-08,"Business","CHINESE investors have expressed an interest in investing and developing the area across Yangon River and to construct an international airport, a port and housing projects, according to a local Chinese business association. The proposed locality and projects overlap with the prospective South Korea-led special economic zone.          Members of the Yangon-headquartered Myanmar Chinese Chamber of Commerce (MCCC) plan to leverage the upcoming business convention as a platform to attract investments for infrastructure projects from international Chinese businesses.The 14th World Chinese Entrepreneurs Convention (WCEC), an annual business meeting for the Chinese businessmen and the Chinese business diaspora, is going to be held in Myanmar. The event will take place in Yangon from September 15 to 18.The organiser, the MCCC, expected more than 2,000 businessmen to gather in Yangon for the highlight: around 800 investors from Hong Kong and other countries, 800 investors from mainland China and 400 participants within Myanmar. Not surprisingly, the theme for the Chinese business meeting will be “Achieving historical milestones through economic liberalisation of Myanmar” with two emphases: ASEAN and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Businesses hope to exchange information and draw up strategies on navigating the emerging risks and opportunities in the BRI as well as ASEAN economic integration.Nay Pyi Taw, the government, needs to show that it has the clarity and vision regarding its involvement in China’s Belt and Road Initiative in order to make good use of this opportunity- U Ni, Myanmar Chinese Chamber of CommerceDuring the WCEC press conference on September 6, Yangon Mayor U Maung Muang Soe said that countries with weak or underdeveloped economies, such as Myanmar, need the collaboration from large economies, such as China, who act as a big investor. Securing the support of the top investors is essential in bringing Myanmar into the international economy.“We need to make the most out of the [WCEC] conference and grab the opportunities to speed up our economic growth,” he said.U Myint Shwe, MCCC chair, said Myanmar enjoys a unique strategic advantage in the BRI because of its geography, and that the country needs to take the chance to develop its economy alongside China's scheme. Airport and port in southern YangonChinese businesses have expressed an interest in an urban development project in southern Yangon Region spearheaded by Yangon Chief Minister U Phyo Min Thein, according to the MCCC chair. The project will be located across Yangon River, covering numerous townships including Dala.“According to the Yangon chief minister, there will be a big project involving a big international airport, a big port and housing projects in Dala and Kawhmu townships. “The investors behind this project may be Japanese or Chinese. “There is a Chinese business chamber, which is the biggest in mainland China, which is ready to invest US$5,000 million for that particular project. “I think the Chinese are rather affluent economically and have experiences in constructing infrastructure projects, and they can implement that project within a short time frame if they are allowed to invest,” he added.In December 2016, The Myanmar Times reported that plans were afoot for a second special economic zone (SEZ) in Yangon Region, which include a new international airport and access to a deep-sea port, according to regional government officials.The SEZ will be implemented across three southern townships – Dala, Kawhmu and Kungyangon, the MPs said. The chief minister declared that the Union government had given its support, and that work would begin in 2018, they told The Myanmar Times at that time. The proposed SEZ will be the second in Yangon Region after the Thilawa SEZ. The new zone will also have an international airport and a deep-sea port nearby, the Dala and Kungyangon MPs said.It appears that the urban development project in question is very similar to the South Korea-backed SEZ. Geographically, the two schemes overlap. In terms of infrastructures, both involve a new international airport and a port. More options for MyanmarThe Chinese investors are not satisfied with the delay in the Condominium Law, which will allow them to invest with much more options and flexibility in the country, U Myint Shwe said.Chinese investments in Myanmar have changed dramatically within the past few years. Government-to-government agreements have given way to the prominence of business-to-business deals, said U Ni, MCCC spokesperson.U Ni, who is also MCCC vice-chair and chair of WCEC organising committee, said that the Chinese used to be involved in many government-backed projects like Myintsone dam and mining sectors, but business-to-business investments have become very active nowadays. Chinese investments in bilateral trade have adopted a long-term view. This change in investment pattern is due to Myanmar’s liberalisation of its economy, and the new Investment law has provided much-needed clarity for foreign, including Chinese, investors, he added.Due to Western sanctions before 2012, Myanmar never had the options to pick and choose its investors. Now, the country has many more options on the table, and having more choices is good for Myanmar, U Ni explained. “Our intention to organise this conference in Myanmar is to have better choices which are not limited to mainland Chinese investors. “China has never refused to make a deal with Myanmar when Myanmar was suffering from sanctions. There is nothing to be worried about when any country plans to invest in Myanmar.“The key is to make sure investments align with the national interest of both sides,” he noted.U Ni said Myanmar needs to strategically map out how it can benefit from China’s surpluses in goods and expertise to fill its infrastructure gap.“China has a surplus of construction materials, manpower and technology, all of which are urgently needed in Myanmar. “Nay Pyi Taw, the government, needs to show that it has the clarity and vision regarding its involvement in China’s Belt and Road Initiative in order to make good use of this opportunity,” he said.","/news/china-ups-its-game-myanmars-sez-race.html"
"88",88,"China seeks ‘reliable’ ASEAN partners",2017-09-05,"Opinion","As the world’s No.2 economic power with growing political clout, China is working very hard to find regional strategic partners that are “trustworthy”. The desirable partners can be any countries in ASEAN that have minds of their own but understand the game of power politics. Most importantly, their foreign policy must not in any way, real or imagined, undermine China’s position in the region.                         Since China’s first foray into the ASEAN circuit in 1991, when it was invited as a guest of the ASEAN chair Kuala Lumpur, China-ASEAN ties have evolved in ways that are fast-paced and different from those with other dialogue partners.          Beijing’s bilateral ties with all South East Asian countries, which followed Beijing’s admission to the United Nations in 1972, proved useful in laying the groundwork for establishing ties with ASEAN and forging ASEAN-led cooperation. Not surprisingly China was the first major power to recognise ASEAN centrality, which cemented its position further and led to its accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in 2003.After all, China has established over 40 bilateral committees with ASEAN at all levels, covering the whole gamut of cooperation. Their leaders have met without fail 19 times, more than any other dialogue partners. From the beginning, whenever any broader ASEAN-China cooperative framework faced difficulties, whether economic or political and security, China would adopt a bilateral approach. That has always been the practice. It was not until 2012, during the Cambodian chairmanship, that this pathway came under criticism because it impacted longstanding ASEAN-China relations.Singapore-China ties have dominated regional and international news headlines recently. Any deterioration of their longstanding friendship would have far-reaching repercussions for overall ASEAN-China relations, of which Singapore is currently the country coordinator. The mutual friendship has now gone through a round of soul-searching on both sides, but their leaders have been quick to point out that nothing has changed in their relations.ASEAN more confidentDespite such an assurance, China is seeking new “trustworthy” strategic partners in ASEAN. Given the new dynamic within ASEAN, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, it will be a rather difficult task. ASEAN members, new and old, now are more confident and bolder in conducting foreign relations with major powers. While adhering to their commitments to ASEAN, they are also pursuing national interests, and each has displayed in unique ways a high level of diplomatic and hedging skills.Given the increased imperative of ASEAN-China relations and pressure from other dialogue partners, each bilateral relationship has become a transformative factor that can have implications for broader relations. Of late, China has also encountered such a phenomenon resulting from diplomatic changes, some more dramatic than others, in individual ASEAN members.Among the other ASEAN candidates on China’s list − Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand − none have the strategic assets of Singapore, which established diplomatic relations with China in October 1990.Truth be told, as far as China’s relations with individual countries are concerned, none of them can replace Singapore. After all, China has more investment in the island nation than in all other ASEAN members combined. From 2006 onward, Singapore received more than 50 percent of China’s investment in the ASEAN region. In 2015 alone, China invested about US$10.5 billion (K14.3 trillion) in Singapore, or 71pc, of its total $14.6 billion investment in ASEAN. The island’s excellent service facilities in finance and insurance as well as retail trade have attracted Chinese confidence and money. Nobody can tell whether China will continue this level of investment in Singapore in the future given their current geopolitical positions. Beijing often aligns its strategic objectives with it broader investment plans. ‘Willow diplomacy’On the surface, Thailand has often been cited as one of China’s best friends in the region, especially among core ASEAN members. Indeed, if Thailand is perceived as China’s strategic partner, it is an unreliable one because it does not take a firm stand that would alienate its friends or foes. Outsiders view such a policy as “willow diplomacy.” Recently, Thailand decided to purchase Chinese-made submarines, the first in the region, despite its status as a treaty ally with the US, but it was tough in protracted negotiations with China on a high-speed train project.When US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Bangkok recently, he asked Thailand to downgrade diplomatic ties and cut off trade with North Korea because of its recent intransigence over intercontinental missiles tests. While Bangkok did not agree, it was instrumental in drafting the group’s joint statement condemning Pyongang’s tests at the annual ASEAN meeting. Meanwhile, Thailand continues to welcome North Korean asylum seekers in its northern town of Chiang Saen, which it has been doing for over a decade without making headlines.Overall Thai-China relations are fragile, contrary to the general perception that they are very close. Their bilateral ties are only intimate among the elite and special interest groups, while people-to-people relations are fluid and flat. At least 12,000 Chinese tourists a day visit Thailand, the most in Asia, making the country the region’s most interactive with citizens of the People’s Republic. So far, both countries have shown resiliency and expediency in handling the cultural mishaps that occasionally crop up.Other cultural aspects still need consolidation. Out of nearly one million Thais studying Chinese today, only a few thousand have managed to pass the standard Chinese-language (Putonghua) test. The rest only speak, read and write mediocre Putonghua. Also, it is extremely difficult to name Thai scholars who specialise in Chinese studies. Harder still is to find those who use Chinese-language research sources in place of Western materials. Despite these shortcomings, Thailand boasts the region’s largest number of doctors − over 1,200 – practicing traditional Chinese medicine, and about 10 Thai universities offer such courses.In a similar vein, China’s investment in Thailand is minute in comparison to those in Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam. Thai investment in China is also limited to big conglomerates, not as many smaller-size companies as in Singapore and Malaysia, which display diverse commercial groups. These two ASEAN members also have sizable Chinese populations with strong cultural links.Therefore, China’s search for new trustworthy strategic partners will be difficult and time-consuming. At this juncture, no ASEAN country fits the bill. Both Cambodia and Singapore, despite their small sizes, have their unique strengths and voices in ASEAN while maintaining bilateral relations with China. With a new hierarchy of power and the radical changes associated with it, ASEAN as a group or individually today will be on full alert in forging new ties, trustworthy or otherwise, with the world’s No. 2 power. They have to wait and see whether China’s interests are aligned with what they have in mind.Kavi Chongkittavorn is editor-in-chief of The Myanmar Times.","/news/china-seeks-reliable-asean-partners.html"
"89",89,"ANP, Kyaukphyu businessman defend China’s reported majority stake",2017-09-05,"Business","THE head of Arakan National Party defended China’s majority stake in Kyaukphyu SEZ and advised against placing too much emphasis on the stake ratio. Meanwhile, a member of the Myanmar consortium said Myanmar will now own 30 percent of the project.Kyaukphyu is the location of various major projects, including a deep-sea port and oil and gas terminal at Madae Island, which already serves as the starting point for an oil and gas pipeline that runs across central Myanmar to Yunnan Province in southwest China. Kyaukphyu is also a core part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).U Aye Maung, chair of Arakan National Party (ANP), stressed that Rakhine State is a vital link for China to gain access to the Indian Ocean. No one can deny the fact that Kyaukhyu is the trade centre.“The Rakhine people should be prepared to get along with BRI developments as the BRI can provide the stimulus to spur Rakhine’s economic growth.“We need to improve the laws and regulations relevant to the special economic zone and issues related to land ownership.  The laws and regulations must be flexible to attract foreign investment, and they need to be consistent over the changes in government [political leadership],” he said.U Aye Maung said that, rather than just concentrating on Kyaukphyu SEZ’s stake ratio, Myanmar should focus on its long-term national interest.“We don’t have the [infrastructure] experience and capital. But what we can do is to design the policies based on the expertise, input and capital from international investors, and then to transfer the ownership of the projects back to Myanmar afterwards,” he said.The ANP chair added that Kyaukphyu SEZ is drastically different from the two other SEZs in the country, Thilawa and Dawei SEZs. Kyaukphyu SEZ is a business-to-business project while Dawei and Thilawa are implemented under government-to-government agreements.“The business to business model is entirely shaped by the commercial interest of both sides, the two consortiums.The issue of majority stake is not as important as the transfer of technology and investment capital. The latter two are vital for the Kyaukphyu project to succeed. - U Aye Maung, Arakan National Party“Taking shares is to shoulder financial responsibility. Apparently, neither the Myanmar government nor Myanmar companies can afford to invest the amount of capital required by the deep-sea port or has the technology to manage the project at the moment,” he said.U Aye Maung’s line of defence differed from those who are concerned about China’s reported majority stake of the SEZ, but echoed the views of a member of the Myanmar consortium.A consortium led by China’s CITIC Group has proposed taking a 70-85 percent stake in the US$7.3 billion deep-sea port, according to Reuters on May 5. One of the sources, who declined to be named, said Myanmar was unlikely to ask for a stake of more than 30pc due to opposition from the Chinese firm.“There is nothing to be worried about”U Kyauk Taung, chair of the public company Htar Wa Ra Aung Myay and central executive committee member of Myanmar Kyaukphyu SEZ Holding Company (MKSHC), told The Myanmar Times that CITIC’s 85 percent stake was approved by the previous government and that the new government merely inherited the project with the 85pc-stake agreement. The MSKHC is a consortium of Myanmar companies involved in the SEZ project.“Regarding the Chinese majority stake, there is nothing to be worried about.“This is because we have a SEZ management committee which was formed by the government to manage the issues related to the project.“We have been in negotiations with different parties for the Myanmar side to acquire a 30pc stake in the project. And, on this issue, the Myanmar consortium, the SEZ management committee and CITIC have reached an agreement late last month,” U Kyauk Taung said.According to U Kyauk Taung, many meetings between the Chinese consortium and its Myanmar counterpart were held before the two sides agreed on the 70-30 stake ratio, but further negotiations regarding other details are needed before the signing of the MoU.He added that the road networking connecting Kyaukphyu SEZ and its port with China is by far the most important priority for the project.“If not, the project is nothing,” he remarked.U Kyauk Taung explained that the Myanmar consortium, including his company, do not have sufficient capital to take a majority stake of the $7.2-billion deep-sea port. If even the consortium has the capital to construct the port, they do not have the technology to manage its operation.Kyaukphyu vs ThilawaChina’s reported majority stake in Kyaukphyu is categorically different from Japan’s minority stake in Thilawa SEZ.Myanmar Japan Thilawa Development, a joint venture between Japan and Myanmar which is in charge of development and management of Thilawa SEZ, is owned 49pc jointly by three major Japanese trading houses – Marubeni, Sumitomo and Mitsubishi – and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). 51pc of the venture is owned by the Myanmar government and the Myanmar consortium of companies.When asked by The Myanmar Times why Japan took 49 percent and Myanmar took 51pc of Thilawa, Takashi Yanai, MJTD president, said that the 2pc stake difference, i.e. giving Myanmar a majority stake, reflects MJTD’s intention to allow Myanmar to harvest more benefits from the SEZ than Japan. “Our intention is to share the benefits of the Thilawa SEZ project with Myanmar more than with Japan. For this project, both Myanmar and Japan are on the same boat and have cooperated with each other well,” said Mr Yanai, who declined to comment on issues related to Kyaukphyu.On September 4, U Soe Win, Kyaukphyu SEZ Management Committee chair, told The Myanmar Times that nothing is confirmed regarding Kyaukphyu SEZ yet since everything is still under negotiations.“Nothing can be confirmed yet. Everything can be changed for now, including the stake ratio,” he said.Doing good to Rakhine vs Myitsone dam 2.0The Kyaukphyu project has received mixed commentary from experts and businesses in the past.During the 2nd ASEAN-Myanmar Forum hosted by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs on June 28 in Sedona Hotel, Ong Chao Choon, managing director of PwC Myanmar told The Myanmar Times that the BRI provides the much-needed political will and financial resources for Myanmar and Asia’s infrastructure gap. “The biggest project is the test case [of the BRI] and we hope to see it breaking ground in the next six to 12 months, for the Kyaukphyu project.“That is an investment in a part of Myanmar that really needs investment, one of the poorer parts of Myanmar – Rakhine State.“The Kyaukphyu project will do a lot of good to Rakhine State and Myanmar as a whole,” he observed.In contrast, Simon Tay, chair of SIIA, told The Myanmar Times in the same occasion that China’s reported majority stake in Kyaukphyu is “unwise for China and for Myanmar in the long term”.Mr Tay said that the difference in foreign ownership between Kyaukphyu and Japan-led Thilawa SEZ is “stark” and “noticeable”.“The Japanese really make an effort to work with Myanmar by giving Myanmar 51 percent. Of course, the 2pc isn’t so important [practically] but it is an important symbol as a sign of friendship and equality.“The Japanese are really trying to make an effort to be a partner rather than to dominate.“If I was advising the Chinese, I would never ask for 85 percent in natural gas and oil because it’s the heritage and soil of Myanmar,” he said.“You want to structure the Kyaukphyu project so you are always aware that, unlike Myitsone dam, you cannot take the benefit and leave the problems behind [to the community].“If you give someone 85 percent of the vote, or ownership of the project, I think it’s very hard [to find a solution which works for both sides],” Mr Tay continued.","/news/anp-kyaukphyu-businessman-defend-chinas-reported-majority-stake.html"
"90",90,"Govt urged to establish Belt and Road taskforce",2017-09-01,"Business","From tackling illegal border trade to constructing Kyaukphyu SEZ, the to-do list for Belt and Road in Myanmar is very long.                         THE Myanmar government is urged to take a proactive role and form a taskforce to carve out its involvement in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). An adviser to the National League for Democracy-led government stressed the need to scrutinise debt while others voiced the need to explore how connectivity will compromise the country’s sovereignty and identity.Launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 as “One Belt, One Road”, the initiative involves China underwriting billion-dollar investments, mainly in physical infrastructure, in countries along the land-based Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road, creating an extensive trade network by linking the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa. The scheme gained much fanfare in the country when State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi paid a visit to the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in the Chinese capital in May.Sean Turnell, an economic adviser to the National League for Democracy-led government, pointed out the need to scrutinise debt arrangements while highlighted the opportunity for Myanmar to expand its export markets via the scheme.“The Belt and Road Initiative offers the possibility of a number of highly beneficial infrastructure investments for countries such as Myanmar.“To the extent that these connect the region and lower the costs of trade, then all of this is not just good – but very much consistent with the government’s philosophy of expanding and diversifying the markets for Myanmar’s exports.Naturally, countries undertake investments for their own benefit first, and so a similarly realistic appraisal of BRI projects will be undertaken, just as in all other projects too. In particular, any debt or similar commitments must receive close scrutiny. - Sean Turnell, NLD economic adviserMarshall Plan of the 21st centuryU Zeya Thu, senior research fellow at Myanmar Institute of Strategic and International Studies, pointed out that Myanmar is not included in the previous BRI blueprint, but Beijing’s grand design would not be complete without Myanmar’s participation.“Myanmar is one of the core parts of the initiative, and the country must take part in it.“But we have to do so in a way which achieves a win-win situation. Myanmar has to think carefully about the benefits and problems associated with joining the scheme.“It is not possible for us to take part in the BRI without taking into account the national priorities or interest of Myanmar,” he said, adding that the country’s geostrategic advantages has rendered it “the new crossroad of Asia” and has received a lot of international interest.“One of the foreign experts told me that the land bridge of Southeast Asia in Myanmar is not yet constructed. This reflects the level of infrastructure gap the country is suffering at the moment.“The Belt and Road Initiative is one of the solutions.“But whether it will resolve the problem hinges on how our policymakers work with China and how much the country will benefit from the BRI. The challenges will remain but we should minimise the risks,” U Zeya Thu said.“Some international experts have been comparing the Belt and Road Initiative with the Marshall Plan, which is officially known as the European Recovery Program [ERP]. The ERP covers the period when the United States injected financial aid into the Western European countries to help them rebuild their economies after the Second World War.“Those experts said that this is the Marshall Plan of the 21st century,” he went on.Sovereignty and identityU Tin Maung Maung Than, senior research fellow at ISEAS (Institute of Southeast Asian Studies) and who researches about ASEAN, said that China is pushing the BRI in order to sustain its economic growth as well as maintain the regime’s own political survival. But the problem with Myanmar is that Nay Pyi Taw does not know the details on which part of the scheme the country is involved in.“China announced this plan after calculating how much it will benefit from the scheme; Myanmar still doesn’t know how the country will benefit, how many local people will be employed, and how much of Myanmar’s sovereignty will be affected.“We don’t know how to measure the sovereignty. We don’t know how much sovereignty will be compromised when the roads and railways are constructed,” he argued.U Zaw Aye Maung, regional minister for the Ministry of Rakhine Ethnic Affairs of Yangon Region, said that China has to be a good neighbour of Myanmar.“At the same time, we need to grab the opportunity from the BRI by protecting our sovereignty and identity of Myanmar,” he said.Govt taskforce urgently neededMyanmar’s objective in joining the BRI is to acquire economic benefits from areas such as information exchange, advanced technology, prevention of transnational crime, elimination of drug trafficking and cracking down of illegal border trade along the BRI corridors.U Aye Lwin, member of NLD Central Executive Economic Committee, highlighted the need to tackle illegal trade at the borders.“We need a law enforcement mechanism and infrastructure development at the border areas to eliminate illegal trade.“We consider this scheme as a possible solution for some of the issues which Myanmar is having at the moment,” he said.U Zeya Thu stressed that the government urgently needs to form a taskforce to draw up the country’s involvement in the Belt and Road Initiative. The taskforce needs to be formed with the input and collaboration with the Ministry of Planning and Finance, the military or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.“Belt and Road can be an Asia-led globalisation. The project is such a grand one. But this China-led project must primarily serve the interest of China, not the interest of Myanmar or other participants.“Hence, what we can do is to draw strategy to show China what would work alongside Myanmar’s national interest,” he said.Indonesia’s $28b ambitionJakarta Globe reported on May 24 that Indonesia sought to draw up to US$28 billion worth of investment from Chinese investors from hundreds of projects put on the table during the Belt and Road summit in May. According to the Ministry of Planning and Finance, Myanmar has not come up with any similar plan.U Tun Tun Naing, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Planning and Finance, said the country agreed to join the game when the State Counsellor went to Beijing. But the government has not laid out the details of its involvement.“It is not just about the Belt and Road. We have a whole range of areas to collaborate with China and neighbouring countries at the same time. Hence, it can’t be done by turning a blind eye.“We have some projects which are in the pipeline already, some pending to go ahead, some which are suspended but will restart, and some new ones as well.“The decision of each project depends on our national interest, the development of our country and how we can be benefitted. We are going to mull over the issues very carefully when making decisions related to the BRI-led projects,” he said.At the BRI summit in May, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi stressed that BRI-led projects should complement national priorities and take into account the welfare of local communities.The Myanmar Times also interviewed Myanmar and foreign businesses on their views. Businesses generally welcomed the investment boost for the country’s infrastructure but many emphasised the importance of transparency, public engagement and adhering to international practices.","/news/govt-urged-establish-belt-and-road-taskforce.html"
"91",91,"State Counsellor stresses Belt and  Road needs to align national priorities",2017-08-28,"Business","At the BRI summit in May, the State Counsellor stressed that BRI-led projects should complement national priorities and take into account the welfare of local communities, and highlighted the need to ensure responsible business practice.                         Local analysts and commentators in Myanmar have spelt out some of the benefits and risks of Myanmar’s participation in Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).          Launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 as “One Belt, One Road”, the initiative involves China underwriting billion-dollar investments, mainly in physical infrastructure, in countries along the land-based Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road, creating an extensive trade network by linking the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa. The financial commitment illustrates the ambition: China is spending roughly US$150 billion a year in the 68 countries which have signed on to the project.While President Xi announced his grand plan when he visited Kazakhstan and Indonesia in 2013, the BRI did not attract the attention of the government, private sector and media in Myanmar until State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi paid a visit to the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in the Chinese capital in May.During a roundtable session of the forum on May 15, the State Counsellor said that connectivity covers not only physical or infrastructure connectivity, but also institutional connectivity and people-to-people connectivity. Because of its multi-facetted nature, connectivity cooperation would need to complement existing national and regional platforms.Daw Suu also stressed that BRI-led projects would be the most effective if they are designed to re-enforce or complement existing or planned projects of participating countries and regional organisations. This is because the priority must be to take into account the expectations and concerns of individual governments and the peoples.She added that each partner country has its own considerations and the best multi-national initiatives are those which align well with national plans. Myanmar has laid out its own Road Network Master Plan and it is also taking part in a number of ongoing regional projects.The State Counsellor emphasised the need to ensure that business activities are carried out in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. Conservation of the natural environment and welfare of local communities are essential for the success of development projects. The creation of employment opportunities for the local people is also an important factor.The State Counsellor’s concerns echo those of the business community.The McKinsey senior partner told The Myanmar Times in June that success of the BRI in Myanmar would depend on the country creating an investor-friendly environment and developing sufficient human capital. Additionally, human capital poses a bigger challenge than the financial issue and would determine how the country fares compared to the rest of ASEAN.“Myanmar, given its size, population and proximity, would be very well-positioned to benefit from those investment flows. Whether in fact it does, depends on the investor-friendly environment and the availability of human capital for support.“I don’t think financial capital is the big issue here – there’s more than enough money around – but how to put to good use in getting good projects, earn a return, and can be sustainably managed by a local workforce determines how much of that capital actually comes to Myanmar,” he said.Benefits and risksMyanmar’s role in the BRI is very clear and obvious. Local economists are estimating the benefits and risks associated with the country hopping on the BRI train. Opportunities are policy coordination, which contributes to a better Sino-Myanmar strategic cooperation and which offers bilateral policy coordination in multilateral frameworks.The benefits also include a boost for infrastructure and connectivity, fewer barriers for trade via bilateral economic and trade cooperation and financial integration, resulting in more foreign direct investment (FDI), and a better standard of living. At the same time, BRI presents many challenges. It is essentially a great-power game at a multilateral level, according to numerous analysts The Myanmar Times interviewed. Additionally, there are cognitive differences between China and Myanmar on the definition of a win-win cooperation. Myanmar’s internal dilemmas and issues regarding religion, ethnic minorities, devolution and the peace process are all uncertainties which might negatively affect Sino-Myanmar relations. U Aye Lwin, member of NLD Central Executive Economic Committee, said that high-level cooperation such as G-to-G coordination is required but it is imperative to strengthen civil and non-governmental interactions between the two countries. He suggested that it is necessary to leverage traditional media as well as other new channels to promote Myanmar and facilitate bilateral relations with short-term and long-term considerations taken into account. FDI and foreign loanChina is the top investor in the country, accounting for more than a quarter (26 percent) of the total foreign investment as of July 31, according to the data released from Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA).The picture is similar in terms of foreign debt: Myanmar has accumulated foreign loan totalling US$9.16 billion and 44pc of that sum was borrowed from China.Economist U Khin Maung Nyo, vice president of Myanmar Economics Association noted that China has been offering loans to some of the countries in Asia. But countries such as Myanmar should be concerned with the debt trap. U Aye Lwin added that the country is situated between two giant markets but it has so far failed to translate that geographical advantage into economic strength in the past years.“It is not possible to deviate from the direction set by your neighbouring countries.“This time, I think it is a good opportunity to get ahead with the economic development scheme of the region. “The important priority is to improve infrastructure to the areas covered by the BRI.Enhance the infrastructure in BRI-related regions and develop the transport, tourism and businesses there. The government needs to liberalise rules and regulations to improve the ease of doing business,” he said.Earlier, The Myanmar Times interviewed Jonathan Woetzel, McKinsey senior partner, Bernard Chan, president of Asia Financial Holdings and grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, as well as domestic and international businesses from various countries and industries on the scheme’s implications, opportunities and challenges for Myanmar.Mr Chan noted that physical infrastructure is the first phase of the BRI.“The first wave of these so-called initiatives will be about infrastructure, followed by trade and then other development such as tourism. Infrastructure is the most imminent,” he said.What did Daw Suu say about Belt and Road?Key points of the State Counsellor’s speech at the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation:– BRI-led projects would be more effective if they complement the agenda of individual governments and regional organisations.– The best multi-national initiatives align well with national priorities.– Businesses need to be socially and environmentally responsible.– The welfare and job opportunities of local communities are essential.","/news/state-counsellor-stresses-belt-and-road-needs-align-national-priorities.html"
"92",92,"Myanmar needs English proficiency to plug into international economy",2017-08-24,"Business","Myanmar's population, as well as ASEAN’s, needs to develop a proficiency in English in order to bridge the country’s growth with the international economy, a Malaysian business leader said.                         The Myanmar Times sat down with Tan Sri Datuk Yong Poh Kon in his company’s headquarters in Kuala Lumpur on August 14 to review the experiences of Malaysia in tackling bureaucracy to improve the business environment. He is the chair of Kuala Lumpur-headquartered Royal Selangor International, a pewter company.          Tan Sri Datuk Yong Poh Kon shared his experience in leading Malaysia’s business facilitation taskforce with Myanmar’s PSD (Private Sector Development) Committee on April 5 in Nay Pyi Taw.As part of the interview, the Royal Selangor chair said ASEAN and Myanmar needs to be “plugged in” to the international economy and proficiency in the English language is essential. He has put forward the notion before.Malaysian media reported in early March that he argued for the importance of a good command of English for Malaysia’s economic competitiveness.“Malaysia needs to maintain a population that has a high-proficiency in English to remain competitive, as the country is reliant on international trade,” he said back then.Mr Yong believed that the same applies to Myanmar and the rest of ASEAN.“Malaysia’s import-export trade is more than our [Malaysia’s] GDP. “If that’s the case, you really need to be ‘plugged in’ to the world and international economy and the most important language for trade is English,” he said. For larger economies such as Indonesia’s, their international trade has a smaller in their economy and hence they can afford to be more relaxed about plugging in.“Even in Japan – where their import-export trade is less than their GDP – many of the corporations are adopting English as their ‘company language’ so they send out managers who are proficient in English in international distribution and to engage with the outside world,” he noted.But didn’t China’s economic growth succeed without having a population which is highly proficient in English? “There are two ways that you can look at for China and Myanmar. Myanmar is very rich in resources with a medium-sized population but it is still small in relation to China’s. “China is huge – their domestic market so big and they are able to produce items and their economic landscape is so large that people have to adapt to China instead. “[Additionally,] they have a tremendous amount of expatriates and re-patriots who are going back and, on top of that, they recruit foreigners to work – look at Huawei, look at Shenzhen.“All this will help China’s efforts to change ... at least they [China] have a choice.“But for smaller countries like us [Malaysia] – we have absolutely no choice; we have to adopt an international language,” Mr Yong remarked, adding that English takes precedence over Chinese as the lingua franca.He emphasised that there are no shortcuts when it comes to building a business. SMEs should focus on their own national markets before going regional or international.“A company that wants to go regional must first be reasonably strong in your own market – building a base within your market. “Then, with reputation and experience, you are able to move to another country, but you must always start with your neighbouring countries – step by step. Always provide goods and services that will endear your customers to you. “And from then on, you can move onto a further field. No shortcuts,” he stressed.The former co-chair of PEMUDAH also observed that Myanmar’s economic development would mirror Malaysia’s transition from a commodity-based economy to an economy which services and manufacturing play a bigger part.“Malaysia’s transition from a commodity-based economy to a manufacturing-based economy, and then to a more service-related economy has been done [started] since the 1960s. “We started the Investment Incentives Act, where we provided incentives to literally encourage foreigners to bring in investments,” Mr Yong told The Myanmar Times.The Investment Incentives Act 1968 of Malaysia encourages foreign direct investment into the country by tax relief from income tax and payroll tax, for a period between two and eight years.“In Myanmar’s case, it will probably be the same: with a tremendous amount of rich resources you have to develop commodities: gems, mining and timber. As soon as these are developed, the secondary usage of these materials – processing and manufacturing – will probably parallel what Malaysia has gone through,” he concluded.","/news/myanmar-needs-english-proficiency-plug-international-economy.html"
"93",93,"More FDI essential for substantial increase in garment exports",2017-08-09,"Business","Foreign direct investments (FDI) in labour-intensive activities such as garment exports should be actively promoted from China and elsewhere in order to facilitate Myanmar’s economic transformation, according to the latest briefing paper published by a UK-based think tank.                         The study called for an expansion of training in the garments sector to tackle shortages of high-level skill as well as complementary reforms in finance and trade policy.          The briefing paper Foreign direct investment and economic transformation in Myanmar, written by Stephen Gelb, was published in June 2017 by Supporting Economic Transformation (SET).Funded by the UK Department of International Development (DFID), SET is an Overseas Development Institute-led (ODI-led) program which aims to provide practical policy support to governments and their partners in development countries. The Overseas Development Institute is a London-headquartered think tank specialising in international development and humanitarian issues.The briefing paper is a summary brief of the ODI report of the same title. The report explores the potential for FDIs, including from China, to contribute positively to economic transformation and poverty-reducing growth, focusing mainly on garments and construction.In value terms, China is the largest foreign investor in Myanmar, and power and oil and gas are the largest sectors, based on data provided by the Department of Investment and Company Administration (DICA). But Chinese and Hong Kong investments are substantial in the garments sector as well.The briefing paper argued that FDIs in Myanmar’s garments industry has been significant and that the sector is a major job creator.As of mid-2015, about 55 percent of registered garment firms in the country were known to be fully or partly foreign-owned, according to data from the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association. Among them, a quarter came from China, 17pc from Hong Kong, 29pc from South Korea and 12pc from Japan.The publication stated that foreign-linked firms supply almost all garment exports, and these have surged in recent years. The lifting of EU and American sanctions helps further boost export growth.The industry creates a lot of jobs, with around 200,000 employed in total in mid-2015, and a quarter of the workforce were hired in Chinese and Hong Kong firms. However, the paper argued that these foreign-linked garment firms have produced few benefits, linkages or spillovers in Myanmar beyond export and job creation.It further pointed out that the foreign-owned firms have very few local managers, reflecting the country’s shortage of high-level skills.The publication argued that FDIs are essential in the garments sector.“... Myanmar cannot meet its [garment exports] target in either sector [garments or construction and infrastructure] without substantial numbers of new mid-size firms.“Since competitive local firms have not emerged in large numbers, more FDI is essential in both sectors, and China is the most likely source, given its economic size and geographic proximity,” it stated.It recommended the country to ease entry restrictions and get rid of “cumbersome procedures”, which discourages transparent formal entry by international businesses.“Myanmar should further ease entry and undertake active investment promotion in garments and other labour-intensive exports such as footwear...“Entry of Chinese and other foreign garment assemblers could also be encouraged through engagement with buying firms, especially global retail or apparel corporations,” it noted.Additionally, three solutions were suggested to tackle Myanmar’s shortage of entrepreneurial, management and technical skills in the garments sector. The short-to-medium term measure is “labour circulation” – the movement of foreign and domestic skilled employees from international businesses to existing and new local ones. Entrepreneur support policies should also be made available to foreigners as well as the Myanmar diasporas.In the longer term, the country should develop tertiary educational institutes which are dedicated to the garments industry in order to increase the supply of managers and technicians in the sector.The paper called for various financial and trade reforms, such as making access to trade credit possible for garment exports and providing tariff-free fabric imports to both free-on-board (FOB) and cut-make-package (CMP) producers.Foreign direct investment and economic transformation in Myanmar also analysed the FDIs in construction and infrastructure sectors.Highlights of the briefing paper- Foreign direct investment in labour-intensive activities such as garment exports and mass housing should be actively promoted from China and elsewhere, to enhance economic transformation in Myanmar.- Over and above increased investment in these sectors, significant expansion of training is needed to address shortages of high-level skills, such as those of managers and technicians.- Complementary reforms in finance and trade policy are urgently needed to realise the transformative impact of both foreign and domestic investment.","/business/27181-more-fdi-essential-for-substantial-increase-in-garment-exports.html"
"94",94,"Why agriculture is ailing and how best to revive the sector",2017-08-09,"Business","Agriculture forms the backbone of the Myanmar economy.           The sector contributes to almost 40 percent of the nation’s GDP, accounts for close to a third of total exports and employs more than 60pc of the workforce, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Yet, just 1pc of foreign direct investments (FDI) in the country is channeled into the sector, while bank loans extended to agriculture businesses have contracted sharply since 2016, data from the Central Bank of Myanmar reveals.“Agriculture is one of the most important sectors in the Myanmar economy. About 70pc of local businesses are directly or indirectly involved in the agriculture supply chain. But investments in the sector have not been satisfactory,” U Aung Naing Oo, director general of the Directorate of Investment & Company Administration, told The Myanmar Times.One setback is the lack of a clear legal framework under which investors can operate. “We have a number of laws governing agriculture and land use in Myanmar but in reality, those laws are not that clear,” said U Aung Naing Oo. For example, the Myanmar Investment Law allows investors to operate an agriculture business for up to 50 years, however the Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Land Law has a 30-year limit.“This is a grey area for investors. It is not clear whether they are allowed to do business for 30 or 50 years. We must have a clear land policy to attract more investments in the agriculture sector. If we don’t have a proper policy framework, it will be too risky for potential investors,” he said.Working togetherCurrently, the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) is working with Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation to develop options under which investors – both local and foreign – can work with local farmers.“We are working out ways to combine the funds and technology from multinational investors with the land and labour provided by local farmers here. Many farmers have land but insufficient capital to cultivate their land. We are still working out the best options for both parties so that each side benefits,” said U Aung Naing Oo.Decisions will also be made on which type of crop to promote. Seasonal crops like beans, for example, are harvested under different conditions than perennial crops such as nuts and seeds. “We need to decide which crops are most beneficial for both farmers and investors and promote the right ones so that neither side loses out.”Price fluctuationsBut the main reason for low agriculture FDI is high risks versus returns. For one, success in the agriculture business highly depends on weather conditions. Meanwhile, crop damage due to draughts or floods are costly and could delay returns on investments.In addition, fluctuations in price due to demand and supply are also hard to predict and control. The sugar industry in Myanmar, for example, is currently at the brink of collapse owing to a massive glut after sugar exports bound for China were turned away.Currently, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation is working with the Ministry of Commerce to implement short-term controls to stabilise the prices of Myanmar’s range of crops. For example, a total of 56 sugar companies with the license to import and re-export sugar to China have been banned from doing so.Ultimately though, new markets must be found for Myanmar’s agriculture produce. “In 2000-2005, Myanmar’s main export markets for rice were Africa and Indonesia. We exported half a million tons of rice to Africa and some 200,000-300,000 tons to Indonesia every year,” said U Aung Naing Oo.That changed in 2010, when demand from the Chinese overtook all other markets and China became Myanmar’s main export destination for rice and many other crops. “Now that demand from China is slowing, we must restore all our other markets in Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia and not rely on China alone,” he said.Another example is India. “We are totally reliant on the Indian market for our pulses and bean exports. We need to diversify into new markets. The potential is there but we must be more proactive in marketing our exports to other countries. Market diversification is extremely important.”New marketsIn fact, many developed countries such as Singapore and Japan have expressed interest to invest in Myanmar’s agriculture. In 2014, Singapore’s Wilmar International formed a local joint venture to produce and sell sugar in Myanmar. At the time, the Wilmar-controlled JV held two sugar mills with a total milling capacity of 4000 tonnes of sugarcane per day and a total production capacity of 65,000 tonnes of sugar per year, a bio-ethanol plant and one organic compound fertilizer plant. Another potential investor is Japan. The way U Aung Naing Oo sees it, “Japan is overly reliant on Chinese agri products. But if they were to diversify their agriculture import markets, Myanmar would be the most likely option. Political and economic relations are improving between Myanmar and Japan, so they can rely on us as an alternative source of food to reduce the risk of relying on a single country.”“We must encourage investors to invest in Myanmar and bring their technology to the agriculture sector so that it can grow,” said U Aung Naing Oo.","/business/27180-why-agriculture-is-ailing-and-how-best-to-revive-the-sector.html"
"95",95,"Big Four firm hails Belt and Road as a “global game changer”",2017-08-01,"Business","Foreign businesses are encouraged to join the game early to reap the long-term benefits                         A recent report from a multinational professional services firm praises China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as transcending beyond initial expectations by extensively boosting trade and commerce and supporting both physical and social infrastructures. It urged foreign businesses to join the game.          The report Repaving the Ancient Silk Routes, published by PwC Growth Markets Centre in May, hails the Belt and Road Initiative as “a global game changer”. The report is produced to showcase the opportunities for foreign businesses to be involved in the BRI and the potential risks.According to the report, the BRI transcended many of its initial impressions and has proven to be much more than offloading industrial surplus or building a road. For example, there is an emphasis on developing bankable infrastructure projects supported by large international agencies, which infers that the BRI goes beyond geopolitics and focuses on trade and investment promotion.Infrastructure ecosystemThe BRI has included the building of highways, railways, ports, airports and now even attempts to establish a maritime route that cuts through from China to Southeast Asia and beyond.Furthermore, the scheme encompasses the development of an infrastructure ecosystem ranging from power generation and utilities infrastructure, oil and gas pipelines, to telecommunications transmission cables. There will be further activities involving social infrastructure such as education and healthcare, media, software and innovation. The BRI also supports on industrial and resource cooperation to drive trade – 70 cooperative zones have already been set up.This echoes with what Jonathan Woetzel, McKinsey senior partner and McKinsey Global Institute director, as well as Bernard Chan, president of Asia Financial Holdings and grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, said regarding how the initiative will play out in Myanmar and the region.Jonathan Woetzel told The Myanmar Times that the private sector and foreign businesses, not multilateral institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, have the biggest part to play.Similarly, Bernard Chan said services, trade, tourism and other commercial opportunities will follow through after the infrastructure hardware is built. While the physical hardware is led by Chinese state-owned enterprises, the opportunities which come after the infrastructure phase will involve foreign businesses and the private sector.The report cited a few major achievements in the BRI, including the first China-UK transnational freight train, which completed its 12,450km journey, earlier in January, and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail project, for which the construction contract was signed in April.Sino-foreign partnershipsRepaving the ancient Silk Routes argued that partnerships between Chinese organisations and foreign businesses can prove to be beneficial for both sides in many ways. Gaining knowledge through foreign partnerships can help Chinese firms develop expertise, and enhance their credibility in the infrastructure sector. For foreign businesses, collaboration with Chinese companies in infrastructure projects in third party countries can help open up access to its large domestic market.Foreign businesses can partake as a private investor in projects which are risk-guaranteed by Chinese institutions, according to the report.“Successful partnership examples already exist, wherein foreign multinationals have become established equipment suppliers to Chinese engineering, procurement and construction [EPC] companies,” it said.In a typical BRI project, foreign firms are able to contribute by making connections with local stakeholders, as well as having established knowledge of managing an infrastructure project in developing markets. This helps reduce operational risks in a less familiar terrain and business environment.The authors identified three main areas of risks in the BRI: geopolitical, funding and operational. Geopolitical risks refer to changes in political regimes or in bilateral relations between countries involved in BRI during a project’s life-span. Funding risks mean funding gaps as well as host countries’ varied ability to repay loans, exacerbated by higher capital and debt service ratios of BRI projects. Operational risks are due to a lack of experience in delivering and managing complex transnational projects, leading to delays and cost overruns.Frank Lyn, markets leader at PwC in China and Hong kong, urged companies to participate at an early stage to reap rewards in the long run.“In many ways, the initiative serves as a blueprint for how China wants to further connect itself into the global economy and strengthen its influence in the region.“The initiative .. is a driver for long-term growth and expansion as well as corporate profitability. Therefore, strategically, companies need to be involved at an early stage to reap the long term benefits,” he said.Joshua Yau, lead principal in Belt and Road at PwC Strategy in China, said that China’s financial prowess would change the game in the process of constructing infrastructure abroad.“Chinese companies will increasingly bring not only their EPC capabilities, but also their financial prowess to BRI countries,” he explained.The report concluded that the BRI boasts an unprecedented scale and will drive massive infrastructure spending internationally and create opportunities which warrant foreign businesses to take part. There have already been many success cases of Sino-foreign partnerships which led to increasing demand for foreign capabilities to BRI projects. This, in turn, reaffirms that there are commercial opportunities across the infrastructure value chain.But the publication cautioned companies against venturing into infrastructure projects without fully understanding the potential risks.Establishing contingency plans to manage short-term disruptions, planning for lengthy project life-spans and establishing strong relationships with local authorities all help navigate the domestic political and local bureaucratic complications, Repaving the ancient Silk Routes suggested.","/business/27049-big-four-firm-hails-belt-and-road-as-a-global-game-changer.html"
"96",96,"UK businesses keen to help modernise Myanmar’s railways and airports",2017-07-27,"Business","UK businesses are keen to leverage their strengths and expertise to support Myanmar’s transport and infrastructure development, the UK Prime Minister’s Business Ambassador told The Myanmar Times.                         Top priorities include the intercity railway networks, Yangon’s mass rapid transit system and airports in Yangon and Mandalay.          Andrew McNaughton, the UK Prime Minister’s Business Ambassador for infrastructure, visited Myanmar in May to follow up on a scoping visit which was conducted by the UK Department of International Trade (DIT) last December, according to the DIT in Myanmar.In April, the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell sat down with The Myanmar Times to talk about the partnership between Scotland and Myanmar in the oil and gas sector.Mr McNaughton’s visit sought to further explore potential opportunities in the infrastructure projects for both the DIT and UK companies. However, due to the impending UK General Election, Mr McNaughton, as a public servant, was unable to speak to any media during his visit.Subsequently, he spoke to The Myanmar Times on July 26 about British commercial interest and capabilities in Myanmar’s infrastructure projects as well as the role of infrastructure in Myanmar’s urbanisation process. Mr McNaughton is the chief operating officer of France-based Systra Group, which is an international engineering and consulting firm specialising in rail and public transport.During the December scoping visit, a number of infrastructure projects were identified for British firms as opportunities to collaborate with local partners for direct investment, supply of technology and solutions.Mr McNaughton told The Myanmar Times that the sectors included in the follow-up visit include various parts of transportation, water and healthcare infrastructure in Myanmar.He noted that the country’s pipeline for over the next decade involves most elements across the infrastructure market and the need for investment in infrastructure development is evident. However, the top priority for British businesses in the short term would be Myanmar’s transport sector, particularly the development of railway networks and airports, with a focus on revamping Yangon’s transport landscape and connectivity between cities.The immediate opportunity for the United Kingdom to provide support would be in transport and, in particular, mass transportation rail projects and the airport development program.- Andrew McNaughton, UK Prim Minister's Business Ambassador for Infrastructure“In rail, this included the upgrade of long land intercity lines between major centres of population, such as Yangon, Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw, and the development of commuter lines for the Yangon MRT [mass rapid transit].“Specifically for the MRT in Yangon, these are urban projects seeking to both solve existing transport congestion issues and support the projected growth of the city that is projected to double [its population] to 10 million by 2040.“Therefore, it includes an upgrade of the circle line and initially two new metro lines.“There is also the planned connection to the airport,” he said, adding that the development of cross-border connections to increase international trade is a medium-term target.For the aviation transport industry, Mr McNaughton said that the immediate priority would be developing the airports in both Mandalay and Yangon.“In the airport sector, the immediate focus would be support for the development of the Mandalay International Airport and the new Hanthawaddy International Airport in Yangon.“Over the medium term, the opportunity exists to support department of civil aviation [DCA] on the regional airport development program,” he continued.A market structure which attracts international financeThe lack of investment is a major challenge for infrastructure in Myanmar and ASEAN to take off.According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), ASEAN will require US$26 trillion in investment by 2030 to meet the region’s infrastructure needs. The investment demand for infrastructure is a recurring theme repeatedly highlighted by experts and businesses. It is the key reason that businesses in the country welcome China’s Belt and Road Initiative’s (BRI), which is widely touted as an investment boost for large-scale projects. Many of the proposed infrastructure projects in the country are major schemes requiring substantial finance.Earlier this year, businessmen such as William Greenlee from DFDL, Tomoaki Yabe from Daizen Myanmar, Nick Powell from Delta Capital Myanmar and Khin Maung Win from Myan Shwe Pyi Group pointed out that the BRI represented an investment opportunity for the country’s infrastructure.“Better infrastructure is vital for a robust logistics sector. Myanmar needs more investments to get the hardware ready. We have worked with Chinese companies and more collaboration, encouraged by the BRI, is definitely good news,” Mr Yabe remarked.“At this nascent stage of infrastructure development, I would think all financing assistance would be welcome. Organisations like Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank [AIIB] and China Development Bank will be able to provide inexpensive financing to large and expensive projects,” Mr Greenlee said.In contrast, the UK is keen to leverage its strength in the professional services industry, ranging from financial and legal sectors to urban planning and taxation, in order to help Myanmar develop the legal and regulatory frameworks necessary to raise capital investments from abroad.Mr McNaughton told The Myanmar Times that the UK infrastructure services industry has the experience and expertise to support building an internationally-recognised market structure for Myanmar to attract international finance. In the short term, the focus would be to develop the legal and regulatory frameworks.“In the short term, there is work to be done to develop the legal and regulatory frameworks that will support the ability to attract international finance and project delivery“The establishment of a market structure requires significant development of regulations and legal structures to be able to establish an environment to contract with international organisations.“It also requires the establishment of robust and transparent procurement processes.“UK legal, financial and support services companies have extensive experience of working with governments around the world to establish such structures,” he added.In addition, prioritisation of the projects requires a developed process of strategic planning, in terms of catering for urbanisation and economic growth, according to the business ambassador. Such planning is needed at both the national and sub-national levels. In this area, there is significant experience which can be drawn from British specialists in the infrastructure sector.Apart from urban and economic planning, Mr McNaughton said that British technical and technological know-how in project finance and management would be particularly valuable for Myanmar’s railway and airport projects.“There is established expertise in project finance, procurement and delivery both at the project management level and for downstream products and services.“This is especially in the field of technology and specialist systems for rail and airports,” he noted.Transport and urbanisationWhen asked about the importance of infrastructure in Myanmar’s urbanisation and economy, the COO of Systra said that transport is crucial for cities to successfully accommodate urban migration, sustain inward investment and retain human capital.“Infrastructure development is essential to the Myanmar future growth and sustainability. In this regard, transport is key.“The global trend is towards urbanisation and therefore the ability for cities not only to accommodate the natural migration but to attract inward investment and talent in a globally competitive market is key. To do this, they must have efficient and effective infrastructure.“This is both economic infrastructure such as power, water and transportation, but also social infrastructure in the form of healthcare and education facilities,” he explained, adding that improving trade requires the ability to move products for export as well as having the facilities to accommodate growth in quantities.According to the business ambassador, Brexit presents more opportunities to Myanmar and the region because, upon Brexit, the UK would be able to strengthen its involvement in the region without having to take into account the views of EU countries.“From Myanmar and the ASEAN region’s perspective, there are few challenges related to Brexit and mainly opportunities.“As an outcome of the Brexit process, the UK government and individual businesses are seeking to establish long term relationships beyond the European Community. This is being done without having to consider the views of 26 other member states. This creates an agility and a momentum that can only be an advantage to the region,” he concluded.","/business/26984-uk-businesses-keen-to-modernise-myanmar-s-railways-and-airports.html"
"97",97,"Urbanisation does not mean  all roads lead to Yangon",2017-07-07,"Business","Linking secondary cities to Yangon or Mandalay as well as smaller towns in the regions will filter down economy activity in the two big cities to local regions, the author of Urban Myanmar said.                         Linking secondary cities to Yangon or Mandalay as well as smaller towns in the regions will filter down economy activity in the two big cities to local regions, the author of Urban Myanmar said.          Urban Myanmar, a policy note published by International Growth Centre, outlines how cities in Myanmar can become drivers of economic growth and how their negative effects can be avoided.The International Growth Centre (IGC) is headquartered in London but has an office in Yangon.The Myanmar Times sat down with the publication’s author, Tim Dobermann, an economist, to talk about the country’s urbanisation process andAccording to the National Spatial Development Framework drafted by the Ministry of Construction (MoC), Myanmar has three primary tier cities – Yangon, Mandalay, and Nay Pyi Taw, which serve as national strategic growth centres.The complementary nature of Mandalay and YangonYangon’s prominence in the economy is well-known – the commercial capital is leading the services sector and light export-oriented manufacturing. The country’s most successful and advanced special economic zone (SEZ), Thilawa, borders Yangon downtown.The policy note cautioned against focusing solely on developing Yangon’s economy.Its author explained that a “cascading effect” would result if only Yangon gets to grow.“One view is that if all investment and financing is focused on a single city like Yangon, then other secondary cities can miss out on attracting such investments.“If the only place to do business is Yangon, then what are the incentives for a new business to build elsewhere?“The result could be a cascading effect, where the big city – i.e. Yangon – keeps getting bigger and bigger, leaving the rest behind,” Mr Dobermann said, citing an example for workers.“If the only suitable place for jobs is in Yangon, you won’t harbour aspirations to look for work in a smaller city outside the commercial capital,” he noted.The economist emphasised that this should not be an argument on limiting the size of Yangon.“We shouldn’t approach the issue by thinking about how can we slowdown Yangon but, rather, how can we speed-up everyone else to converge or at least catch up with Yangon – how to link activity and make sure that the areas around Yangon benefit from the activity.“The emphasis would be better placed on building the links and connections between a big city like Yangon with other surrounding secondary cities and rural areas.“There is good evidence, from India for instance, that suggests that urban growth in big cities can have positive effects on reducing poverty in the countryside – provided that the cities and rural areas are linked and accessible,” he went on.For Mr Dobermann, the question boils down to how Myanmar balances the activity and growth in Yangon with the aims of reducing inequality between the rural areas and the cities.Yangon’s more service-based economy is contrasted with Mandalay’s, which is more manufacture-based with the aim to export to China.The expert told The Myanmar Times that Mandalay’s attractiveness comes from its geographical proximity to Muse and the Chinese border, and that it can further develop its surrounding regions through its connections to neighbouring areas.“Mandalay is seen as a very good hub for trade, whether it is trade between China and India or trade between central Myanmar and China. It will [also] be very tied to the development of Yangon.“You would see a lot more interaction with Chinese economy and trade, really driving some of the businesses.“At the same time, Mandalay is the regional hub for many people coming through the neighbouring states. Ultimately what is important is that Mandalay has these connections to these smaller cities around it and main connections to the big cities like Yangon,” he said.The economist added that the two cities are very complementary.“If you think of Yangon as the entry point for international investment, you can think of Mandalay as the entry point for regional investment, into northern Myanmar and south-western China. “As an investor, you might want to start in Yangon. However, if you are interested in expanding your operations to a wider Myanmar or a focus on the Chinese market, Mandalay is the regional centre for that,” he continued.Not ‘all roads lead to Yangon’There is a lot of momentum behind infrastructure investment on the connection between Mandalay and Yangon, according to Mr Dobermann.“It’s one of those key ideas in the centre of all these long-term plans,” he said, adding that both connecting Yangon and Mandalay and linking regional urban areas to the two main cities are important.“This urbanisation and connection between primary and secondary cities will become more of a concern, as questions around inequality or rural development occur,” he explained.Urban Myanmar argued that secondary cities would need to be connected with both the primary tier cities and towns in their regions, further linked by agro-industrial centres and border towns, in order to expand industrial production beyond Yangon and allow inclusive development.The economist explained that those connections require a combination of land, rail and water transport.“It’s really a combination. You’ll have the traditional highway infrastructure.“At the same time, rail infrastructure is much more efficient in terms of business – if you’re transporting a large number of goods from southern Myanmar to Mandalay into the Chinese border, the rail would be cheaper.“You need a combination of both road and rail infrastructure.“And of course, there are the waterways between Yangon and Mandalay. This is another aspect on how to boost trade within the country,” Mr Dobermann noted.Trade within Myanmar and international trade are equally important.“We often think about international trade but internal trade is just as important if you want to think about Myanmar’s development and development in the different states and regions as well,” he said.One way to think of it is like a ladder or staircase, according to Mr Dobermann. At the very top are Yangon and Mandalay, but as you move down, even though they’ve become smaller cities, they’re still a part of the entire staircase. This is the way how economic activity in the two big cities filters down into the local region – the report terms that as the evolution of urban hierarchies.“When we’re talking about connections, it’s not ‘all roads need to lead to Yangon’ but all secondary cities [in the region] need to be connected to Yangon.“You have state and region capitals which are linked up to Yangon and Mandalay and in turn those state and region capitals are linked up to their own regional towns,” he said.According to Urban Myanmar, urban areas can be productive and liveable places if policymakers address key issues such as land, transport, finance, employment, and service provision.Mr Dobermann told The Myanmar Times that apart from focusing on the long-term planning, Yangon also needs to work on more immediate reforms.“If you want to have a successful city, you are going to need to take some pretty immediate reforms and steps.“Sometimes, the conversation [regarding Yangon’s development] is not as heavily focused on these issues. In a way, the city’s long-term plan is essential.“But if you get the fundamental challenges in a city right – if you are able to establish an effective service provision, reach out to different communities and put in right regulations – these will be what makes the big difference,” he said.","/business/26714-urbanisation-does-not-mean-all-roads-lead-to-yangon.html"
"98",98,"Japanese businesses express no interest in Dawei or Kyaukphyu SEZ",2017-07-05,"Business","Interview with Katsuji Nakagawa from the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Myanmar                         Japanese businesses have not indicated any interest in Dawei SEZ or Kyaukphyu SEZ, and see the lack of reliable power supply as the biggest challenge in Myanmar, the chair of the Japanese Chamber said.          Katsuji Nakagawa, chair of Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Myanmar (JCCM) and country head of Sumitomo Corporation Group, spoke to The Myanmar Times about the concerns and development of Japanese investments and businesses on June 9 in his office.In an honest revelation, he said that Japanese companies, unlike Western firms, do not face public pressure on human rights issues, and that Japanese businesses in Myanmar have not expressed a desire to be involved in Dawei or Kyaukphyu SEZ.After the “Conflict in Myanmar: Impact on Investment and Business” panel discussion on May 30 organised by the British Chamber of Commerce Myanmar, Vicky Bowman, director of Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business told The Myanmar Times that investments in Myanmar are unlikely to be considered a reputation risk for Asian companies.“Since the Rohingya issue is increasingly the dominant newspaper story about Myanmar in the media, not just in the West but in the region, this is colouring perceptions of the country and political risk.“The difference is that Asian companies, unlike Western companies, rarely encounter shareholder and media activism on human rights, and therefore investments in Myanmar are unlikely to be considered a reputation risk for them.“The Chevron shareholders resolution which will be voted on at their annual general meeting on 31 May is an example of this. I doubt you would see such a resolution facing an Asian company,” she said.Ms Bowman was referring to the US-based Chevron resolution vote. A small number of shareholders at Chevron singled out Myanmar in a resolution vote on May 31, requesting Chevron to issue a report by the end of November 2017 examining the feasibility of adopting a policy of not doing business with the Myanmar government.The Myanmar Times asked the JCCM chair whether it is true that Japanese companies do not face the same public pressure on human rights issues.“I’ll tell you not [no]. No public pressure. No public pressure in Myanmar and no public pressure in Japan. Our headquarters in Japan also do not have the pressure,” Mr Nakagawa said.Peace process impact on business “not so big”Many commentators have argued that, given Trump’s shift in foreign policy and the reputation risks of western companies investing in Myanmar, Myanmar is tilting towards China, Japan and other Asian neighbours for investment and support. The Myanmar Times asked him whether the Japanese investment approach is different from the Chinese or other Asian countries.“I don’t see any difference. Myanmar is a new frontier market. Japanese companies are very keen to contribute to Myanmar society and to its people.“Japanese businesses understand that Myanmar is a big potential market. Historically, we have had a good relationship with Myanmar,” he said.He went on to say that, during former president U Thein Sein’s tenure, the Japanese government expected democracy and changes to take place in Myanmar, and supported private companies to venture into the market.“Japanese government and private companies have started coming back to Myanmar during the military days. This is supported and initiated by the Japanese government.“The Japanese government knew that a new Myanmar government would come in soon.“The NLD [National League for Democracy] party would win the election and a new democracy would start – the Japanese government understood and expected this prospect,” he added.Mr Nakagawa expressed his bemusement as to why the US did not lift the sanctions during U Thein Sein’s tenure.“At that time, the US still kept the sanctions on Myanmar under U Thein Sein’s government.“I don’t know why – maybe they judge the situation very strictly, or maybe they couldn’t understand the situation well.“But the Japanese government was aiming and expecting that democracy would be coming during U Thein Sein’s time,” he said.The JCCM chair explained that major sectors which Japanese businesses are involved include agriculture, construction, logistics, services, banks and insurance and heavy industries.But he added that heavy industries would take more time to develop, due to the lack of power supply and lack of clarity in regulations.Yohei Sasakawa, Nippon Foundation chair, was appointed by the Japanese government as a special envoy for national reconciliation in Myanmar to engage exclusively to facilitate the peace and reconciliation process. Tokyo has taken Myanmar’s peace process very seriously.When asked about the importance of peace process to foreign direct investment (FDI) climate, Mr Nakagawa said that the “effect” of peace is “not so big” for businesses.“Of course, it [peace process] is an important issue. It is the first [top] priority for State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.“But, for businesses, frankly, the effect is not so big,” he said, adding that the Japanese government has been very keen to support the cause and highlighting Tokyo’s humanitarian contribution.The JCCM chair also named the lack of power supply as the biggest obstacle in doing business in the country.No interest in Dawei expressedJapan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe confirmed back in 2014 he would support the economic zone, a joint project between Thailand and Myanmar that aims to link the Andaman Sea to Bangkok and the Gulf of Thailand.In February 2017, Tanintharyi Region finance minister and vice president of the Dawei special economic zone (SEZ) Management Committee U Phyo Win Tun told The Myanmar Times that Japan was becoming more interested in the project, which would likely restart soon.But there has been no specific announcement on Japan’s investment in the zone.Separately, the Myanmar government has asked the Japanese government for help in drawing up the Tanintharyi Region’s development master plan along with a comprehensive development plan for the Dawei SEZ.The JCCM chair said that the chamber is not aware of any interest from Japanese businesses regarding the Dawei project. He said Japanese companies in Thailand might be interested, but not for businesses in Myanmar.“Those companies [who have expressed an interest in Dawei] are working in Bangkok.“But here in Myanmar, at least among JCCM members, we did not have any comments like ‘oh we want to support Dawei’.“Maybe the situation is different in Bangkok. But the JCCM here does not have any comments on Dawei,” he remarked.The same applies to Kyaukphyu project, according to Mr Nakagawa.“Kyaukphyu – not so much. We have never heard of any Japanese companies supportive of Kyaukphyu,” he noted.","/business/26682-japanese-businesses-express-no-interest-in-dawei-or-kyaukphyu-sez.html"
"99",99,"Belt and Road must learn from mistakes of Myitsone Dam, says academic",2017-07-04,"Business","The success of China’s Belt and Road scheme hinges on whether Beijing can learn from the mistakes of Myitsone Dam and engage with Myanmar on an equal basis, the chair of a Singapore-based think tank told The Myanmar Times.           Following the 2nd ASEAN-Myanmar Forum hosted by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA) in Sedona Hotel on June 28, Simon Tay, SIIA chair, sat down with The Myanmar Times for an exclusive interview. The Myanmar Times previously covered part of the interview on the China-led Kyaukphyu project.Lee is conspicuous by his absence in BRI meetingIn mid-May, China’s decision not to invite Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing reflects the tension between the two countries following a few diplomatic fallouts last year. Mr Lee’s conspicuous absence is the odd one out in the region: the presidents of the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and Laos as well as the prime ministers of Cambodia and Malaysia were invited and attended the summit meeting.But investment figures suggest another picture.Over 60 percent of Chinese overseas direct investment (ODI) flows to BRI countries in 2013 –15 were directed to ASEAN countries, with the lion city attracting by far the largest share, according to think-tank The Economist Intelligence Unit.“That investment [to Singapore] is unlikely to be related to the core infrastructure-development purpose of the BRI, and will have more to do with the attractions of the Singaporean business environment,” the think tank noted.The Myanmar Times asked Mr Tay about the discrepancy between China’s diplomatic gesture and investment figures. He suggested that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the silver lining in the cloud – the only piece of good news in a time where uncertainties and chaos plague different parts of the world.“First, the Chinese must be congratulated. If you look at the world today, it is like a weather with grey clouds and there’s no sunshine anywhere. And that one spot of sunlight in the grey sky is the BRI. For Europeans and Americans, there isn’t really any positive news.“The BRI idea could be very big. It’s good for businesses, good for people and good for cooperation. So this is the positive side.“Every country in this region likes infrastructure … but we cannot undertake infrastructure alone,” he said.The lessons from Myitsone DamThe BRI idea is good. The tricky part, according to Mr Tay, is the implementation.“Even if you have a good idea, implementation is the key. And then implementation has concerns. We have some question marks over China,” he said.The academic mentioned that the Myitsone Dam is a valuable lesson for China and Myanmar. He said the issue is that China wanted a dam built in Myanmar with most of the power generated going to China. But most of the environmental and social problems would have remained in Myanmar.“During another forum in Thailand, I mentioned Myitsone Dam. When China was supporting Myanmar’s development earlier, they wanted the Myitsone Dam, where most of the power would have gone to China. But most problems would have stayed here.“How can this be good for Myanmar?“The previous and current [Myanmar] governments are right to stop the project and not restart it in the same way. So can a dam or a road be good? It depends on how you do it,” he said.The BRI must prove that the implementation is done in the right way, Mr Tay went on. China needs to illustrate how benefits are mutual.“There is the mutual benefit and it will have some pollution, and some people will have to move houses. But we need to minimise the problems.“When we look at China [China’s approach] on development, it likes communism and does not care about people. They [China] want to build a dam and they just move the people. They give compensation to farmers but when the farmers get the actual money, the amount is so little.“These are all documented by various international sources.“What China needs to do on the BRI is show mutual benefit. In a few countries that have been successful, in a way the success story can be told. Myanmar and Thailand will be good partners for China. Because Thailand is not a small country, it is not so weak but it does need help. But then China must do partners,” he noted.For China, Myanmar used to be the same as North KoreaDespite China’s snub on Singapore’s prime minister, Mr Tay believed the relationship between the two countries is “very good”.“But sometimes, with such a good relationship, you expect more. Sometimes, China doesn’t know where the line is.“In terms of politics, China is so big. Even if China is not trying to dominate you, it is. It just happens like a big guy who enters a room and takes up a lot of space. That’s China or America,” he said.Three quarters of Singapore’s population are ethnic Chinese and hence China expected the city state to follow the line very closely, he explained. On the issue of the South China Sea, he said the Singaporean government merely pointed out the relevant law.“So China didn’t invite my prime minister but I think we mustn’t care too much. We want to have good relationship for itself but a good relationship takes two people to understand. If China just said ‘everything I say is right and you must say is right’. That’s not a good relationship.“For Myanmar, until U Thein Sein’s government, China was treating Myanmar like how it treated North Korea. They really expected Myanmar to follow everything they wanted.“Now ... there must be a more equal relationship. But this is a big step for China,” he remarked, saying that China must be able to work with others on an equal basis.In dealing with big powers such as the US and China, Mr Tay emphasised that Myanmar should prioritise collective diplomacy as a member of ASEAN.“Being from ASEAN, one of the questions for me is to always think about how we work as a group.“Everyone in this group, whether it is a small country like Singapore or big countries like Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam, realises that ten is better than anyone. I hope Myanmar understands that.“China, America or Japan is always very important. But working as ten countries is always better than working as one. At first it was not clear whether the NLD-led government understood this.“To be fair to them, when they went to opposition and when they went in jail, some of their neighbours did nothing. So, in this sense, there is no natural friendship.“People were worried that the way Myanmar can try to go on their own, which is not good for ASEAN and not good for Myanmar either. Now we are more assured because The Lady has turned up everywhere with ASEAN which is good, if ASEAN can work together,” he went on.The academic said that for both political reasons and business interests, he hopes Myanmar can see the benefit for being part of ASEAN.“Of course, ASEAN very much welcomes Myanmar, the new Myanmar. The previous Myanmar always had problems with the politics, Western sanctions and business issues because the government closed the economy,” the SIIA chair concluded.","/business/26665-belt-and-road-must-learn-from-mistakes-of-myitsone-dam-says-academic.html"
"100",100,"Politics aside, Belt and Road is Asia’s medicine: PwC",2017-06-30,"Business","The political will and financial resources from China’s Belt and Road Initiative will help Myanmar and Asia to fill the infrastructure demand, according to the managing director of professional services firm PwC Myanmar.                         During the 2nd ASEAN-Myanmar Forum hosted by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs on June 28 in Sedona Hotel, The Myanmar Times interviewed Ong Chao Choon, managing director of PwC Myanmar, Jovi Seet, senior executive director of mergers and acquisitions and Paul Cornelius, who’s in charge of tax.          Mr Ong told The Myanmar Times that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides the much-needed political will and financial support for Myanmar and Asia’s infrastructure thirst.“If we take away the politics, the Belt and Road is probably the medicine that most of Asia needs.“Asia has a huge infrastructure gap of trillions upon trillions of dollars. If you look at the numbers published by the World Bank and other institutions, the numbers from 10 years ago are the same today.“One of the issues why this gap has not been filled is due to the lack of the will to do it and the money to do it. What the BRI has is someone who is pushing it and someone who provides the finances. In Thailand, Laos, Malaysia, projects are being built, and Myanmar is on the map.“Having said that, the BRI will have a political element to it because it is a G-to-G [government to government] initiative.“It will provide much needed infrastructure – if you do not have the proper infrastructure, all the advantages of a low-labour-cost base will be eaten up by the inefficiency of transport and logistics costs,” he said.Additionally, the managing director was upbeat about Kyaukphyu.“The biggest project is the test case [of the BRI] and we hope to see it breaking ground in the next six to 12 months, for the Kyaukphyu project.“That is an investment in a part of Myanmar that really needs investment, one of the poorer parts of Myanmar – Rakhine State.“The Kyaukphyu project will do a lot of good to Rakhine State and Myanmar as a whole,” he noted.The interview touched upon many other issues.Citing the telecom sector as an example, Mr Seet said that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities are largely driven by what the Myanmar government has done to liberalise individual sectors.“The first to liberalise was the telecom sector, bringing in all those foreign operators who can own their business 100 percent. That generated a lot of interest.“A lot of other M&A activities followed through in a downstream [direction], including the telecom tower space. We are seeing activities catalysed by what the government has done to open up the sectors.The M&A director added that the change brought by the new investment law is two-fold.“On the one hand, there is a lot of simplification in terms of granting permits to operate and the access of a longer term for land [leasing],” he said, adding that these changes are helpful as many international companies are keen to have joint ventures and have the ability to own or lease land for a long term. On the other hand, the changes in tax incentives and restricted areas for foreign investment present uncertainty for foreign investors.“A number of businesses are looking to get approval, whether to enter certain restricted sectors or to get tax incentives.“A lot of incentives are now subject to the Myanmar Investment Commission’s [MIC’s] judgment, as opposed to previously when everything was straightforward – every single application was given a five-year tax break. This has created a bit of uncertainty for parties and it takes time to learn,” he said.After a long period of wait-and-see approach under the new government, investors in general are still waiting for clearer policies and more details. On the bright side, M&A activities are gathering steam and things are moving faster than a year ago, according to Mr Seet.“There isn’t really a trigger for the speed of investment to happen in the past 12 months. A lot of the investors, who were sitting on the fence before and during the change of government leadership, are still eyeing the market.“Now investors are observing how the new government is able to introduce new policies and how they are embracing investments. It’s still wait-and-see.“For activities, there seems to be a bit of movement with some projects which have started moving – Kyaukphyu SEZ – and there are a number of M&A projects that we are working on where MIC approval tends to be put on the backburner but is now gathering some steam.“Since April this year, things seem to be moving faster than last year,” he said.Mr Cornelius added that there are now more areas in which foreign investments can enter.“The government is actually liberalising the areas and businesses can come in – which was impossible in the past. But now large retail developments will be possible,” he said.One main challenge for mergers or acquisitions, beyond the legislative restriction, is the gap between domestic and international businesses in valuation process, company structure and corporate governance.“One of the challenges is that there tends to be a period of time for foreign investors to understand the Myanmar environment and for Myanmar companies to understand foreign investment expectations.“When that gap is too big, M&A becomes difficult – harmonisation takes time. However, shared values will transcend commercial terms that can help overcome these obstacles,” he said, citing the example of responsible investment and community contribution as values which could help bridge the gap.Another challenge is the corporate governance, or lack of that, in Myanmar companies and the expectations from foreign investors, according to Mr Ong.“A lot of Myanmar companies are run by patriarchs or old entrepreneurs whose businesses have lasted for twenty or thirty years.“He [the old entrepreneur] is used to making decisions centrally. The company is not big so he can actually decide centrally.“Now you bring in a foreign partner and you need to bring in corporate governance, delegate authority and you have things which are decided by somebody else.“This is a cultural shift, but it is a shift that Myanmar companies need to go through anyway, whether it is joint venture or passing down the business to the next generation or the business growing beyond its current size,” he said.Other major issues affecting the M&A sector include the integrity of financial numbers, the level of detail of financial information, and the valuation expectation and gap. Foreign investors look for accurate and detailed information on the financial position of local businesses, which is an expectation that many local companies do not share.“Foreign investors might come in fairly disciplined in terms of looking at things such as financial model and so on.“The local investor will have a different expectation on what the assets or the business is worth. If you cannot match that gap, then it’s very hard for M&A to happen,” Mr Ong said.The interviewees also said that Asian investors are more dominant in this market than Western ones, with Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and China taking the lead. Increasingly, more Chinese private businesses, as opposed to state-owned enterprises, are entering the market.During another interview, Yotaro Agari, general manager of planning division for Asia and Oceania at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG) told The Myanmar Times that the MUFG is ""optimistic"" on the BRI and ""willing to participate"" in funding BRI-led projects in Myanmar.""We also like to capture the business opportunity arising from this Belt and Road Initiative, here in Myanmar and in other places. But here in Myanmar we haven't had one yet,"" he said.Asked whether he is optimistic on the BRI, he replied ""we are optimistic and we are willing to participate.""","/business/26624-politics-aside-belt-and-road-is-asia-s-medicine-pwc.html"
"101",101,"Agricultural exports still rely on neighbouring markets",2017-06-21,"Nay Pyi Taw","Myanmar has been trying to expand agricultural products to international markets including Europe and the United States after US sanctions were removed and also with EU’s trade privileges but Myanmar still relies on neighbouring markets, said Commerce’s Deputy Minister U Aung Htoo.           Since the former government’s term, Myanmar has sought to expand the export of agricultural products to US as well as Europe, Japan and South Korea. But so far, it still mainly relies on neighbouring countries and therefore, the risks also remain.“Agricultural products have to rely on two or three neighbouring markets, that is why many in the export industry have encountered risks when changes happen in those markets,” he told Pyithu Hluttaw on June 16.Although he did not name the countries, they are likely to be China, Thailand and India, said Ko Nay Soe, a rice miller from Nay Pyi Taw.“China buys rice and other crops and so does Thailand. India buys beans and pulses in particular,” he said. He added that in particular, there is a Chinese influence on Myanmar’s agricultural products.“Our country mainly exports rice and China handles the rice market. Myanmar also exports rice to other countries but the main market is China. Therefore, the domestic rice market gets hurt when Chinese traders speculate on the market,” he said. There are some opportunities to explore new markets for agricultural products but the deputy minister said price, quality and quantity, to supply in time according to the market demand, remains a challenge.“The export market is flourishing but there are also challenges for Myanmar’s agricultural products as crop yield per acre is very low, production cost is high, quality fails to meet international standards, stock, transportation and distribution are expensive,” said U Aung Htoo.However, Myanmar has started exporting beans and sesames to countries like Japan, Korea and Singapore.With five objectives, the ministry has been implementing a mid-term trade development plan to achieve stable overseas markets. Under this plan, if there is more cooperation between farmers and exporters, the crop market can be stronger, he added. In other words, if the country produces good-quality crops in closer cooperation between farmers and traders, the overseas market will be strong.A Pyithu Hluttaw MP, U Sein Win from Maubin township, Ayeyarwady Region, told The Myanmar Times that he is not satisfied with government’s work on the agricultural sector which is the main source of livelihood for people in rural areas.“What the deputy minister said is good theoretically. But it also needs to cater to the real situation. It is time to improve the life of farmers by working practically,” he said.Local farmers face difficulties as most of them haven’t received the farmlands that have been seized, crop markets tends to be unstable, difficulty in seeking capital investment and cultivation is lost when weather changes, he said.“Myanmar is second most vulnerable to climate change in ASEAN so I want the government to prioritise the agricultural sector to make sure that crop cultivation is able to resist weather changes,” he said.A farmer, U Myo Win from Nay Pyi Taw’s Pyinmana township said weather changes and an unstable market are major challenges. “When it floods, crops planted get either partially or completely ruined. Even if all the crops were not destroyed, they may face an unstable market and relatively low prices. If it happens, farmers can’t get on their feet again,” he said.The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation has been trying to export high-value finished products by leapfrogging a stage of raw exports to improve farmers’ income. “Our ministry is trying to produce more agricultural products. And with foreign financial assistances like Japanese loan, we’re also trying to support farmers in producing high-value products, instead of raw products,” said the ministry’s deputy permanent secretary, U Myo Tint Tun.In 2016-17 financial year, 6.49 million tonnes of agricultural products worth US$2.928 billion were exported, said U Aung Htoo.Translation by Zar Zar Soe","/national-news/nay-pyi-taw/26483-agricultural-exports-still-rely-on-neighbouring-markets.html"
"102",102,"Affordable and quality education at Kings International School",2017-06-16,"EduCentre","As Myanmar’s economic situation improves with foreign direct investment gradually flowing in, international schools catering to kids of high-income parents and foreign businessmen have been sprouting up all over Yangon. These schools, where more and more students are now enrolled, started to appear after 2012, and now there are over a dozen international schools already being opened.          Choosing a truly unique school with an affordable price and good facilities is a great challenge for parents and elders. To make things easier for them, The Myanmar Times has picked for this month’s EduCentre an excellent international school with a moderate price for everyone.Located at 695, Maha Bandoola Street in downtown Yangon’s Latha township, Kings International School has a pre-school, a primary school and an independent International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) school.Kings International’s pre-school is suitable for Pre-Nursery kids (age 2) to Reception (ages 4-5). The primary school is for Year 1 (age 5) to Year 7 (age 12) and the standalone IGCSE program is for Year 10 and Year 11 students wishing to sit for UK’s IGCSE exams.Vital investment in young childrenThe emotional, social and physical development of young children has a direct impact on their overall development and growth. The need to invest in these young children is vital as it would shape a child’s future happiness, health, growth, development and learning achievement at their school, in their family and community, and in life in general.Neurological research shows that the early years of a child play a key role in their brain development and the first three years of life are a period of incredible growth in all areas of a baby’s development.U Ye Thiha Thant, founder and CEO of Kings International School, said, “We started opening a pre-nursery class for 2-year-old toddlers and trained them in all necessary skills to make them outstanding and successful since their very young age. We follow the standards and expectations set out by the British National Curriculum and include all subjects from it.“Moreover, as a school that is based in Myanmar, we have a strong ethos to educate our students in Myanmar language up to a high level. We have high expectations of our local students to be as fluent in Myanmar language as they are in English. This is sometimes not the case for many of the local students in international schools.“Furthermore, we also provide an opportunity for all our students to learn Chinese as a second language, as it is increasingly becoming a global language. This immersion in trilingual environment starts from pre-school and continues all the way to the end of primary school. For example, in pre-school, we would have numeracy and literacy classes in both English and Myanmar.”Very strong foundation skillsAlthough the results are not immediately visible at Pre-Nursery, they are very encouraging by the time the young students reach Reception and Year 1 stages. Music, ICT, sports are also part of the regular curriculum.“By now, they have developed very strong foundation skills in all the areas of the curriculum as well as having English and Myanmar as their core languages and Chinese as the second language. They would be reading chapter books at that age, which is incredible, and their Myanmar language ability at age 5+ is at least one or two years ahead of their peer groups,” explained U Ye Thiha Thant.“One could imagine, if they can do all these skills at such a young age, what they would be doing at age 10 or 12. At Primary School, our focus is very strong on English, Mathematics and Science. All of this is made possible because of our team of dedicated local and foreign teachers,” he said.Kings International has also launched STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) as an enrichment program beginning this summer.“As part of this program, we will be teaching Robotics to our primary school students. This program is designed by the world-renowned Carnegie Mellon University from the United States for primary and secondary school students, and has 10 different levels that are very well structured. It is currently taught in over 10,000 schools in the United States and we are very happy to bring this to our students here.“City College Yangon will be conducting this program in conjunction with our school. As the term STEM goes, we believe that giving students such access will really help them develop skills in this area,” U Ye Thiha Thant added.Developing a love of readingKings International teaches phonics, an unfamiliar topic for many Myanmar parents, in pre-school. Phonics is the foundation for young children to learn how to read and develop a love of reading from a young age.“The pre-school curriculum is based on UK’s Early Years Foundation Stage [EYFS] because Myanmar doesn’t have a comprehensive pre-school curriculum yet. The advantage of EYFS is that it is very comprehensive, very detailed and covers systematically many of the development areas of a child, and we believe that it is extremely important for our young children to have solid foundation skills,” he said.EYFS has seven areas of learning and development:•  communication and language,•  physical development,•  personal, social and emotional development,•  literacy,•  mathematics,•  understanding the world, and•  expressive arts and design.“Within each of the seven areas, there are very specific standards set for the development of each child and our program has lots of experiences and activities for our children, in addition to the trilingual environment that they are growing up in,” he added.“We use play-based learning and our program has lots of fun and interesting activities and experiences for our children to explore. Our classrooms are set up to promote creativity and curiosity while providing them a safe and friendly environment to develop their skills,” said the founder of the school.“We have a multi-purpose court that is laid with artificial grass. It gets used a lot by our students and our pre-schoolers also have a large outdoor play, although we are based in downtown Yangon. We like to think that there is a lot of creativity happening around Kings International from pre-school to primary levels. Our classrooms and the work that our children have done, that is on display around the school, is a testament to the creativity of our children,” he added.There are 130 students at Kings International School this year with 30 dedicated local teachers and five expatriates.Further study options“After IGCSE, most of our students embark on overseas trips for further study options. This is, sometimes, because there are not many alternatives here that will enable them to get into the best universities. We have had many of our students enter top universities, such as University of Oxford, Imperial College London, London School of Economics and Political Science and University College London.“We work very closely with Imperial Merit Educational Advisory in helping and counseling students and their parents on overseas study options. Through counseling, we are able to inspire and get students to set high expectations and standards for themselves. We would like our students to become very successful and are prepared to do whatever we can to help them achieve this,” U Ye Thiha Thant said.“If a student wishes to attend Myanmar schools via Kings International, we make arrangements for them to sit for the government exams. They can also sit for the government’s matriculation exam and attend the Myanmar universities,” he added.“School fees for a student will be K3 million to K6 million per year. This would be an affordable price for many parents, although we have opened Kings International at a good downtown location,” the school founder explained.There is also a weekend Young Learners Program in which English and Chinese languages are being taught to students, from public or private schools, who are seeking to improve their skills and sit for the Cambridge Young Learners exam.","/special-features/231-educentre/26427-affordable-and-quality-education-at-kings-international-school.html"

The lands have been seized twice, between May 1996 and September 1997. According to records the compensation for the seizures were nearly finished, regional MP for Salingyi town Dr Thein Naing told The Myanmar Times.“The NLD government gets the legacy from the past government. When we tried to take the compensation case, we just check with the land record from the town as well as the land seizure map at the time. Some lands are not included in the map, but they have a land record number like Lala 39. We just negotiate with the company. The company has agreed to give compensation for these. What we need to negotiate is the land cases inside the fences. Though lands are seized, there is still farming. For these cases, we have to discuss with the 27 farmers who work the lands,” Dr Thein Naing told The Myanmar Times on June 12.More than 6000 acres from the area should receive compensation according to the 2012-13 government report. “As soon as we finish discussions with those farmers, we can give the compensation as they want.”Ko Tint Aung Soe from the Kan Kone village from Salingyi town told The Myanmar Times on June 11 that he felt impatience for the delay.“Sometimes I feel that their work is only for show, always saying that they need approval from the Union.”Like Wanbo, Myanmar Yang Tse, which was established in 2011 with an investment of 1.3 billion Yuan, has been having issues with locals for the land seizures and environmental issues for example court cases.The Sabetaung and Kyisintaung mine was developed by Canadian firm Ivanhoe Mines in cooperation with the government, but sold to Wanbao after Ivanhoe pulled out of the country to pursue interests in Mongolia.In May 2015, locals accused the company of failing to follow the ‘Sustainability & Strategy Reports for Safety, Health and Environment’ in resolving land conflicts, environmental degradation, and local development issues.The locals also wanted the company to provide reimbursements, employ temporary staff as full-time employees, audit and investigate how the annual US$500,000 regional development fund had been used, and to hold a trilateral meeting involving the government, the locals and the company.They also demanded the company administer acid drop by drop instead of spraying during copper production to protect the environment, to build walls to prevent polluted air from reaching the villages, and to establish a self-managed village fund.In August 2016, they received a reply that the regional government was taking responsibility over the land compensation. The locals told the authorities that compensation for the land must be according to current market price.They have since taken some time to gather and verify land records, as the land originally owned by the farmers were not documented when the properties were seized.It is learnt that the records on the confiscated land were sent to the President and State Counsellor’s offices on April 3. And then a protest took place on April 26 when locals from Sabaetaung and Kyay Sin Taung – where the company was mining copper -- demanded that the land seizure issue be solved.The unsolved mining problem was then carried to the NLD government which could not satisfy the locals, as the NLD had taken over administration for more than one year. A number of protests against Wanbo and Yansi had also occurred in the NLD government.Even the regional government tried to keep in touch with the community, as the locals demanded their wants be fulfilled. U Thein Naing pointed out the current laws that need to be repaired if the locals demand it.“There is the land case in Wanbo, where the local want the crop from about 1900 acres, but we couldn’t give this according to the farming law in August 2012.","/national-news/mandalay-upper-myanmar/26353-land-compensation-issue-remains-unresolved.html"

The BRI is an answer to a wide range of serious domestic problems China is facing, such as a strong increase in wages, a big drop in export to its traditional markets, severe industrial overcapacity and the issue of where to invest its enormous foreign exchange reservesThe BRI tries to address these problems by turning China’s economic policy from a traditionally defensive policy into a more offensive mercantilism. It does so by aligning its industrial export chain in a more cooperative and politically coordinated way. This also explains why many European member state leaders have been very sceptical about the BRI. Different studies from the EU’s leading think-tank on this topic, the Brussels Institute of Contemporary China Studies, reveal some staggering numbers: the studies demonstrate how Europe’s market share decreased substantially in the BRI-partner countries and, in terms of high-tech goods, the numbers are even more dramatic – reducing that share by 50 percent in one decade.In terms of services, the BRI is just a beginning and it will open big market shares in its partner countries in the field of contracted projects such as construction, engineering, power and telecom. This will be backed by Beijing’s aim to set the terms of trade and determine technical and environmental standards that are more in line with China’s domestic ones. This enables China to compete effectively in the ‘partner countries’ as opposed to the current situation where one needs to apply international standards which the EU, Japan, the US and the rest of the world adhere to.Representing Europe’s business interests through EuroCham, I advise Myanmar and businesses to be cautious instead of embracing the BRI blindly. The BRI does offer many countries some growth opportunities, but only when applied critically. In the long term, staying more neutral and not serving uncritically one or two foreign interests can keep Myanmar in a much better bargaining position, enabling it on a case-by-case basis to get the best deal for its people. Also, by keeping diverse economic interests secured in the country, and by not relying too strongly on one foreign player, political flexibility and manoeuvrability – the capacity to address unexpected changes in the global sphere of trade and investment – will assure Myanmar a better, more sustainable and balanced economic development.","/business/26293-european-chamber-chief-voices-scepticism-against-the-bri.html"
"105",105,"What do local and international businesses make of the Belt and Road?",2017-06-07,"Business","Businesses in Myanmar generally welcome the Belt and Road Initiative’s (BRI) investment boost for the country’s infrastructure development.                         Businesses in Myanmar generally welcome the Belt and Road Initiative’s (BRI) investment boost for the country’s infrastructure development.           Some urged Myanmar to be more proactive in navigating its involvement in the scheme. Many emphasised the importance of transparency, public engagement and adhering to international practices. But some have also expressed reservation and scepticism against China’s ambitious scheme.Last month, the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation attracted the largest number of foreign dignitaries to the Chinese capital since the 2008 Olympic Games. Launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 as “One Belt, One Road”, the scheme involves China underwriting billion-dollar investments, mainly in infrastructure, in countries along the old Silk Road and new routes, creating an extensive trade network by linking Asia, Europe and Africa. The financial commitment illustrates the ambition: China is spending roughly US$150 billion a year in the 68 countries which have signed on to the project. The China Development Bank alone has earmarked $890 billion for some 900 projects.The Myanmar Times interviewed Jonathan Woetzel, McKinsey senior partner and McKinsey Global Institute director, as well as Bernard Chan, president of Asia Financial Holdings and grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, on how the BRI will play out in Myanmar and the region.Political analysts and commentators have argued that China is ready to ensure a politically stable environment for its southwestern region, which is a core part of the BRI. This explains China’s political involvement in Myanmar’s peace process.Now that the political aspect is unfolding gradually, The Myanmar Times asked businesses from various countries and sectors for their views of the BRI.Good news for infrastructure but Myanmar should be more proactiveNick Powell, managing partner of Delta Capital Myanmar and director of Simon Murray & Company (SMC), a pan-Asian investment company, highlighted that projects should be commercially viable and look into precedence in other parts of Asia where those infrastructure projects succeeded.“China’s BRI is a good opportunity for Myanmar and its infrastructure challenges. China is a leader in financing and building infrastructure across the spectrum. What the government needs to be cautious of are possible political motives and potential leverage this could give China Inc.“The best way to mitigate this is to make sure these projects stand on purely commercial basis, and that the operators and financiers will be paid back over the agreed term and the assets transferred to Myanmar. There are plenty examples of where it has worked, such as in Asia, and where it has not, such as in Africa,” he said.Infrastructure is a recurring theme highlighted by many businesspersons, including Khin Maung Win, CEO of Myanmar Shwe Pyi Tractors, who said that Myanmar should be proactive in defining its role in the scheme. He also stressed that public engagement for the projects and transparency were crucial“The BRI is complementary to Myanmar’s strategic national interests specifically in trade, energy needs and closing infrastructure gap. Myanmar stands to gain greatly from this initiative and should take the lead in defining its role and purpose in the BRI.“Early public engagement is critical as from past experience, commercial gains from such cooperation, albeit smaller scale, were rarely transparent,” he said. Tomoaki Yabe, managing director of Daizen Myanmar, said that the BRI represented a boost in investments for the country’s infrastructure development. More notably, he also highlighted how, by building on the experience of Thilawa SEZ, BRI-related investments and projects can genuinely benefit the country and its private sector.“Better infrastructure is vital for a robust logistics sector. Myanmar needs more investments to get the hardware ready. We have worked with Chinese companies and more collaboration, encouraged by the BRI, is definitely good news.“Only with the technologies, sufficient investment and a sound framework which aligns with the international standard can Myanmar realise its geographical potential as the regional hub.“Thilawa Special Economic Zone is a strong example illustrating how foreign direct investments, foreign technologies and local manpower can create employment opportunities and deliver significant economic growth. If Kyaukpyu and other BRI-led projects can build on the lessons of Thilawa SEZ and offer opportunities inclusive of local and international businesses, Myanmar will certainly benefit from the scheme,” he said.Similarly, William Greenlee, managing director of DFDL’s Myanmar office and also American Chamber of Commerce Myanmar’s legal committee chair, told The Myanmar Times that the financing resulting from the scheme, as long as it was commercially sound and responsible, should be embraced with open arms.“The BRI is a great opportunity for Myanmar. At this nascent stage of infrastructure development, I would think all financing assistance would be welcome. Organisations like Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank [AIIB] and China Development Bank will be able to provide inexpensive financing to large and expensive projects. This is a huge benefit as, of course, financing such projects is the first big hurdle.“And like such financing from other countries, as long as the relevant projects are commercially viable and environmentally and socially responsible, financing from China under this initiative should be welcomed with open arms,” he said.Others echoed the need for Myanmar to take an active part of the collaboration, instead of being reactionary. Ken Tun, chief executive officer of Parami Energy, said the country should realise its strategic importance in both land and maritime aspect of the BRI and be quick to act.“Myanmar signed five agreements during the Beijing summit including the Belt and Road framework on cooperation and the issue of border trade. Myanmar plays a strategic role in both the land and maritime part of the BRI.“It is important that Myanmar should push for proactive policies for BRI collaboration, particularly when other countries have already geared up to benefit from being part of the BRI,” he said.Aye Thiha, the head of Thiha Group who is also chair of government affairs committee at the American Chamber, said the BRI would unlock Myanmar’s geographical advantage.“I would very much welcome the BRI as it would unlock the full potential of Myanmar’s ideal geographic location between the economic powerhouses, China and India.“Once clearly defined with a specific timeline, the Initiative will also fill up the much needed infrastructure gap and provide Myanmar better connectivity with the rest of the world.“In my humble opinion, the risks of such an initiative are overshadowed by the economic benefits,” he said.Foreign chambers weigh inWhen asked about whether the BRI is a valuable opportunity for Myanmar to fill the infrastructure gap, Paul Wilson, president of American Chamber of Commerce Myanmar and managing director of US-owned investment company Four Rivers, said, “As a country with significant development needs, we think it reasonable for Myanmar to explore multiple options of investment and partnerships.”In terms of the reaction of American businesses in the country, Mr Wilson was keen to raise the issue of business ethics and labour standards.“The US business community in Myanmar is committed to supporting inclusive economic growth and responsible investment. US companies are proud to bring the highest standards of business ethics and labour standards to emerging markets. “Our expectation is that these high standards raise the bar for other international businesses and investors, which we believe is positive for the Myanmar government and people,” he said.Katsuji Nakagawa, chair of Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Myanmar and country head of Sumitomo Corporation Group in Myanmar, conceded that Myanmar had to depend on China for both the economy and national peace. Japanese businesses will be observing how the dynamics change and will also take into account other factors, such as US policy toward China.“China has now expressed their policy to positively get involved in the peace process between Myanmar’s national armed forces and ethnic armed groups. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi seems to have no other choices but to depend on China to stabilise the long-continued conflict in northern Myanmar.“Under the BRI, Myanmar will rely on China not only for their economic growth by China’s development assistance, but also for solving their internal affairs. Japanese businesses will continue to carefully observe how China and Myanmar relationship would be strengthened.“In addition, we, Japan, think it is necessary to closely watch the future direction and movement of the BRI, including the ramification caused by the possible shift of the US policy toward China and we will need to plot our business strategy properly,” he said.In contrast, Peter Beynon, chair of British Chamber of Commerce Myanmar, sounded more upbeat and less circumspect, highlighting the necessity for Myanmar to carve out its part in the BRI.""My thoughts are generally positive as long as Myanmar is able to retain value within its economy.""In the short term, this will mean its ability to negotiate a significant portion of an involvement in the construction of the BRI.""In the medium to long term, there will be increased trade volumes, investment and business potential for the country. This should be significant.""There is a concern at the impact on communities who will be moved and livelihoods altered, but this is inevitable and people resist change. I am positive,"" he said.The European Chamber executive director Filip Lauwerysen has also written to The Myanmar Times on his input.","/business/26292-what-do-local-and-international-businesses-make-of-the-belt-and-road.html"
"106",106,"Investor-friendly environment and human capital essential for Myanmar’s success in the Belt and Road Initiative",2017-06-05,"Business","The Belt and Road Initiative: interview with Jonathan Woetzel, McKinsey senior partner and MGI director                         Jonathan Woetzel, senior partner of McKinsey & Company and director of the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), told The Myanmar Times that success of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Myanmar would depend on the country creating an investor-friendly environment and developing sufficient human capital.          In July 2016, McKinsey predicted that the future of trade in Asia could depend heavily on China’s expansive Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which called for massive investment in and development of trade routes in the region.According to Kevin Sneader, McKinsey’s chair in Asia, the BRI has the potential to be the world’s largest platform for regional collaboration. There are two parts to the scheme: the belt and the road. The belt is the physical road, which takes one from China all the way through Europe to somewhere up north in Scandinavia. That is the physical road. What the Chinese government calls the road is in fact the maritime Silk Road, in other words, shipping lanes, essentially from China to Venice. The ambitious scheme covers about 65 percent of the world’s population, about one-third of the world’s GDP, and about a quarter of all the goods and services the world moves. The core of all these is an extensive trading network.Given its geographical proximity, ASEAN is an important player in this scheme. According to Mr Sneader, for example, the Indonesians are clearly excited about how is this going to play out. Jakarta Globe reported that Indonesia sought to draw up to US$28 billion worth of investment from Chinese investors from hundreds of projects put on the table during the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing last month.Despite all the discussions and hype surrounding the scheme, in Myanmar there has not been much information or clarity about how the BRI is going to make a difference, apart from some developments in Kyaukphyu.On June 1, The Myanmar Times interviewed Jonathan Woetzel, senior partner of McKinsey & Company and Asia-based director of the McKinsey Global Institute about the BRI, its implementation obstacles, its finances and its priorities in Myanmar. He is an expert on many China-related issues, including the BRI and the country’s urbanisation development.First of all, it is unclear who is running the initiative. Every province has its own BRI investment plan, as do hundreds of SOEs. Mr Woetzel said there wasn’t one single person in charge of the scheme. The leadership in Beijing has set out the vision but most of the actual project is implemented by individual provinces, regions and companies.“There is a One Belt One Road office associated with National Development Reform Commission. But it’s much more of a coordinator and a facilitator than a decision-maker. That is very typical of China’s central government management: They set the idea out, they try to set up institutions to support the idea, but then they allow most of the project development and initiative to become bottom-up,” he said.The MGI’s report China’s role in the next phase of globalisation published in April 2017, of which Mr Woetzel is a joint-author, suggests that the country has opportunities to build on the momentum of the BRI by placing its capital and expertise into international infrastructure projects. Bernard Chan, grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, late founder of Bangkok Bank, also told The Myanmar Times that infrastructure, and specifically Chinese state-owned enterprises-led infrastructure development, would be the scheme’s priority at this stage.But the McKinsey expert pointed out that most of the investments made across the economy would be made through industry and manufacturing because there was more activity. Infrastructure has bigger numbers in terms of investments for large-scale projects. However, the big picture would not be dominated by infrastructure.“Even China understands that investing in infrastructure, by itself, doesn’t get you anything – it doesn’t do anything for an economy, only economic activity does that.“There’s going to be at least as much investment in developing economic activity as there will be in infrastructure, largely made by large companies and not by state-owned enterprises,” he explained.The lion’s share of funding from the private sectorThe BRI region, including Myanmar, has been promised a significant boost in the financing available for infrastructure development. But the plethora of institutions is confusing: the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Silk Road Fund, the China Development Bank, the Export and Import Bank of China and many organisations. In terms of outstanding loans or equity investment by the end of 2016, the big four state-owned commercial banks had provided $150 billion, China Development Bank $110 billion, the Silk Road Fund $4 billion, Export-Import Bank of China $24 billion and the AIIB and New Development Bank (aka BRICS bank) $2 billion each, according to the Financial Times.The Myanmar Times asked Mr Woetzel whether the major funding source will be multilateral institutions, bilateral ones or the private sector. He said all of the organisations would be a part of it but the private sector will take the lion’s share.“I don’t think there will be one source of funding available that will cover all the infrastructure or economic development needs of the country. Historically, financing has come from the government’s own revenues – the borrowing capacity. Additionally, multilateral funding, whether it’s from the AIIB or other sources, will be a part of it.“But, by far, the biggest investment opportunity is from the private sector again, whether it’s through PPPs [public-private partnerships], institutional investors, IPOs [initial public offerings] or even equity funding – creating an environment which is business and investor-friendly is a big part of capturing the very large amount of additional capital that’s available for investments, inside and outside of China.“There’s clearly more money out there looking for investment projects than projects that are fundable,” he said.BRI implementation obstacles in MyanmarThere are two main challenges of implementing the BRI in Myanmar, according to Mr Woetzel. The first one is creating an investor-friendly environment with transparency, the rule of law, stable operating conditions and more.The second challenge is about human capital.“If we look at where investments which are made by China, Africa, for example, shows that 80 percent of the employees of Chinese companies in Africa are local. But only 50pc of the managers are local. Clearly, the capacity to develop local managers, and to employ local people, is scaled to the local population.“That’s going to be the biggest, or second biggest, challenge to sustainable investment flows.“Engaging the business community, both inside and outside of Myanmar, will be critical to work together with the business community to increase the skills of the local population,” he explained.What about sending huge numbers of the Chinese workforce to set up and operate projects? He did not think that would be sustainable or feasible financially.“Unfortunately, I don’t think that it’s a sustainable model. For some things which require large, upfront deployments, such as building a complex steel plant or a one-off capital investment, you could probably send over a workforce to do that, but they would come home again, back to China. Again, with our African research, 80pc of employees are local,” he said.More significantly, the McKinsey senior partner told The Myanmar Times that the human capital issue poses a bigger challenge than the financial issue and would determine how the country fares compared to the rest of ASEAN.“Myanmar, given its size, population and proximity, would be very well-positioned to benefit from those investment flows. Whether it in fact it does, depends on the investor-friendly environment and the availability of human capital for support.“I don’t think financial capital is the big issue here – there’s more than enough money around – but how to put to good use in getting good projects, earn a return, and can be sustainably managed by a local workforce determines how much of that capital actually comes to Myanmar,” he said.Mr Woetzel also said that the BRI is a multi-decade event and it would take time before the scheme bears fruit in a visible way. Export performance, infrastructure development and household income are important yardsticks by which success could be measured.“In the short-term, we can start looking at economic activity as indicators – there’s no better indicator than export performance. You can look around the world for BRI countries and see some that are making a lot progress fairly quickly and others which are not so much.“In addition to the infrastructure investments, we should be able to measure the development of electricity, electrification, road access, the time to market, logistics cost etc.“Those are the two things that I would look at: export performance and physical progress in infrastructure, and finally also employment,” he said, adding that ultimately people should look at how the local people are benefited from the scheme by indicators such as changes in wages and household income.Mr Woetzel wrapped up the interview by offering an advice to how the Myanmar government and businesses can capture the opportunity. He again emphasised the importance of having an investor-friendly environment. All in all, the key to securing success in the BRI for Myanmar is not so different from the solutions needed to woo international investors.“To that point, I think that the government needs to take a clear stance – it’s not enough to say it’s not against business, but to say ‘I am for business’. I think that is required, given the lack of a market and investor-friendly environment.“There has to be a clear statement of change: ‘Myanmar is open for business’,” he stressed.The government supporting and actively engaging the investment sector would send a signal to private sector companies to do likewise – that they should be aggressive in reaching out and finding ways to bring in technology, “to modernise their operations to build new distribution channels using the internet, using better factories and better trucks.”“It is a great opportunity for the people of Myanmar to realise their potential by a new and a more market-driven approach. Other approaches have been tried, but now it is the chance to take a new approach for the Myanmar based on an investor-friendly environment,” he concluded.","/business/26259-investor-friendly-environment-and-human-capital-essential-for-myanmar-s-success-in-the-belt-and-road-initiative.html"
"107",107,"Global players seek role in peace process",2017-06-05,"Opinion","As shown at the second session of the 21st-Century Panglong Peace Conference last month, China has emerged as the most important foreign player in Myanmar’s peace process.          Other countries that were associated with the peace efforts long before they took on their current form and substance are also fine-tuning their roles to ensure an inclusive peace process.The indigenous effort is aimed at ending a half century of war between the central government in Nay Pyi Taw and ethnic armed groups. Unlike other peace processes in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, a third-party mediator or facilitator is often called upon to assist the conflicting groups. However, the current peace effort is facing a new challenge with more assertive outside players, whose core interests will be affected if they remain beningn.The second Panglong ended inconclusively over longstanding key issues related to secession and federalism. The dialogue will continue and intensify in coming months to bring in the remaining armed ethnic groups as signatories of the nationwide ceasefire agreement and the movement forward for political dialogue. Uncertainties are aplenty, as the Northern Alliance members are still contemplating their role in the peace process despite Beijing’s growing pressure.Zhao Guo An, head of the Wa State External Relations Department, was succinct, pointing out that their participation in the second session was due to China’s persuasion. With China firmly embedded in Myanmar’s peace process, Myanmar and other concerned countries must step up their efforts to engage all stakeholders in this long-running internal war.Now, China has really gone beyond the so-called “no-involvement policy” in Myanmar’s internal affairs and calls for a peaceful solution. Myanmar’s tacit support of the move is pivotal and due to the strong linkage between the two countries’ core interests. With Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s repeated visits to China and a surprise stopover in Yunnan, Myanmar-China ties have never been closer.As President Xi Jinping has given top priority to his grand strategy, known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China is ready to get involved head-on to ensure that its wider regional international core interests will not be derailed. To accomplish this mammoth scheme, China requires a peaceful and stable regional environment, especially the one closer to home. Unmistakably, the Kyaukphyu-Kunming Oil and Gas Pipeline is the most important energy lifeline in operation now and is strategic to the development of China’s southwestern region. Lest we forget, breaking the isolation of this impoverished region was China’s primary justification for the BRI launching in 2013.This helps explain why last month in a surprise announcement Beijing said it would offer to mediate a diplomatic row over the flight of displaced persons from Rakhine State. Beijing understands well the spill over effects and disruption that any community conflicts and violence could have on this energy lifeline, which cuts across sensitive areas in Myanmar.Before China normalised ties with Southeast Asian countries in the mid-1990’s, Beijing made a dramatic decision to halt all assistance to communist insurgents operating in the region. For instance, before Thailand’s decision to establish diplomatic ties with China, former foreign minister ACM Siddhi Savestila received a personal guarantee from Chinese leaders that clandestine radio stations based in Yunnan and operated by the former Communist Party of Thailand would be shut down.Now China does not have such a dilemma as it did in the 1990’s. However, judging from China’s diplomatic behaviour, it can safely be concluded that when push comes to shove, Beijing would consider the overall strategic value of its core interests, which must be protected at all costs. Sooner rather than later, such a manifestation will be apparent in China’s engagement in the Myanmar peace process and its handling of armed groups along the Myanmar-China border.Apart from China, the EU, US and India have all along provided assistance to facilitate political dialogue and confidence-building between the government and the armed groups. In the previous government, their financial assistance laid the groundwork for trust-building, a prerequisite for nation-building and the reconciliation process.Japan’s role in the peace process is notable due to its humanitarian nature. Tokyo even appointed a special envoy – Yohei Sasagawa, chair of the Nippon Foundation – to engage exclusively in the peace and national reconciliation process. Tokyo has been generous in providing funding to numerous ethnic communities in conflict areas. Japan drew valuable lessons from the divided Southeast Asia of the 1970’s in creating a conducive environment, particularly in economic development and strengtening social well-being to enable conflicting parties to live and work together after they achieve peace.In case of Myanmar’s eastern flank, Thailand also has been providing logistical support for the armed groups to meet and hold discussions in Chiang Mai and other places. So far, Bangkok has been discreet out of fear that it would jeopardise the delicate peace process. With a peaceful 2401-kilometre border, the two countries are planning together how they can turn their common border area into economic zones to attract local and foreign investment. They have worked on a common strategy to resettle Myanmar’s remaining displaced people in Thailand – one of outstanding issues discussed in the second session.It remains to be seen what role outside players, both visible and invisible, would play in the future peace process. One trend is clear: Myanmar must engage all outside players in balanced ways taking into consideration their transitional and aspirational roles. Failure to do so would jeopardise Myanmar’s own peacemaking and nation-building efforts.","/opinion/26258-global-players-seek-role-in-peace-process.html"
"108",108,"Gas-fired plant in Mandalay to operate with BOT agreement",2017-06-02,"Business","The biggest gas-fired power plant, with a capacity of 225 megawatts, will start operations in December this year in the Taungtha and Myingyan district in Mandalay Region, a senior official from the Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MOEE), told The Myanmar Times.           The project, which is estimated to involve US$300 million (K410.18 billion) investment, is led by the Singapore-based Sembcorp, according to U Khin Maung Win, managing director of Myanmar Electric Power Generation Enterprise (EPGE) under the Ministry of Electricity and Energy..The completion of the power plant project was initially planned for May 2017, but has been re-scheduled to December, he said.The project will receive assistance from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), according to U Khin Maung Win.The power plant is an independent power producer (IPP). An IPP is an entity, which is not a public utility, but which owns facilities to produce electric power for sale to utilities and end users.The project is also secured with a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract. A BOT contract is a type of arrangement in which the private sector builds and establishes an infrastructure project, operates it and eventually transfers ownership of the project to the government.According to the agreement between the ministry and Sembcorp, the MOEE will have to buy at least 85 percent of the electricity generated by the plant in a year. However, the amount of electricity to be bought may vary depending on the demand, U Khin Maung Win said.The contract also stipulated that the MOEE will have to send 37.5 million cubic feet of natural gas daily to the plant and the price for its output is roughly $0.032 per unit if the ministry buys up to 82pc and $0.03 per unit if it buys 100pc.“Sembcorp’s investment is estimated to be about $300 million. We don’t have that much money.“They will leave after regaining their investment. They will continue to carry out and initiate other projects.“After the company has made a return from its initial investment, the state will take over the ownership of the power plant for free. But as the purchase price per unit is high, we suffer losses,” he said.The land where the plant is located is owned by the MOEE. Ground work for the project began in April 2016, with construction commencing in November in the same year.At the moment, there are two other gas-fired power plants running in Taungtha: a 90-MW plant operated by Glasgow-headquartered Aggreko and a 133-MW one by Hong Kong-based VPower Group.Also, there is a 90-MW gas-fired power plant in Kyaukphyu, Rakhine State and an 80-MW plant in Kyaukse, Mandalay Region.The gas needed for those power plants has been supplied through the domestic share of Myanmar in the Myanmar-China gas pipeline. Shareholders in that pipeline are Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, Chinese state-owned oil and gas corporation China National Petroleum Corporation, South Korea’s Daewoo, India’s and others.Translation by Zaw Nyunt","/business/26246-gas-fired-plant-in-mandalay-to-operate-with-bot-agreement.html"
"109",109,"Chinese SOE-led infrastructure development will enhance trade",2017-05-23,"Business","The Myanmar Times sat down with Bernard Charnwut Chan, president of Asia Financial Holdings and grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, the late founder of Bangkok Bank, to talk about the BRI, its relevance to Myanmar and the region and how Hong Kong can facilitate Sino-ASEAN trade and investments.                          “The glory of the ancient Silk Road shows that geographical dispersion is not insurmountable,” Chinese President Xi Jinping told the 29 heads of state, among them, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who travelled to Beijing for the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation on May 14 and 15.           The Belt and Road InitiativeLaunched in 2013 as “One Belt, One Road”, the scheme involves China underwriting billion-dollar investments, mainly in infrastructure, in countries along the old Silk Road and new routes -- linking Asia, Europe and more remote areas in Africa. The financial commitment illustrates the ambition: China is spending roughly US$150 billion a year in the 68 countries which have signed on to the project. The China Development Bank alone has earmarked $890 billion for some 900 projects.The summit meeting has attracted the largest number of foreign dignitaries to the Chinese capital since the 2008 Olympic Games, and is President Xi’s second international event this year, following his speech against protectionism at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January.Amid all the excitement and fanfare for China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), The Myanmar Times sat down with Bernard Charnwut Chan, president of Asia Financial Holdings and grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, the late founder of Bangkok Bank, to talk about the BRI, its relevance to Myanmar and the region and how Hong Kong can facilitate Sino-ASEAN trade and investments.Mr Chan is a member of the executive council, the top-level cabinet of the Hong Kong government, as well as a deputy to the Chinese National People’s Congress. He is also chair of Hong Kong-Thailand Business Council and co-president of the Maritime Silk Road Society.Infrastructure leads to trade and tourismThe Economist Intelligence Unit has described the BRI project as “long on rhetoric and short on implementation, with related economic activity showing little sign of a step change”. In spite of the three years since its launch, Myanmar’s private sector has not witnessed significant changes yet. The China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), for example, has only approved one project in Myanmar so far – the $20 million loan to develop a gas power plant project in Myingyan, Mandalay Region. For Mr Chan, the last three years have been a formation period for China’s state-owned enterprises to prepare for the implementation.“Clearly, this BRI is a state policy. The fact that it is a state policy has huge implications – not just politically but also economically because many of the Chinese SOEs are very much influenced by state policies,” he said.After the launch, many SOEs have spent the past three years exploring and investigating how to take advantage of the policy. Because it is a state policy, the Chinese government is offering vast amounts of resources and support for SOEs to develop along the BRI direction.“For those SOEs that I’m involved in, they all have to look at those BRI opportunities.”The reach of the BRI is very extensive – more than 60 countries spanning three continents. According to Mr Chan, ASEAN and Myanmar’s geographical proximity to China will create immediate synergy and allow infrastructure projects to take off in the region.“ASEAN are practically our next-door neighbours. So I suspect ASEAN, for sure, will be a very obvious choice for SOEs to look at. The first wave of these so-called initiatives will be about infrastructure, followed by trade and then other development such as tourism. Infrastructure is the most imminent.“When SOEs open a map and wonder ‘Well, where do we start? Where do we go?’ I would assume that Myanmar would be a very logical place where these corporations would definitely want to build the connection between China and the area in terms of infrastructure.“In the last three years, much of BRI has been dealt at the planning stage but now you will start to see more and more Chinese companies locating opportunities in where they can actually find synergy,” he said.Research conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit suggests that over 60 percent of Chinese overseas direct investment flows to BRI countries in 2013-15 were directed to ASEAN countries.Different countries have their own advantages, or unique selling points (USPs). For countries with rich natural resources, Chinese energy SOEs would be attracted to venture into the market.The “overarching strategy” of the BRI, for Mr Chan, is a win-win.“You can arguably say that it’s a win-win; win for China and win for their counterparts. I’m sure Myanmar and other ASEAN countries would want to be in a partnership with China as well,” he said, adding that, at this level, projects would mainly be infrastructure. Trade and services such as finance, engineering, architecture and insurance will follow.“This is definitely not a one-year or two-year project, this will likely take a good 15-20 years,” he added.Gateway between ASEAN and greater ChinaThe executive councillor also reiterated his support for Hong Kong to join the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), citing the reason that it would enhance the city’s competitive advantage and avoid relying exclusively on the mainland. Tax structure and other factors favour Hong Kong firms to expand into the Southeast Asian region.“I increasingly find that many Chinese companies will prefer to use their subsidiaries in Hong Kong as a gateway to go abroad. For example, Bank of China has decided to use Bank of China Hong Kong as their flagship to go in.“Those subsidiaries in Hong Kong have far more flexibility to deal with an urgent expansion. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as tax or corporate factors. Being in China, sometimes you have the different reporting regime; but with Hong Kong, we play by international rules. It’s much easier.“Again, when you deal with partnership, you surely need to figure out which law it is based on – Hong Kong law, Myanmar law or mainland Chinese law. Hong Kong tends to be a place where people generally would favour because it is neutral. The legal system and arbitration here give the assurance to both sides,” he explained.The city’s participation in the Beijing summit has illustrated its eagerness to take part in the BRI. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying led a 30-strong delegation and also delivered a speech about financial connectivity during a panel discussion. In contrast, China’s decision not to invite Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reflects the tension between the two countries following a few diplomatic fallouts last year.“Even though, in theory, the BRI is between China and the rest, in practice Hong Kong will be playing a role,” the Chinese congress deputy emphasised once again.Tackling the “China factor”Then, there is the “China factor”. For years, the country was Myanmar’s only ally and chief investor, and the then-military regime opened up partly because they did not like China’s monopoly status. Many commentators have argued that China’s role will be crucial for Myanmar’s peace process. But this factor is not only political; it also has enormous economic implications. Ultimately, China would be a vitally important, if not dominant, partner for Myanmar in terms of regional trade and foreign direct investments (FDIs).The glaring economic asymmetry is conspicuous enough by looking at Yunnan, one of China’s poorer provinces. Its economy is four times bigger than that of Myanmar, its more populous neighbour.“For any country, you do not want to rely only on one or two trading partners. You would definitely want to expand that reach beyond to hedge your bets. I can see every reason why Myanmar would not want to count on one partner.“But the fact is that China is China, and it is a huge market. So, whether you like it or not, China will continue to be a major trading partner for the entire region.“If I were to be the Myanmar government, I would try as much as I could to expand that scope of regional partners, otherwise you’re stuck – you never know if something happens to the Chinese economy. However, to replace China is impossible; China will continue to be a major trading partner for every country in the region because it is a huge market,” Mr Chan said.And it is not just limited to the market size. Chinese financing is also pivotal for Myanmar’s infrastructure thirst. The region has long suffered from a chronic deficit of infrastructure.Despite China’s importance, Bernard Chan is confident that the US dollar will remain the leading currency for trade in ASEAN and Myanmar.“The renminbi will continue to play a significant role, but it will never replace the US dollar. The US dollar is still a major trading currency.“The most you can do is for Myanmar to use a basket of currency, including the renminbi. But you certainly would not use that to replace the US dollar; it’s just impossible – I don’t think it is technically feasible,” he added.","/business/26108-chinese-soe-led-infrastructure-development-to-be-followed-by-trade.html"
"110",110,"The Belt and Road Initiative: China’s vision for globalisation, Beijing-style ",2017-05-19,"Opinion","China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a multifaceted economic, diplomatic and geopolitical undertaking that has morphed through various iterations, from the “New Silk Road” to “One Belt One Road”.           The BRI imagines a US$1.3 trillion Chinese-led investment program creating a web of infrastructure, including roads, railways, telecommunications, energy pipelines, and ports. This would serve to enhance economic interconnectivity and facilitate development across Eurasia, East Africa and more than 60 partner countries.First proposed in September 2013, it is the signature foreign policy initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping. It is a project of unprecedented geographical and financial scope.BRI has two primary components: the overland Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB), and the sea-based 21st-century Maritime Silk Road (MSR). Together, they form the “belt” and “road”.SREB’s overland infrastructure network encompasses the New Eurasia Land Bridge and five economic corridors: China-Mongolia-Russia; China-Central Asia-West Asia; China-Pakistan; the China-Indochina peninsula; and Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar. The SREB’s connective sinews will be high-speed rail and hydrocarbon pipeline networks.The MSR is focused on developing key seaports that connect to land-based transportation routes.China has been at pains to emphasise the co-operative nature of the initiative and its objective of “win-win outcomes”. In his address to the Belt and Road Forum for International Co-operation in Beijing, Xi framed the BRI in terms of “peace and co-operation”, “openness and inclusiveness”, “mutual learning”, and “mutual benefit”.Yet behind the rhetoric of harmony and mutuality lies a substantive strategy for growing an emerging China-led operating system for the international economy. This could potentially succeed the US-led Washington Consensus and Bretton Woods system.What China gets from the BRIBRI projects are likely to increase China’s economic and political leverage as a creditor.China has established the multilateral Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the $40 billion Silk Road Fund. These are financial vehicles for BRI infrastructure projects, yet the vast bulk of funding to date has come from China’s big state-owned investment banks.The prospect of access to Chinese financial largesse to fund much-needed infrastructure investments has attracted attention from many prospective partner nations. Many of these appreciate the minimal political conditionalities that come with Chinese finance, in comparison to finance on offer from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.The BRI has been viewed as a way for China to productively use its enormous, $3 trillion capital reserves, internationalise the renminbi, and deal with structural issues as its economy navigates the so-called “new normal” of lower growth.Perhaps foremost among these is the issue of industrial over-capacity. Having maxed out investment-driven growth through a frenzy of domestic infrastructure building following the 2008 global financial crisis, the BRI represents an international stimulus package that will utilise China’s idle industrial capacity and safeguard jobs in key industries such as steel and cement.This is a significant political dividend for the Chinese government. The Chinese Communist Party’s legitimacy rests on maintaining economic growth and improving people’s standard of living.In relation to energy security, the BRI will assist China in diversifying its energy sources through greater access to Russian and Iranian oil and gas. This will be achieved by linking with pipeline networks from Russia and Central Asia.By investing in pipelines from Gwadar, on the coast of Pakistan, to Xinjiang, and from coastal Myanmar to Yunnan, China also can diversify its transportation routes for maritime energy supplies. This reduces its vulnerability to energy supply disruption at maritime choke-points in the Strait of Malacca and the South China Sea.The establishment of port facilities in the Indian Ocean will also be advantageous to the emerging blue-water capability of the People’s Liberation Army Navy. This would assist in keeping vulnerable critical sea lines of communication open for maritime energy supplies from the Middle East.Collectively, these measures could reduce the ability of the US Navy to blockade China’s energy supply routes in any future conflict scenario.Geopolitical implications of the BRIAfter more than a decade of conjecture about China’s increasing international assertiveness, the Chinese government has now clearly signalled its intention to assume a more prominent global leadership role through the BRI.China is aiming to spur a new round of economic globalisation, but in a changed international order that it has a pivotal role in shaping.The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the BRICS New Development Bank, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership are the “software of integration” – the financial pillars of trade and investment in this vision.The BRI is the development vehicle – the “hardware of trade and investment” and the final pillar on which China’s claim to global leadership rests.Somewhat paradoxically, given the investment focus on hydrocarbon pipelines, the BRI also represents the vehicle through which China is likely to shape the contours of the emerging international post-carbon economy. The Paris Agreement in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is a keystone document in this respect.A combination of the climate emergency and market behaviours are making fossil fuel energy production increasingly uneconomic. This has spurred an accelerating transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy generation.China is a world leader in green and alternative energy technologies. Through the BRI it is well-placed to be the dominant player in facilitating the transition and roll-out of renewable energy infrastructure across Eurasia. This is especially so since the Trump administration has ceded American influence in international climate politics through its repudiation of proactive climate policies.Leadership on international climate action is one area in which China can develop significant soft power cache, particularly with developing countries of the global south.China’s BRI announcement is also reflective of the relative decline of the US as the world’s pre-eminent power. A declaration of intent as bold as that made in Beijing over the weekend at the Belt and Road Forum for International Co-operation would have been inconceivable prior to the 2016 US election.The Trump administration’s clumsy foreign policy manoeuvrings have damaged US prestige, weakened the integrity of a liberal international order already under duress, and opened a window for China to stake its claim.The BRI also signals a deepening of the Sino-Russian strategic partnership. This is based on a complementary supplier-consumer energy relationship and a mutual antagonism to the US.However, not all regional countries see the BRI as a boon. The Indian government has expressed reservations over the BRI’s China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and China’s Indian Ocean ambitions.The BRI now ups the ante for regional middle powers like Australia that have deftly attempted to hedge between the US and China. Australia’s foreign policymakers must weigh up the case for engaging with the BRI and having a seat at the table as China’s vision takes shape. Benjamin Habib is a lecturer, School of Social Sciences, La Trobe University and Viktor Faulknor is a PhD Candidate in International Relations, La Trobe University.","/opinion/26067-the-belt-and-road-initiative-china-s-vision-for-globalisation-beijing-style.html"

While attending the meeting of the Belt and Road Forum (BRF) for International Cooperation hosted by China, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi discussed with the UN Secretary-General issues related to Myanmar’s internal national reconciliation and peace process, including the government’s preparatory efforts for holding the second round of 21CPC.Twenty-nine heads of states and representatives from 130 countries attended the forum that started on Sunday, May 14.The forum marks the grand opening of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that comprises “the Silk Road Economic Belt” and “the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road”.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi participated in several sessions on “Policy Synergy for Closer Partnership”, “Closer People-to-People Bond” and “Connective Cooperation for Interconnected Development”, according to a Myanmar foreign ministry press release.The State Counsellor and Foreign Minister, who also holds the President’s Office Minister portfolio, had sideline meetings with heads of state from Switzerland, Sri Lanka, Poland and Mongolia, the statement added.The BRI is a development strategy envisioned by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013.The focus is promotion of connectivity and cooperation among the countries involved in the project.After founding the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank with a capital investment of US$100 billion, China allocated $40 billion to the Silk Road Fund.Chinese financial institutions – such as the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China – will lend money to countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative for the development of infrastructure.During the forum, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for cooperation among BRI members and for the rejection of protectionism.He has reportedly also said that China will seek a common prosperity with its ‘Belt and Road Initiative’, and not political dominance.The international meeting ended yesterday and the next BRI forum will be held in 2019.Heads of states and representatives of organisations from 68 countries have signed the Belt and Road Cooperation Agreement with China yesterday.On cooperation with China, Myanmar is part of the BCIM forum that intends to foster greater integration in trade and investment among four nations – Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar – which was agreed to in 2013.The corridor is an expressway that would link China’s Kunming to Kolkata of India via Mandalay of Myanmar, Daka and Chittagong of Bangladesh.An editorial run by The Irrawaddy on May 12 told the nation’s leaders to be well aware of how to make a good deal with China, which has major business and strategic interests in Myanmar.“Kyaukphyu is key to the BRI as it sits on the Bay of Bengal and will provide strategic geo-economic access to the Indian Ocean, where China wants to develop maritime infrastructure,” said the editorial.“Burma won’t reject the BRI; the interesting element is how the country’s leadership deals with the initiative. It is time to negotiate from a position of strength,” said the editorial.","/national-news/25983-state-counsellor-invites-un-secretary-general-to-attend-21cpc.html"
"112",112,"Foreign NGOs accused of instigating opposition against Myitsone dam",2017-05-03,"Business","“If you want to get rich, you have to build roads first,” Chinese leader Xi Jinping told delegates after the signing ceremony of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in 2014, citing a Chinese saying.           The One Belt One Road initiative (OBOR) – Beijing’s grand design to connect China and Eurasia with roads and railways and other transport infrastructures – passes through Myanmar and the Indian subcontinent, linking the country up with South Asia, Kunming and the rest of the ASEAN. Myanmar’s participation is crucial in Beijing’s ambitious plan.During the time of Western sanctions, China had long been the patron of the then-military regime, offering investment and support for the isolated country. The Chinese diasporas in Myanmar are also actively engaged in businesses and often act as a bridge for Chinese firms to enter the market. But the warm relationship has strained recently as tensions emerged between Beijing and Nay Pyi Taw on several controversial infrastructure projects, and as Myanmar opens up to the rest of the world and seeks a more balanced diplomatic strategy. Despite the changes, China is an increasingly important partner for the NLD-led government, who needs Chinese support to stabilise their common border and military conflicts with armed ethnic groups.In an exclusive interview with The Myanmar Times, Wong Kyin Pyu sat down at Kowloon Shangri-La in Hong Kong to share his thoughts on the Belt and Road, Sino-Myanmar economic relations and Chinese investments in the country. Mr Wong is the executive vice president of Hong Kong-based Maritime Silk Road Society, and chair of the Hong Kong Myanmar Overseas Chinese Association.Foreign NGOs instigated public opposition against Myitsone damBack in 2015, Mr Wong said that several Sino-Myanmar projects were “called off or dishonoured” by the government under U Thein Sein without the consent of contract partners or Chinese state-owned enterprises. Mr Wong accused foreign NGOs of supporting and sponsoring anti-government parades regarding those controversial projects, namely the Myitsone dam and the Rakhine-Kunming railway project.At Shangri-La, he repeated his view that “US, Japan and Singapore NGOs” were responsible for “instigating public opposition against the Myitsone dam” without naming any organisations.“By shelving the [Myitsone dam] project, U Thein Sein in a way showed to the West and its allies that Myanmar could say ‘No’ to their giant neighbour, China, which resulted in the subsequent visits from Hillary Clinton and President Obama, and the lifting of all sanctions against Myanmar,” he said, noting that no sitting American president had ever visited Myanmar in the past since its 1948 independence. In 2016, then-President Obama lifted most, but not all, of the US economic sanctions imposed on Myanmar, marking the culmination of years of rapprochement that the Obama administration fostered. Most notably, though, section 312 of the Patriot Act has remained in force.“However, U Thein Sein had eventually paid a dear price for this. The lack of trust between the two neighbouring countries emerged. The powerful then-vice president Thiha Thura Tin Aung Myint Oo, who helped sign the Myitsone deal, resigned. Consequently, investments from China dropped heavily, despite U Thein Sein’s compensation efforts towards China.“Those efforts include building a replica of Shwedagon Pagoda with jewels and precious stones at the crown of the Pagoda in Bai Ma Shi, Luo Yang, China, entirely at Myanmar’s own cost, declaring Myanmar as one of the first supporters for China’s OBOR and taking an active part in the celebration of the 70th anniversary of Victory of War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression in Beijing,” he said.The government and other sources told Reuters in early April that China had stopped pushing hard for the 6000-megawatt project to go ahead, and instead, “wants a face-saving solution” that would allow it to advance its other interests if the dam is cancelled. Mr Wong echoed this view.“China should no longer pursue the project as we had better not open old wounds. We could negotiate with the current Myanmar government and replace the Myitsone project with other more viable, as well as more profitable, smaller dam projects.”Belt and Road’s viability for the private sectorChina’s leader Xi Jinping initiated China’s framework for the One Belt One Road initiative (OBOR) in 2013. Three years have passed since, yet many in the business community are still cautious about the risks and motives.Developments are also slow in coming – the AIIB has only funded one project in Myanmar so far. But Mr Wong is optimistic that more substance will be realised this year. He sees OBOR as “the biggest business opportunity given to Myanmar over the century” and will boost the country’s “infrastructure development, technology advancement and cross-border trading”. Myanmar’s strategic importance to China is due to its stake at the Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM), which will open up the western part of China.He is hopeful that concrete developments will take place this year, such as the Kyaukpyu SEZ deep-water port project, “which is now mainly backed up by CITIC, one of the biggest state-owned groups in China”.“There are also ongoing Sino-Myanmar development projects in Kyaukpyu including the Kyaukpyu-Kunming railway, oil pipeline and natural gas pipeline terminal, which are also crucial in the big picture of the OBOR,” he explained.Tom Miller, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, a research company, says that Chinese officials privately expect to lose 80 percent of their investments in Pakistan, 50pc in Myanmar, and 30pc in Central Asia. It is hard to imagine investments on projects with such a low return percentage were driven by commercial logic. According to Mr Wong, the infrastructure and technology sectors need initial financial support from financially powerful investing countries, but the business opportunities for the private sector lie elsewhere.“These [infrastructure and technology] investments mainly serve for the greater good of the developing countries under the OBOR framework. Personally, I don’t think these estimates should be a direct concern for private sector as they are mainly referring to national level infrastructural projects, which usually serve a political purpose.“There are still a lot of business opportunities commercially viable for private sector investment such as real estate development, banking services, cross border trading, e-commerce and so on. Private Sectors should see this as a valuable opportunity to expand its business network from its local reach to greater Asia,” he said, adding that the private sector should only take part in commercially viable projects after due diligence and deliberations.The private sector should “work hand-in-hand with the local overseas Chinese entrepreneurs”, which would solve the issue of red tape and local bureaucratic complications.“The private sector is interested in taking part in OBOR as they can find some ways to get financing from the AIIB and enjoy the preferential treatment policies in the Sino-ASEAN free trade zones,” he said.The Chinese government made political decisions on its state-financing projects abroad, such as the railroad financing in Tanzania and huge investments in Pakistan and Malaysia. Those projects helped China cement its ties with the Muslim world.“One could notice that Islamic fundamentalists or radical Muslims seldom attack or give troubles to China. Even the Muslim-majority Xinjiang province is relatively peaceful most of the time.“The same applies to Myanmar and Central Asia while the Chinese government is in fact losing a very high percentage of its investments over there,” he concluded.In fact, there might be other strategic factors in play apart from appeasing the Muslim community. According to the Financial Times, China’s $46-billion plan to finance an economic corridor through Pakistan, connecting the port of Gwadar to north-west China, is motivated partly by the demand for an alternative route for oil and gas imports from the Middle East to avoid rising tensions in the South China Sea. The BCIM corridor together with the oil pipelines could be understood in a similar context as well.Looking ahead in Sino-Myanmar economic relationsA common complaint from the private sector is that the NLD-led government’s economic policies are too little, too late and too vague. For Mr Wong, however, the new administration presents an opportunity for Myanmar and China to wipe the plate clean and start everything afresh.“The ex-military government was quite deeply involved in the economy, which in turn created barriers to foreign investments, which included land-grabs, poorly enforced employment standards, rampant child labour and an economy dominated by cronies of the former military regime and companies under the control of the Ministry of Defence.“The new NLD-led government has not made much progress in terms of economic policies since they took over the office. Myanmar Foreign Investment Law has not been changed … and new policies that were officially introduced last year seemed only to be general directives rather than pragmatic measures,” he said. Given these reasons, local businesses generally find it easier to work with the previous government as everyone was familiar with the bureaucratic practices then.The NLD-led government supports a more transparent economic framework, economic reforms and liberalisation. These are conducive to attracting more Chinese investments as more information is available to investors and the country has retained its close ties with China.There are many major challenges for Sino-Myanmar economic relations, according to Mr Wong, including the country’s slow progress of the national peace process and “immature social consciousness”.“Interference from international NGOs and domestic civil society organisations, and its [Myanmar’s] close relationship with Japan and the influence of some Western countries remain the biggest challenges for maintaining a strong Sino-Myanmar economic relationship,” he said, adding that despite the challenges, there are regular high-level contacts between the two neighbours and both have promoted bilateral trade relations.“Myanmar has ports in the Bay of Bengal which – if they were to be made more accessible – could offer China substantially shorter shipping routes to the Middle East and the West.“But due to the fierce opposition and pressure from Singapore [Myanmar’s close ASEAN ally], Japan [a potential investor and donor] and the US, Myanmar shelved Myitsone dam and scrapped the high speed rail project from Kyaukphyu to Kunming,” he remarked. Those factors risk derailing Myanmar’s economic development.Given the extensive border trade and geographical proximity with Kunming, Myanmar could develop its shipping industry.“The Yunnan capital would be able to use Myanmar’s existing ports to transport goods to Africa and the Middle East.”“China is still the largest trading partner and biggest investor of Myanmar ... For instance, the completion of the Sino-Myanmar oil and gas pipelines fully reflects the reciprocal nature of the project for the two countries,” said Mr Wong, who sees Myanmar political changes and its improved ties with Western countries as a challenge to China. Despite those obstacles, Sino-Myanmar relations will not diminish owing to China’s economic strengths.“In the future, China and Myanmar’s cooperation will definitely continue to strengthen in the political, economic, and social fields,” he summed up his thoughts.","/business/25832-foreign-ngos-accused-of-instigating-opposition-against-myitsone-dam.html"
"113",113,"“Wait and see” for Myitsone Dam’s future",2017-04-24,"National News","Although Myanmar President U Htin Kyaw’s China visit early this month was a success, the fate of the US$3.6 billion Myitsone Dam is still in a “wait and see” mode.           When President U Htin Kyaw visited China for six days earlier this month, he discussed the fate of the multi-billion dollar dam project with his Chinese counterparts.The Global Times reported that an agreement was reached on the Myitsone hydropower project that would benefit both countries. China’s vice foreign minister Liu Zhenmin said as much.“The two countries have similar intentions, and a basic agreement has been reached. The project has been halted for about six years now. An agreement that will bring benefits to both sides must be made,” Liu was quoted as saying.However, Myanmar officials said everything was still in a “wait and see” mode at this moment, pending the completion of the final report from the commission tasked with reviewing and scrutinising the Ayeyarwady hydropower projects.In 2011, following widespread public objection, the then president U Thein Sein suspended the construction of the controversial dam, pending further assessments.However, under the current National League of Democracy-led government, efforts have been made to find a win-win solution.A commission studying the Ayeyarwady Myitsone hydropower project, which is known as the Myitsone Commission, was formed by the new government to assess the overall environmental impact on the site.Last November, the commission delivered its interim report and findings to President U Htin Kyaw.The report assessed various outcomes of the projects from the political, economical, cultural and environmental aspects.It recommended a stop to the Myitsone Project, said a member of the commission who asked not be named.The dam has also been unpopular because it will cause the displacement of local villagers in the project sites.Before President U Htin Kyaw’s trip to China, there were already rumours that the project had been cancelled. But the commission member said the project’s future was merely uncertain.He said the commission was planning to send another report and it was still conducting reviews.“We don’t exactly know whether the project is going to be abolished with mutual understandings or otherwise. It is a possibility.”State Counsellor and Foreign Minister Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has previously made known that she paid special attention to the commission’s report and recommendations.According to sources in the Kachin local groups, who met with her, there was a good chance she would take the commission’s advice.Daw Nan Pu, a spokesperson for the Kachin-based Htoi Gender and Development Foundation, said Kachin civil society members, who met the State Counsellor, had asked about the Myitsone Project’s future.She said Daw Aung San Suu Kyi replied that she would wait for the commission’s final report.“Before the new government was formed, they said the Myitsone Project should be stopped immediately. However, after the government was formed, no one has said anything about terminating Myitsone.“We, the Kachin people, want to know. When we asked Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, she was not very keen to reply. She simply said she was waiting for the commission’s report. It was not encouraging,” she opined.The future of Myitsone Project depends on the impending result by the union level investigation commission, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Permanent Secretary U Kyaw Zay Ya at an April 6 press conference held to discuss the government’s one-year performance.“Both sides need to wait patiently until the commission’s result is out for Myitsone,” he said.At the press conference, Ministry of Electrical Power and Energy’s Permanent Secretary U Htain Lwin said as the Myitsone Commission was a union level organisation, its recommendations would be implemented accordingly.“The commission will investigate and publish an accurate report. Our department will implement its report with follow-up procedures, depending on the investigations and analysis of the commission.“All will be made public,” he added.The Myanmar government and China-owned China Power Investment (CPI) Company signed a bilateral agreement for the $3.6 billion Myitsone Dam Project in 2006.Representatives of the two countries said Myanmar will receive 8 to 10 percent of the electricity produced by Myitsone Project free of charge, and will be able to purchase a further 20pc at market price based on the electricity requirement.However, foreign media Reuters and the New York Times have reported that it was likely China would give up the Myitsone Project.They reported that discussion was underway to determine whether China would be allowed to conduct other small hydroelectricity projects as compensation or pay a compensation fee to China.“Daw Aung San Suu Kyi can terminate Myitsone Project.“If the project is cancelled, there will be discussion about a big reimbursement in the realm of $800 million,” said Yun Sun, a senior associate and Asia expert at the Stimson Centre, a Washington-based think tank.Regardless of the outcome of the dam projects, the China-Myanmar bilateral ties would be maintained and both countries would implement long-term plans that benefit each other.This was consistent with a joint-announcement by both nations following President U Htin Kyaw’s visit.The Global Times reported that 28 world leaders including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi would attend the Belt and Road Summit in Beijing on May 14 and 15.Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed this mega project in 2013 to promote China’s trade and economic connectivity with Asia, Europe and Africa. – Translation by Kyaw Soe Htet and Swe Zin Moe","/national-news/25721-wait-and-see-for-myitsone-dam-s-future.html"
"114",114,"Myanmar displays diplomatic finesse on China, Russia and US",2017-04-24,"Opinion","Myanmar has made substantial shifts in its relations with major powers China, Russia and the United States. They are key regional players in Southeast Asia that will directly impact peace and stability as well as economic development in Myanmar.           In the first half of the year, China has made impressive diplomatic inroads throughout Southeast Asia, taking advantage of the lack of policy clarity coming from US President Donald Trump's administration. So far, Washington has flexed its muscles over the conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan and displayed a more reconciliatory tone on Europe. That much was clear. It was only on Thursday that Vice President Mike Pence disclosed that Trump would attend the Asia Pacific Economic Leaders Meeting in Vietnam, and the ASEAN-US Summit and East Asia Summit in the Philippines.Meanwhile, Beijing has been able to sharpen its long-standing policy and make the necessary adjustments to ensure strong friendships and cooperation with countries in the region. Myanmar President U Htin Kyaw’s recent visit to China demonstrated the new dynamics of their bilateral ties, which have encountered several challenges over the years.Obviously, China has placed the highest value on U Htin Kyaw’s week-long trip, knowing that, amid growing anxieties over US policy toward the region, this would be the most pivotal time to further strengthen their 67-year-old bilateral ties.The joint press communiqué issued after his visit was extensive and forward-looking, as China recognised the so-called Myanmar way of doing things.“China supported Myanmar in following a development path in line with its own national conditions and steadily promoted democratic transition ...” As such, it would commit Beijing to help Nay Pyi Taw in its endeavour to promote economic and political development at the same time. It must be noted here that such a commitment represents a new model of bilateral relations promoted by the current Chinese leadership.In addition, China expressed strong support for “Myanmar in realising domestic peace and national reconciliation through political dialogue.” In return, Myanmar thanked China for its assistance to Nay Pyi Taw’s efforts at domestic peace and national reconciliation and welcomed its continued constructive role in this process.Most importantly, as far as China-Myanmar relations are concerned, Myanmar reaffirmed its commitment to the One-China policy and continued support toward “China’s position on the questions of Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang.” Akin to Cambodia, Myanmar has become another ASEAN member that concurs with such stringent interpretations of the One-China policy.After the scandal over the seizure of Singaporean armoured vehicles in Hong Kong last November, China has attempted to prevent further erosion of the One-China policy by becoming more forceful in pressing ASEAN members to adhere to it.In 2014, Singapore concluded a free trade agreement with Taiwan by using different designations. The Philippines and Indonesia are pursuing a similar arrangement. Beijing is concerned that other ASEAN members will jump on the bandwagon, further complicating ties with the grouping. Goodwill GestureObviously, Myanmar agreed to such a comprehensive statement as a goodwill gesture following China’s support in March at the UN Security Council in blocking a proposed statement on the situation in Rakhine State. Russia, another member of the UN Security Council, also vetoed the statement. Previously, in January 2007, both countries blocked a UN resolution on the situation in Myanmar.The cosying up of the Myanmar-China friendship has been clearly manifested by the opening of their long-delayed oil pipeline, which will transport oil from the Bay of Bengal into China’s Yunnan province, some 800 kilometres inland. With both the oil and gas pipelines now in operation, Myanmar has suddenly become a major connectivity route for China’s Belt and Road Initiative – a showcase of Xi’s mega plan in mainland Southeast Asia. China’s efforts elsewhere, especially in Laos and Thailand, are still at the early stage.The quick start-up of the oil pipeline also indicates that future Myanmar-China relations will be further strengthened. Both countries are confident that any remaining challenges posed by the controversial Myitsone Dam and the Letpadaung mine in Sagaing Region will be resolved after final recommendations are made by the relevant assessment commissions.During U Htin Kyaw’s visit, he also received an assurance that China would continue to play a “constructive” role in the peace process. Myanmar’s National League of Democracy-led government has been pushing for the much-delayed second stage of the 21st-Century Panglong Conference, which is now scheduled to be held in May. State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi wants all armed ethnic groups to sign the nationwide ceasefire agreement. Those armed groups that were left out include the United Wa State Army, the Arakan Army, Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Ta’ang National Army and Kachin Independent Army.As the NLD-led government enters its second year, the peace process and border security remain top priorities but are equally elusive. The link between domestic and external factors was discussed during the summit meeting in Beijing, but whether it will produce positive results remains to be seen. To ensure that Myanmar and China are on the same page and follow similar strategic plans, Daw Suu Kyi has already confirmed her participation in the Belt and Road Initiative Summit in Beijing from May 14-15. Myanmar-Russia TiesIn comparison to China, Myanmar’s ties with Russia have been cordial, but they are still very much focused on military-related cooperation. The two countries will celebrate their 70th anniversary of relations next year. In retrospect, Russia has been faithful to Myanmar, treating the strategic Southeast Asian country as a gateway to ASEAN. Better Myanmar-ASEAN integration would also be beneficial to Russia.Due to Myanmar’s external factors and unique political system and non-aligned diplomacy, its bilateral ties with Russia have special characteristics, focusing heavily on military and security-related matters. The international boycott imposed by the West since the late 1980’s has further warmed their relationship. Russia had been quite sympathetic to Myanmar prior to its dramatic transformation in 2011. During the 1980s and ’90s, thousands of Myanmar officials and students went to Russia for training and study, especially in nuclear-related science and technology.At this juncture, Russia is diversifying its cooperation with Myanmar to include the economic, cultural and scientific fields. Although Russia does not have a big investment in Myanmar, its future interest in oil and gas exploration will increase its investment portfolio. Last year, Russia provided more than 300 scholarships to Myanmar students.Finally, after years of optimism over the prospects of US-Myanmar relations, the harsh realities have kicked in and seriously damaged the once unshakable bilateral relationship. Kudos must go to President Barack Obama, who worked closely with the previous administration under President U Thein Sein and invested lots of foreign policy effort to ensure that Myanmar moved toward a new era. Without him, the current transformation would not have been possible.Truth be told, the US interest in normalising ties with Myanmar was aimed essentially at distancing the country from North Korea to halt the former’s nuclear ambition and desired missile technological development. Washington was extremely concerned that there would be quick knowledge transfer of this know-how between the two countries. In late May 2011, the US Navy intercepted a North Korean ship in the Adaman Sea carrying missile technology destined for Myanmar and managed to force it to return home.Myanmar-North Korea ties were quickly neutralised and their nuclear cooperation subsequently stopped ahead of US-Myanmar normalisation. Given the current focus on the nuclear threat from North Korea dominating global headlines, Myanmar could have been targeted as well without the earlier policy U-turn.So far, the Trump administration has not yet made known its policy toward Myanmar, whether it would continue to pursue the same path or adopt a new one. However, judging from the US position and official comments on the Rakhine situation, Washington is pressuring Nay Pyi Taw to do more over the communal conflicts. Daw Suu Kyi has already asked the international community for time and patience as she deals with the issue through both domestic and international mechanisms.Early next month, she is scheduled to visit key members of the European Union following her participation in the 30th ASEAN Summit in Manila. She plans to update her colleagues on the latest developments in Rakhine and remedial measures that have been instituted there since they last met on December 19, 2016.It remains to be seen how her reputation and shuttle diplomacy will play out in coming months as Myanmar intensifies broader engagements with concerned major powers, while mitigating the adverse effects emanating from the Rakhine situation.","/opinion/25711-myanmar-displays-diplomatic-finesse-on-china-russia-and-us.html"
"115",115,"Myanmar and China sign crude oil pipeline agreement",2017-04-11,"National News","The signing of an agreement between Myanmar and China on crude oil pipeline transportation project was witnessed by leaders of the two countries on April 10, according to a press release by the Southeast Asia Crude Oil Pipeline (SEAOP), which is responsible for the operation of the pipeline.           The crude oil tanker named United Dynamic docked at Made Island in Rakhine State yesterday and started offloading crude oil, said the press release.“Myanmar-China natural gas and crude oil pipelines projects are joint operation between Myanmar and China and also a part of China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative,” it said.Myanmar President U Htin Kyaw met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing yesterday during his six-day visit to China.The crude oil pipeline project is one of the controversial Chinese projects in Myanmar. A 771 km-long crude oil pipeline from Made Island in western Myanmar to China’s northwest province Yunan is constructed across the central part of Myanmar. The pipeline is in parallel to a natural gas pipeline which was fully operational in 2014.China’s state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Myanmar government signed the agreement for the crude oil pipeline project in 2008 and construction of the project was completed in early 2015.Myanmar will directly obtain a road right fee of US$13.81 million from both gas and oil pipeline projects annually, plus a transit fee of $1 per ton of crude oil under a 30-year concession agreement.A trial operation of the crude oil pipeline was launched in January 2015 but full operations have been delayed as the two sides were unable to reach an agreement on commercial terms of the pipeline project, according to officials.The total investment of the entire crude oil pipeline project is $2.45 billion and CNPC holds 50.9 percent, with the rest belonging to Myanmar.The crude oil pipeline is designed to transmit 22 million tons of crude oil annually. The country’s first international oil unloading terminal in Made Island is a vast project site constructed with oil storage, dockyard, and seaport with a 38 km vessel route and 480 meter long oil loading terminal.The facility also has a total of 12 crude oil tanks each with a storage capacity of 22 million gallons.Meanwhile AFP reported that the two leaders also discussed the development of the controversial Myitsone dam, a $3.6 billion Beijing-backed project on hold since protests in 2011.  The two countries also signed nine cooperative agreements on areas spanning public health, sports and transportation.","/national-news/25676-myanmar-and-china-sign-crude-oil-pipeline-agreement.html"
"116",116,"Myanmar-China crude oil pipeline to commence next month",2017-04-03,"Business","After a two-year delay, the Myanmar-China crude oil pipeline is expected to begin operating in May, officials said this week.          The respective parties of Myanmar and China were discussing the terms and conditions on the crude oil pipeline operation since its soft opening launched in early 2015, according to officials.“The crude oil pipeline is getting ready for operation. We are awaiting instructions from the higher ups and we expect it will begin in May,” said an official from Southeast Asia Crude Oil Pipeline (SEAOP) which is responsible for the pipeline’s operation.The contract to transport crude oil was signed in Nay Pyi Taw on March 28 but the operation of utilising Made Island in Rakhine State is yet to be finalised, said an official from Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE). U Kyaw Nyan Tun, director (offshore) of MOGE told the Myanmar Times on March 29 that “the contract between China Oil and SEAOP was signed yesterday. MOGE witnessed the signing as the investment partner of the project. But they have to negotiate with Myanmar Port Authority for operation.”A larger amount of crude oil is going to be imported to Made Island in the coming week but they are unsure where to start in pumping crude oil to China through the pipeline, he added.SEAOP authorities invited some local and Yangon-based Chinese media last week to observe control and gas pumping stations near Mandalay. The firm also introduced some corporate social responsibility activities in the trip. The crude oil pipeline project is a controversial project in Myanmar, provoking serious opposition among the public and non-governmental organisations. In 2011, the new NLD-led government suspended Myitsone dam project in Kachin State because the Chinese-built hydropower project was accused of potentially damaging the environmental and community. A 771 km-long crude oil pipeline from Made Island in western Myanmar to China’s northwest province Yunan is to be constructed across the central part of Myanmar. The pipeline is parallel to the natural gas pipeline which was fully operational since 2014.  China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and the Myanmar government signed an agreement for a crude oil pipeline project in 2008, and construction was completed in early 2015.  Myanmar will directly obtain a road-right fee of US$13.81 million from both gas and oil pipeline projects annually and a transit fee of US$1 per tonne of crude oil under a 30-year concession agreement. A trial operation of the pipeline had been launched in January 2015 but full operation has been delayed as both sides were unable to reach an agreement on the commercial terms of the pipeline project, according to the official.The pipeline will provide a shortcut for crude oil from the Middle East to reach China, rather than being shipped southwards and passing through Singapore. Crude oil can be offloaded on Made Island in Rakhine State and transported via a 700-km pipeline across Myanmar to its terminus in China’s Yunnan province.The total investment of the pipeline project amounts to US$2.45 billion and CNPC controls 50.9 percent of the project while the rest of the shares belongs to Myanmar, according to officials. The crude oil pipeline is designed to transmit 22 million tonnes of crude oil annually. The country’s first international oil unloading terminal in Made Island is a vast project site featuring oil storage, a dockyard, and a seaport with a 38-km vessel route and a 480-metre loading terminal.

"117",117,"Joint-venture between British and Myanmar firms eyes oil and gas sector",2017-03-23,"Business","A British company has created a joint-venture with a Myanmar firm to enter the marine industry as well as oil and natural gas sector.           Representatives from the UK firm, James Fisher and Sons, and the Myanmar firm Royal Marine Technology Co Ltd, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at the Sule Shangri-La Hotel on March 20.Nick Henry, chief executive officer at James Fisher and Sons, said that the reason for entering into Myanmar is to assist with the country’s development of the crude oil and natural gas market, which has recently gained attention internationally.He added that the company will continue to provide services and support to oil and natural gas extraction companies, offer technological assistance, and educate local engineer graduates in the country.“The offshore services are going to expand in Myanmar quite soon. That’s why … we have signed a first-step agreement to collaborate with our domestic companies. The UK firm is working with our company to settle here,” said U Myint Aung, managing director of Royal Marine Technology.James Fisher and Sons will be providing resources such as container ships, and even submarines. It will also supply gas and oil pipeline-related construction equipment, along with repairs and maintenance machinery and apparatus.“There are marine-related services provided in the country, but a company offering large-scale services, such as this one, has [not yet arrived in Myanmar].“When the oil extraction companies need assistance, they have to look to expertise abroad,” U Myint Aung explained.If local oil and natural gas enterprises grow and develop, that will create a lot of employment opportunities. These foreign companies have a foresight, so they are coming here to settle their businesses, he added.The local Royal Marine Technology Co Ltd was founded two decades ago as a firm offering repairing services for ships. In recent years, the company has provided engineering services for offshore oil and natural gas stations and for the construction of a power plant.The oil and gas sector in Myanmar is a hotspot for exploration and has become an area of interest among international firms.According to research firm IHS Global Insights, Myanmar is estimate to possess 3.2 billion barrels of oil and 18 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas reserves. In fact, the country’s unproven and unrecorded resources may be vastly greater.A report on the oil and gas sector authored by the then-UK Trade and Investment Department (the predecessor organisation of the UK Department of Trade) states that Myanmar’s proven reserves are almost on a par with those in its neighbour, India, which possesses 5.7 billion barrels of oil and 18 trillion tcf of natural gas and is ranked 16th internationally in terms of the value of its resources by British Petroleum’s 2013 statistical review of world energy.In June 2014, the Myanmar government awarded 20 international firms preliminary rights to explore and produce offshore blocks.More recent onshore and offshore bidding rounds have brought some of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies to Myanmar. A number of companies which secured onshore and offshore exploration licenses in the 2013 offshore round were British companies including Shell, BG Group and Ophir Energy.According to the British Chamber of Commerce’s publication, Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Renewable Energy Market Snapshot published in September 2016, a total of US$4.8 billion in foreign investment was approved for the oil and gas sector in 2015-16, slightly more than 50% of total FDI for all sectors approved during the year.There are currently four offshore areas in operation.The oldest is Yadana, run by a consortium led by French firm Total. Yetagun is operated by Malaysia’s state giant Petronas, Shwe by the South Korean firm Daewoo International, and Zawtika by Thai company PTTEP. Shwe Gas links Myanmar and China via a cross-border pipeline to southern China.As of September 2016, many of the companies recently awarded offshore blocks were still conducting their initial stages of surveying and assessments. Many of the international corporations have partnered with local firms, particularly in shallow-water blocks, and domestic businesses in Myanmar are likely to benefit through improved skills and expertise.The British Chamber report states that onshore oil and gas projects have generally become smaller in scale in recent years than the offshore industry, though there are still plenty of opportunities for international investors.Initially the offshore gas industry was developed with an export focus. However, domestic electricity consumption is increasing rapidly. Hence, gas-fired generation is likely to be an essential part of Myanmar’s generation mix in the future.At present, the country’s local capacity is limited, which means there is a demand for international suppliers across the entire supply chain and in many different areas.According to the UKTI report, this is because of the lack of local capacity in terms of skilled personnel, and that the business community is keen to diversity their commercial partners. Sectors in demand include infrastructure and equipment, security, risk analysis, training and skills accreditation, legal and professional services, health and safety analysis, as well as environmental and social impact assessment consultancy services.Apart from British and western companies, Chinese corporations have also been expanding their reach in the sector.Yesterday, Reuters reported that a US$1.5 billion oil pipeline project to pump oil 770km (480 miles) across Myanmar to southwest China is set for imminent start-up, with a supertanker nearing the port of Kyaukphyu, marking the beginning of a new oil trading route. The deal was made despite simmering tensions between the Myanmar and Chinese governments.An agreement made between Myanmar’s government and China’s state-owned PetroChina will allow the Chinese energy corporation to import oil from overseas via the Bay of Bengal and pump it through the pipeline, which is expected to supply a new 260,000-barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery in China’s landlocked Yunnan province, according to Reuters. – Translation by Kyaw Soe Htet","/business/25436-joint-venture-between-british-and-myanmar-firms-eyes-oil-and-gas-sector.html"
"118",118,"Can China save the global order?",2017-03-22,"Opinion","At the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos in January, Chinese President Xi Jinping, drawing on China’s own recent experience, spoke in defence of globalization, and offered a vision of inclusive, sustainable development.          With US President Donald Trump’s administration turning its back on internationalism, China has stepped forward to assume the mantle of global leadership. But can China really provide the alternative solutions needed to keep the engines of globalization running? The post-war liberal order has been in serious trouble since the 2008 financial crisis, which weakened Western economies and undermined global-governance bodies and regulatory institutions. According to International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde, emerging economies accounted for over 80 percent of global growth in the aftermath of the crisis, and now contribute 60pc of global GDP. Meanwhile, emerging powers, particularly China and Russia, have further undermined key liberal institutions and values.Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and intervention in Syria have challenged principles of humanitarian interventionism such as the “responsibility to protect” (R2P) and a rising China is confronting the West’s supremacy – in hard- and soft-power terms – in the post-war global order. The previous US administration responded to these developments by trying to create a liberal order 2.0, and by pursuing a strategic pivot to salvage the status quo in Asia. Many observers have focused on America’s goal of preventing Chinese regional dominance. But the US also wanted to defend and strengthen the principles that made post-war Asia’s success possible – what former US Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell called Asia’s “operating system.” Thus, the Obama administration pursued democracy promotion in Myanmar, enforced rules protecting freedom of navigation at sea and concluded the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement between the US and 11 other Pacific Rim countries. Meanwhile, in December 2015, the US Congress ratified the IMF’s 2010 Quota and Governance Reforms; and in October 2016, the IMF Executive Board added the Chinese renminbi to the basket of currencies comprising the fund’s unit of account, Special Drawing Rights. If Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 US presidential election, we would now be seeing a continued US-led effort to reinvigorate and preserve the longstanding status quo in Asia and beyond. But with Trump in office, many fear that existing international arrangements could soon be upended. America’s interest in maintaining the liberal world order stems from its role as what political scientists call a “responsible fiduciary” and “privilege taker” in that system. But Trump sees US hegemony as a burden, and seems oblivious to the privileges that it affords, not least the many benefits associated with controlling the world’s main reserve currency. But, at the same time, Trump does not want to cede America’s global preeminence, which means that he could show a penchant for trade wars, or even military conflicts. In considering China’s role in such a world, it is worth noting a fundamental shift in Chinese thinking since the late 2000s, away from concern with international status and toward a narrower focus on national rejuvenation, or the “Chinese Dream.” For example, an analysis of Chinese media by Harvard University’s Alastair Iain Johnston concludes that, “Instead of a focus on anti-foreign ‘hostile forces,’ Xi’s primary ideological message is the ‘great revival of the Chinese nation.’” Foreign-policy realists define great-power status in terms of a country’s self-perception or material capacities. For China, however, status is conceived in the context of its relationship with the established authority, namely the West. Starting in the 1990s, China began to see the US and the West as representing the global mainstream. While Chinese leaders might not aspire to join the West, they have certainly sought its recognition. They do not want China to be perceived as a hostile revisionist power, and cast into the “out group” of the existing order. This is why China began to gravitate toward the West and seek further integration into the global economy. The government’s reformist ideology dictated that China “connect with the international track.” But, after the 2008 financial crisis, the Chinese suddenly discovered that the “international track” was in trouble. By necessity, but also by choice, China has since become a self-centered, “post-responsible” power. It is now less constrained by the status quo, and more intent on changing it. Fortunately, China is not acting like a traditional revisionist power, and it remains deeply committed to economic globalization. Chinese leaders see their country as the new engine of that process. Since 2013, Xi has been rolling out China’s massive “one belt, one road” program, designed to stimulate growth through global connectivity and infrastructure investment. China does not want a divided Asia or fragmented regional blocs built along geopolitical fissures, so it is cultivating international comity through shared interests. But China will face a unique set of problems as it tries to carry the torch of economic globalization forward. For starters, it is still a developing country, and its domestic landscape is fraught with political perils and economic uncertainties. Xi’s government is struggling to maintain domestic stability as it moves China away from labor-intensive, investment-heavy economic growth toward a model based on domestic consumption and services. The primacy of this domestic agenda means that China’s attempt to lead global change will lack a clear vision and coherent strategy. A second problem stems from China’s incomplete transition on the world stage. After prevailing in World War II, the US immediately and undeniably dominated the globe. China, in seeking to lead the next stage of economic globalization, enjoys no such geopolitical power and legitimacy. Observers in the West and the developing world question whether the solutions China is offering are genuine public goods, many suspect that China’s “one belt, one road” initiative, for example, is a self-serving, unilaterally imposed scheme. That uncertainty underscores a central point: While the liberal world order could be in trouble, a Chinese-led alternative is not yet discernible.Yong Deng is professor of political science at the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.","/opinion/25420-can-china-save-the-global-order.html"
"119",119,"Stuck between China and the US",2017-03-17,"Opinion","Southeast Asia is looking for a precarious balance between the United States and China in order to feel more secure in the region, worried as it is by the behaviour of these two giants in its orbit.           Watching cautiously as Washington and Beijing test each other’s responses in the early months of a Donald Trump presidency – and while China shows little let-up in its assertive behaviour in the disputed waters of the South China Sea – Southeast Asia would find ideal a healthy degree of tension between the two countries, one that is enough to keep a string taut enough without snapping.In other words, enough of a US presence that would not be too in-your-face and draw China’s ire, but not too weak as to allow Beijing to continue to assert its power in a Southeast Asia unable to find the voice to speak up to the country to its north.“We don’t want a shooting war with China, but we want I think the US to come in, show a bit more muscle and action as a way of enabling Southeast Asian countries to regain a new balance now that China has taken over much of the region,” Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University, told a forum on Asian views of the US role this month.“What Asians hope for is something that is neither all conflict or all cooperation in the US-China relationship,” said Ellen Laipson, president emeritus of the Washington DC-based Stimson Centre.“They don’t want a G-2 world in which the US and China are so close that they make decisions for everybody else, but nor do they want the US-China relationship so conflictual that there is this constant worry about ‘will this turn into hot conflict?’” she explained. “So something in between – a friendly, competitive relationship where the US and China will cooperate in some arenas and they will disagree and compete in others.”The geopolitical environment is far from reassuring for Southeast Asia, including Asean countries that pride themselves on being able to hold their own amid bigger powers. While Asean lauds its achievements in regional security as it marks its 50th anniversary, its weakness in the face of China’s presence – economic, political and military – is evident. Dealing with China is a major test of Asean’s centrality and unity.China has been making deep, wide inroads, not least in projecting hard power. Over the years, it has built man-made structures in the South China Sea, occupied some reefs that were held by other claimantcountries – structures that can no longer be removed.If China’s moves to dam the Mekong River’s upstream reaches drew some protests from Southeast Asian countries in the early 90s, these days they pretty much live with this reality and are part of China’s own regional mechanism for the river, called the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation. Beijing has been busy with cooperation plans with various countries, the latest being Cambodia, on its “One Belt, One Road” initiative.Chinese investment is growing in Asean countries. According to Asean Investment Report 2016, China’s foreign direct investment in Asean rose 17 percent to $8.2 billion (288.7 billion baht) in 2015, compared to that of the EU which fell 20pc to $20 billion, and the US by 17pc to $12.2 billion. China is the top investor in the Lao PDR, Cambodia and Myanmar.China has moved to limit or block public reference to and criticism of its actions in the South China Sea and shown little tolerance for countries like Singapore – current coordinator for Asean-China relations – that it finds uncooperative.In September 2016, China successfully lobbied for the rejection by Venezuela, host of the Non-Aligned Movement summit, of the inclusion of updates about Southeast Asia that refer to the South China Sea, as requested by Laos, Asean chair that year. Beijing accused Singapore of pushing to bring up the issue, which Singapore denied.Only in March did the tone of Chinese commentaries change after a bilateral meeting. ‘Reference News’, published by Xinhua news agency, said: “Singapore seems to finally realise the stakes involved.”In June 2016, Asean, under Chinese pressure, retracted a foreign ministers’ statement expressing “serious concerns” over the tense situation in the South China Sea.“China is winning in Southeast Asia and is winning over Southeast Asia,” Mr Thitinan pointed out.This is why Southeast Asians, while wary of Trump’s statements that point to an inward-looking United States, harbour the hope that his views about the need for a strong US military but avoiding as big a role as the world’s superpower as before and letting other countries look after their own problems, offer a bonus: creating space for other allies to come in multilateral fashion and head off China, analysts say.“It would be ironic if his [Trump’s] administration turns out to be more effective in rebalancing the geopolitical dynamics in Southeast Asia,” said Thitinan, citing a contrast to Barack Obama, who was very vocal about the region but under whose watch China’s presence grew.Southeast Asia hopes “that China’s being all over the place, that this will change, that there will be more balance with US allies, partners and the US itself. Southeast Asia is hoping for a kind of rebalance that works – more of the US, a lot of Japan, a lot of Australia, a bit of India – and less China”, Thitinan added.For now, he said, “Southeast Asia is going to be stuck between a rock and a hard place, or [Chinese Communist Party chief] Xi Jinping and [US President] Donald Trump.”If Trump follows through on his words and takes hostile trade action against China and beefs up military presence in Southeast Asia, this would dramatically heighten tensions between Beijing and the US, and regional instability.But if he does not actually do much despite the strong words, “then China will be all over the region”, Thitinan said. “So either way, it does not put Southeast Asia in a desirable position geopolitically.”Trump’s statements about the US playing less of a global role may have worried Asia given its role as a security guarantor, Laipson said. But his February remarks about boosting the US defence budget to US$603 billion “could strengthen the security pillar that many Asians care about”.At the same time, Laipson added, “If we talk about a very dramatic swing to a very large military US presence in the Asia-Pacific, there will be a Chinese reaction to that that will then move us on a path toward a more adversarial relationship possibly.”It is early days in the Trump presidency, and foreign policy watchers take heart from Trump’s assurance of “100pc” support for Japan after North Korea’s missile launch on March 6. Added Thitinan: “So far, he’s less insane than many people thought.” Johanna Son, a journalist based in Bangkok for 17 years, has followed Southeast Asian affairs for over two decades.

"120",120,"Myanmar and ASEAN a great unknown to Trump",2017-03-16,"Business","Eric Rose is lead director of Herzfeld Rubin Meyer & Rose (“HRMR”), the first US law firm established in Myanmar. HRMR is a founding member of the American Chamber of Commerce Myanmar, and Mr Rose serves on its Executive Committee, and also chairs its HR Committee. In an exclusive interview with the Myanmar Times, he talks about the remaining sanctions on Myanmar, the new Donald Trump government and the challenges for American investors to enter the market.          You’ve been in the United States in the past few weeks. Have you gotten a feel for what US President Donald Trump’s broad policies towards Myanmar and ASEAN may be, or is the region a “great unknown” to him?In my opinion, it is a great unknown to him. Although he has licensed two projects in the Philippines, I don’t believe that he truly understands, at this time, the strategic importance of Myanmar – both in terms of the ASEAN itself, as well as in terms of the new pan-ASEAN policy of the Chinese government. How long do you expect him to formulate his policies in this regard? Is this region high on his agenda?I don’t think the ASEAN is high on his agenda, in particular as even the relationship with China is still developing.Former President Barack Obama lifted most sanctions on Myanmar in October. Could Trump rescind this action? Would that affect the bilateral relations?Yes, he could re-impose sanctions simply by issuing an Executive Order, because the underlying legislation which authorised the US Burma Sanctions is still in effect. The president could, if he wanted to, declare a national emergency concerning Myanmar, notify Congress and re-impose those sanctions. But that is not likely. Frankly, I don’t think that would be within the realm of possibilities, at this point.One should note, however, that President Obama has not removed all the sanctions against Myanmar. In particular, the 2003 financial sanctions under Section 312 of the USA Patriot Act continue to be in effect. These sanctions, administered by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [FinCEN], which is part the US Treasury Department, primarily target US financial institutions, as well as banks which have operations in the US. The provisions of Section 312, as applied to Myanmar, require financial institutions to undertake “enhanced due diligence” investigations of transactions with Myanmar. It’s been shown that these continued sanctions have a chilling effect on the actions of US banks and financial institutions,and, more broadly, on a number of financial institutions in Myanmar.Why didn’t Obama lift the sanctions under section 312 of the Patriot Act, and what are their impact on Myanmar’s investment climate for both American firms and multinationals? In my opinion, the primary reason why the application of section 312 to Myanmar continues is due to the ideological bent of the Obama administration in its foreign policy. President Obama tried to strike a balance between the human rights community, on the one hand, and the business community, on the other.  Especially after all other countries dropped their sanctions against Myanmar in 2012, the latter group has been urging the administration since then for relief from the sanctions. These pervasive sanctions, which have been multi-layered against Myanmar for almost 30 years by eight consecutive administrations, both Democrat and Republican, have done nothing but enhanced the financial position of successive military governments, and that of their cronies who were the main targets of these sanctions, while contributing to the impoverishment of the Myanmar people.For example, U Tay Za, the first Myanmar billionaire according to Forbes, before the sanctions were imposed in 2003 had a net worth of about US$250 million. If you fast forward ten years to 2012, during which time both his family and businesses were made subject to sanctions, his net worth is now estimated to be in excess of one billion dollars. The same applies to U Zaw Zaw [Max Myanmar], Steven Law [Asia World], and the other cronies. In the meantime, Myanmar became the second poorest country in Asia, based on GNP per capita according to the World Bank, with an appalling human rights record.  There is no empirical evidence that these sanctions have contributed to either an improvement of the Myanmar human rights record, or of the rights of ethnic minorities, or of the rights of women in Myanmar, etc.  It was purely an ideological decision made by the Obama administration.My hope is that, if one believes the rhetoric of President Trump, at some point in time, the Treasury, Commerce and State Departments are going to revisit these remaining sanctions and say “why are we still having them?” As of now, the effect of the remaining sanctions does nothing but punishes the poor, the farmers in Myanmar and the young entrepreneurs in the cities who are not able to work with or for American companies, or companies financed with American capital, while, at the same time, discouraging trade with and investment from the US.Specifically, what is the impact of the USA Patriot Act on the local banking sector?One should not exaggerate the effect of this American law on the local banking sector. Banks in Myanmar are being kept under the thumb of the Central Bank, which has set up extraordinarily punitive rules that do not allow the local banks to grow, or compete internationally, or even borrow or receive a capital infusion from abroad.The Central Bank has set fixed interest rates for both deposits and lending, for short periods of time, with no market competition between domestic banks. It allows most loans to be taken for only one year, and some can be extended to three years. There is practically no business which will finance its capital investment for that short period of time. Another example is the lending interest rate, also mandated by the Central Bank, which is capped at 13%, with deposit rates set at 8%.  This margin does not allow the banks to compete with microfinance companies, for example, which are allowed to lend with interest rates up to 30%, and pay 15% interest on deposits.Furthermore, with limited exceptions, the Central Bank does not allow foreign banks to offer most services in Myanmar, even in joint ventures, which, if permitted, would allow for a substantial amount of know-how and technology to enter, and, furthermore, enhance the capitalisation of the financial sector in Myanmar. Add to that the restrictions on the Western banks which are imposed by Section 312, and you have this chilling effect, which has kept most Western banks, and all American financial institutions, away from Myanmar.To understand the depth of the “chilling effect” on US banks, there are no American banks that undertake trade finance with Myanmar, or that finance investment in Myanmar, or repatriate profits from Myanmar for US companies.We are an American law firm, owned 100% by Americans. My firm in New York has been around since 1948, which is as long as Myanmar has been independent. Yet, if I want to dividend up to my partners in New York, we couldn’t do that directly. It would have to be done through a corresponding bank in a different country. And then, any transfer would have to be restricted because of the Central Bank having to be involved and the restrictions on the convertibility of the kyat into dollars, which is a combination of both domestic and international restrictions.So the Section 312 is like a wet  blanket over an otherwise very restricted banking system in Myanmar.What is the likelihood of Trump lifting these financial sanctions soon? Would scrapping them be high on his foreign policy agenda?I honestly believe that if somebody will make Steven Mnuchin, the new Secretary of the Treasury, or Wilbur Ross [Secretary of Commerce], or Rex Tillerson [Secretary of State] aware of the effect of these remaining sanctions, they probably will consider removing them soon. But they have other priorities which are higher at this point. What other sanctions remain and how do they affect the investment climate?There are remaining sanctions under the drug kingpin law [Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, and other related legislation].  Those sanctions are also administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control [OFAC], which had administered the US Burma Sanctions. But these sanctions mostly affect individuals and businesses affiliated with the United Wa. Outside of the United Wa territory, there are relatively few businesses controlled by the United Wa. Yangon Airways is one exception.Other sanctions involve the remaining “black list” of individuals prohibited from travelling to the US under the Jade Act. Even though that act is no longer in effect, the list is still active. There are practically no SDNs [Specially Designated Nationals] on that list, yet, most are people who are related to people who used to be SDNs. The result is that a large percentage of the Myanmar economy is closed to US businesses, as it would be hard to imagine a substantial relationship with a party which cannot travel to the US.Another issue is the exploration of natural resources by minorities protected by armed groups.  There is a Reuters story that came out late last year having to do with tin exploration in Myanmar. The major reserves of tin in Myanmar are primarily in the United Wa territory. The Wa brought in Chinese companies to mine the tin deposits to a point that Myanmar became, for the last couple of years, one of the top three producers of tin in the world.Why is that important? It’s because my iPad has tin, lots of tins in it. Motorola phone? Lots of tin. More likely than not, some of that tin actually comes from Myanmar because most of these products are made in China. China’s tin is currently sourced, in large part, from the United Wa territory. In this case it creates an issue of how these sanctions are put into effect.  It is very hardto follow the money trail once it goes into China. Any product that comes out of China and which may have tin from Myanmar’s United Wa territory is hard to trace, as the tin has been co-mingled some places in China. The ability of OFAC to follow that trail is minimal.You told the media last month that the sanctions imposed by the US “have created for many public companies interested in Myanmar trade and investment a public relations issue”. Could you elaborate on this?In a nutshell, Myanmar has suffered for over 60 years from mismanagement by its own governments. The result of that has been an impoverishment of the country in becoming the second poorest country in Asia, and also a combination of human rights abuses, lack of rule of law, and an economy that is tremendously suffering, except for a chosen few. Then-Burma was the richest country in terms of GNP [gross national product] per capita in 1948. It was then the largest producer of rice, beans, pulses, teak, rubies and jade in the world, as well as a large producer of many other natural resources, including having the estimated tenth largest global natural gas reserves. And yet, in the span of this rather short historic period, Myanmar went from the top in the ASEAN to the poorest country. That happened not because they were invaded by another country; it was primarily because of mismanagement by its own successive governments, and the effect of sanctions which were imposed on the country over 30 years, primarily by the US, which resulted in an enormous number of job losses, especially after 2003.As an example, from a 2006 study done by the Congressional Budget Office,the effect of the 2003 sanctions against Myanmar was that over 60,000 Myanmar workers, primarily women, lost their jobs in the textile sector alone. More than 200 factories were closed. Each family in Myanmar supports about five to six people, and these workerswere mostly the primary bread winners in their families. So, about half a million people were affected in just in one industry by this particular set of sanctions.The sanctions that were imposed by successive US administrations have created an environment for American companies in which US businesses did not want to come and even look at Myanmar opportunities. Numerous companies have pulled out over the years, the result of which is that the total amount of American FDI in Myanmar is less than US$300 million dollars. There is some investment that has come through Singapore, but that is relatively speaking negligible when you are looking at the total FDI investment of over US$40 billion. We have fallen from the 13th largest investor to somewhere around the 15th, according to the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration [DICA].The American Chamber of Commerce in Myanmar [AMCHAM], which groups and advocates for the interests of the US business community, as well as for other businesses interested in trade with the US, has a few dozen American members – not because AMCHAM is not good at what it’s doing, but because the US business community has been discouraged for so long to invest in, or even trade with Myanmar.Many are not coming here because of the public relations issue that they have to deal with in the US: Are you investing in a country that is oppressing the minorities, oppressing the Rohingyas, oppressing this ... oppressing that? They never hear about the good stories that come out of Myanmar. Or, for that matter, the fact that Myanmar, a country which has held two free elections in the last five years, which elections have brought a true change of government recognised by the Tatmadaw, and is about to hold a third free election, is being held to a different standard than its neighbours.Thailand no longer has free elections, Laos, Vietnam and China have not had free elections, Malaysia, Cambodia and Singapore are ruled by the same families for dozens of years, and several also have appalling human rights records.  Yet, there are no sanctions against any of them to speak of.  The election of the NLD government is the first major positive story coming out of Myanmar in recent years, and even that is now being tarnished by human rights organisations. The issues in northern Rakhine State, as well as the continuing civil conflict between the Myanmar army and some of the minority groups under arms, are somehow extrapolated to the entire country, without any discernible recognition for the progress made in race relations nationwide, or of how complicated the political issues are here. So, American companies coming into Myanmar have to deal not only with economic issues, some of which we discussed earlier, but they also have to deal with a public relations or image issue.How can the public relations issue be resolved?Myanmar has to continue to do a lot of things, all at the same time, many of which will require the cooperation of the Tatmadaw.  First, though, from an economic standpoint, the government should take the measures which will allow it to get a sovereign credit rating. A lot of things that Myanmar cannot do today are as a result of the lack of financing, primarily because of its very poor tax collection system, and limited access to debt markets.The income tax system, for example, is antiquated, as it is based on income estimates as opposed to actual numbers, due to the lack of accounting for many Myanmar SMEs. The moment Myanmar gets a sovereign credit rating, it can start entering the international financial market in conjunction with the dropping of the remaining US financial sanctions. This will provide it with funds to improve its tax collection, restructure its legal system, and create a policy of promoting Myanmar through commercial centres in the US, Japan, China, Singapore, India, Canada, Australia, the UK and Continental Europe, among others, which will promote the image of the country as being open for business with foreigners.  Obviously, there are a number of economic, legal and financial restructuring measures which need to be taken domestically, in order to enhance the opportunities of both foreign and domestic investors. Furthermore, Myanmar needs to enter into bilateral investment and double taxation treaties with a number of countries, and specifically with the EU, the UK and the US.Improving Myanmar’s image will help American companies with their public relations issues. After all, we helped introduce CSR [corporate social responsibility] to Myanmar, have brought numerous training opportunities for Myanmar young people, and especially students, through continuous outreach and sponsorship. For example, AMCHAM sponsors every year 35 students from the University of Yangon and Yangon University of Economics, which is the largest program of its kind in the country. Individual American investors have contributed to creating centers of excellence, re-writing investment legislation, expand interactions with domestic entrepreneurs, etc.  But these initiatives get lost in the “white noise” created by human rights organisations with no counter balance from the Myanmar government.There is almostno Myanmar government voice to talk about the good things that are happening in the country, which we see every day. The NLD government has undertaken enormous steps forward, in a short year, which have helped promote understanding with minority groups, improved education, healthcare, andpromoted investment – the whole new investment law is targeted specifically at investment in minority areas. Yet, the NLD government has made all of these efforts, and practically nobody knows about it outside of Myanmar.AMCHAM talks about it. I talk about it. The US Chamber of Commerce, and numerous other foreign Chambers talk about it. But our voice is a “white” voice. It is what the Myanmar people call Naing Ngan Jar Thar, which means a foreigner. It is a foreigner’s voice. Businesses need to hear from the NLD government, to hear from Daw Suu, from U Thin Kyaw, from U Win Thein, from the leaders of the NLD, as well as from the UMFCCI and its many federations, who can tell the rest of the world why now is finally the time for the world to take notice of the positive changes in Myanmar.  In other words, come to this country and see for yourself!","/business/25352-myanmar-and-asean-a-great-unknown-to-trump.html"
"121",121,"Belt and Road sparks investor interest: HKTDC",2017-02-24,"Business","The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) led a delegation to visit Myanmar to meet with businesses, investors and government departments earlier this week. Their regional director spoke exclusively to the Myanmar Times on how China’s One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative could be a game changer for Myanmar’s position in the international economy.          Having met officials from the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA) on February 21, Peter Wong, the head of the delegation and also HKTDC regional director (Southeast Asia and India), spoke to the Myanmar Times about trade relations between Hong Kong and Myanmar, as well as the prospect of Myanmar in China’s One Belt One Road initiative.When asked whether trade relations between Hong Kong and Myanmar have changed under the NLD-led government, Mr Wong thinks that the new civilian-led government has realised that their national economy can only take off with foreign investments. And infrastructure has a key role to play.“Infrastructure is underdeveloped ... [For example,] a lot of friends have told me about the lack of electricity here ... without electricity, investors would be hesitant to set up factories here. The same applies for other infrastructural support such as roads and bridges,” he said. Trade relations have not been significantly altered.From 2011-12 to 2016-17, Hong Kong accounted for 3.9 percent of FDIs, ranking fourth after Singapore, China and the UK. However, he believes there is a lot more Hong Kong can do.“Although Hong Kong ranks fourth in terms of FDI ... a lot of people are actually not aware of [the potential] of the Myanmar market. This is partly due to the impression Myanmar used to have to the outside world, which is relatively negative. Apart from manufacturers, other sectors were reluctant to venture into this market,” he said.But that is about to change, and it is not merely because of a transition from a military regime to a democracy.The game changer for Myanmar’s position in the international economy, according to Mr Wong, is China’s One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative.In 2013, China's president, Xi Jinping, proposed an economic and trade program --creating a network of roads, ports, railways, pipelines and utility grids which would link China and Central Asia, West Asia, and parts of South Asia. According to McKinsey and Co, OBOR aims to create the world’s largest platform for economic cooperation, including policy coordination, trade and financing collaboration, and social and cultural cooperation. OBOR is expected to boost and finance capital projects and infrastructure in developing economies.“Part of OBOR is a proposal on establishing a China-Myanmar-Bangladesh-India [BCIM] economic corridor. In this corridor, Myanmar acts as an important bridge for commercial activities between China and India. And because of that, there is an increase of interest among Hong Kong investors and Hong Kong companies to look at the Myanmar market.“OBOR prioritises infrastructure, and that requires professional services which Hong Kong is very strong, to take off in Myanmar,” he added, citing services industry and professional services as the city’s strengths.“We [Hong Kong] are strong in real estate-related services, such as construction, surveying, engineering, project planning, town planning and so on.“The focus among Hong Kong investors regarding Myanmar has diversified from manufacturing to a much wider spectrum of interests,” he said, expecting the financial centre to increase its investments in Myanmar in the next few years.“Chinese investors, international investors and investors in the rest of Southeast Asia can make use of Hong Kong as a platform to invest in Myanmar ... Hong Kong uses a common law legal system and Myanmar has a similar legal system to the UK ... Hong Kong will be a good arbitration centre for companies investing and operating in Myanmar. This would attract companies to use Hong Kong as a platform.”Mr Wong expects the territories traditional main investments in Myanmar – electronic products and garment industry – will continue and grow. And what are the potential sectors apart from professional services?“Agriculture, jade and jewellery are fields which Hong Kong can explore. Hong Kong is a leader in jewellery design and there could be a lot of partnership potential in this regard.”What does he think the Myanmar government can do more to attract Hong Kong investors to Myanmar?“I think this is about promotion. The Myanmar government should promote more to international investors about what Myanmar can offer. For example, will new investment laws offer tax incentives, employee benefits or other incentives?“Instead of dealing with multiple ministries, can there be a one-stop centre to streamline the bureaucracy and procedures? How can the government deal with the problem of the lack of electricity? How can they sort out labour disputes? The government should explain how they can support investors on these issues.”Using China as an example, Mr Wong showed how the administration can attract investors by helping them establish their operations and businesses efficiently without red tape. In terms of manufacturing, Myanmar can learn from China's example of how to successfully in attract investments.“It is about promotion,” he repeated.“Many Hong Kong people still have an impression based on the old military regime: Is the government very corrupt? Is the country very backward? Are the people very anti-Chinese?” he said, emphasising the need for Myanmar to promote itself on the international arena more pro-actively. At the same time, he is keen for the HKTDC to organise more trade visits to Myanmar.","/business/25081-belt-and-road-sparks-investor-interest-hktdc.html"
"122",122,"Exports prioritised to meet trade target",2017-02-23,"Business","According to official figures from the Ministry of Commerce, trade volume reached US$23 billion until the end of January in this fiscal year. The ministry has set the target trade volume to be $31 billion, therefore the ministry will continue trying to achieve its target over the next two months, said U Khin Maung Lwin, deputy secretary from the Ministry of Commerce.           “Many imports have declined [in terms of volume]. Cement import has also fallen. Natural gas export has also fallen by billions of tonnes. At present, we are trying to reach our target $31 billion,” he said. Natural gas is Myanmar’s main export and major source of export revenue. The sector has struggled amid decline in global oil prices.The official figures suggest that there was a total of trade worth more than $23 billion from the start of the fiscal year until February 10, slightly up from more than $22 billion in the same period last year.Until the end of February 2017, over a span of 10 months, the total import volume was slightly above $13 billion. Thus, the volume fell by almost $450 million this year when compared to the $14 billion in the same period last year.Import of investment goods amounted to $5420 million and commercial raw materials $4857 million. Consumer goods of more than $3262 million have also been imported, according to the Ministry.The Ministry of Commerce has set a target for the import volume to reach $17 billion before the next fiscal year.However, so far the volume has just amounted to some $13 billion, resulting from a decline in importing goods into the country as well as a sharp drop in cement import, said U Khin Maung Lwin.The cement import has fallen by $121 million or 1.4 million tonnes compared to the same period last year. This change is due to a significant increase in domestic production, he explained.In contrast, export reached $9663 million from the start of the fiscal year until February 10, up from $9159 million in the same period last year.Therefore, import revenues have fallen by $450 million while exports have increased by more than $500 million.Although, exports have increased, the main national export product – natural gas – has lost nearly a billion dollars in trade, and agricultural exports, such as rice, have also dropped due to bad weather, floods and seizures by the Chinese government in an attempt to crack down on illegal border trade, according to the civil servant.“The current [level of] natural gas export of the nation has plunged and billions of dollars has been lost. The natural gas export dip is really noticeable,” another official added, “But this also meant that the amount of goods in the private sectors [which were exported] has risen. We can now only export about $2.4 billion worth of natural gas. Previously, the amount was up to $3.7 billion, so there was a drop of $1.3 billion worth of gas export.”In December, the Myanmar Times reported that, as of December 9, the country had earned US$1.82 billion from selling natural gas abroad, compared to $3 billion by the same stage in the previous fiscal year, U Khin Maung Lwin remarked at that time. The impact on export revenues has continued since then.The drop in gas export earnings is particularly worrying given that natural gas has typically accounted for around half of total export earnings in any given financial year.The rice exports were estimated to be down by 200,000 tonnes, but have increased in the field of border trade. The trend was disrupted between September and November, during which border trade was hard hit by a crackdown on illegal trade by China.Last October, industry insiders reported that many farmers faced serious losses as the Chinese border authorities tightened controls over the import of agricultural products from Myanmar, including rice, maize, sugar and beans.At that time, Myanmar Rice Federation (MRF) joint secretary U Nay Lin Zin told the Myanmar Times that Myanmar has no real market for its rice except for China.“But China has now reduced its import volume fivefold,” he said, adding that Myanmar was exporting about 5000 tonnes of rice a day to China at the Muse border gate, but the volume was reduced to less than 1000 tonnes.“I think China is trying to stop illegal border trade completely. We have to start looking for new markets or other solutions,” said U Nay Lin Zin.It remains to be seen how the situation of border trade could be completely resolved.The export revenues in various sectors were: (1) more than $2362 million deriving from agricultural products, (2) more than $8 million from animal products, (3) more than $470 million from fisheries, (4) above $813 million from minerals, (5) above $204 million from forest products, (6) above $4497 million from finished industrial goods, and (7) more than $1306 million from other types of products. Finished industrial goods topped the revenue table while animal products contributed the least.“Private sector exports, in the area of cut-make-pack garments, have increased up to $800 million,” said U Khin Maung Lwin.The three months covering September, October and November witnessed a series of floods affecting the entire country, disrupting agriculture and manufacture sectors.The Ministry of Commerce has also carried out re-export plans in order to stem the tide of falling trade activities.Nevertheless, to meet the target of having $31 billion in exports before the start of the next fiscal year, attempts will be made to achieve the remaining $7 billion, and exports will be prioritised to accomplish the task, said U Khin Maung Lwin. – Translation by Zar Zar Soe and Kyaw Soe Htet","/business/25069-exports-prioritised-to-meet-trade-target.html"

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) marks 50th anniversary this year after it was established on 8 August 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand. The founding members of ASEAN, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand signed a short document, known as the Bangkok Declaration.One of its main priorities is “to accelerate the economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region through joint endeavors in the spirit of equality and partnership in order to strengthen the foundations for a prosperous and peaceful community of Southeast Asian Nations”.To do so, the ASEAN member countries have to meet and discuss all the time to make sure that they can reach a consensus. Therefore, it is not surprising that every year ASEAN holds at least one thousand  meetings to work out programs, action plans and other activities that would strengthen the grouping’s integration. One can say that ASEAN has been quite successful for the past 50 years because it has preserved peace and prosperity in the region.In the next fifty years, ASEAN would be different and become more dynamic because there are new regional players joining the grouping. Since 1995-1999, ASEAN has expanded from six to ten members including Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia. Before the latest enlargement, ASEAN was often branded as a club of dictatorship because of the nature of their leaders and political systems. Today, it is different. For example, Vietnam and Myanmar are both taking the lead in improving the ASEAN profile. Vietnam has concluded the largest amount of free trade agreements with foreign countries, 17 in all and 6 more pending, even though its economy is totally market-driven. With a democratically elected government under the leadership of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, one of the world’s most famous democratic icon, ASEAN will never be the same again. In fact, the grouping is incrementally becoming more people-centered—more responsive to people’s demands.After the dramatic reforms took place in Myanmar beginning 2010, a new political landscape has been emerging. The country’s political transition has moved forward quickly. The quasi-civilian government of President U Thein Sein institued many wide-ranging measures to promote freedom of expression and widen political participation for political parties and ordinary people. That helped explain why the National League for Democracy (NLD), the opposition party and its leader, Suu Kyi, was able to take part in the political process, which eventually led the NLD to form a national government.In 2015 election, NLD won majority seats in all the parliaments at regional and national levels and Suu Kyi led the new democratic government in March, 2016. Myanmar’s wide-ranging transformation brings a lot of attention from the region and beyond. With her reputation and desire to move the country forward, she has assumed a dual role as the country’s State Counselor and Minister of Foreign Affairs.With the new NLD-led government in Naypyidaw, many questions were raised about the role of Myanmar inside ASEAN. Most importantly, it was about the prospect of Suu Kyi and her relations with ASEAN. After all, during her years fighting for democracy and human rights, ASEAN turned the other way—no support whatsoever. It is well known the ASEAN leaders did not show any concern about Suu Kyi’s plight, instead, they cajoled with the military leaders. Obviously, some the ASEAN countries have national  and economic interests in mind. That helped explain why the ASEAN leaders were so reluctant to stand for Suu Kyi’s convictions. For a while, there were speculations that she might be anti-ASEAN because she was a strong personality and driven by principles.In retrospect, Suu Kyi did have a good impression of ASEAN before Myanmar was admitted as an observer in 1995. She was hopeful that ASEAN would eventually serve as a counterbalance to the strong military government at the time.However, she was wrong. Immediately after Myanmar became an ASEAN observer, Naypyidaw waited no time to pressure the Yangon-based ASEAN diplomats to call off a scheduled meeting with Suu Kyi. She was extremely disappointed. After that, she seldom mentioned ASEAN.“She expected ASEAN would protect her and uphold human rights and the rights of ASEAN citizens but it did not happen,” said Kavi Chongkittavorn, Bangkok-based regional commentator. “That did not happen,  she did not trust the ASEAN leaders.”However, during her first public appearance after taking over the government in April 2016, Suu Kyi said Myanmar would be actively involved within ASEAN and beyond.” This has always been our aim that our country should always be the ground for fostering better relations not just  with our neighbours but ourselves and  the rest of the world,” she said the audience, including diplomats based here.According to Daw Moe Thuzar, a fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Singapore, Suu Kyi will present new opportunities for Myanmar to assume a greater role in ASEAN and international affairs. “It is a new beginning for Myanmar’s regional and international cooperation with new directions.”The NLD-led government has reiterated continuity with non-alignment in the conduct of foreign policy. Furthermore, Suu Kyi has emphasized the importance of ASEAN’s rules-based principles in bilateral and multilateral partnerships, commented Daw Moe Thuzar in one of her articles.Gradually and steadily Myanmar’s status in ASEAN has improved. The country has been recognized both regionally and internationally through its engagement with ASEAN in recent years. Indeed, after skipping from the chairmanship of ASEAN in 2006, Myanmar did a marvelous job in carrying out its chairmanship in 2014 by promoting the ASEAN unity and centrality. Myanmar was quite active in promoting integration and regionalization of ASEAN as well as ties with dialogue partners. Myanmar was able to display its diplomatic finesse and wisdom through ASEAN-led meetings and summits.Numerous international meetings and conventions were also held here, giving abundant exposure to the country’s leaders and the People of Myanmar.Myanmar’s image has suddenly turned around from a pariah state to a well-known country with democracy and free press. So, the country has escaped all the suffering and pressured emanating the West and dialogue countries. With new confidence, Myanmar has inviting foreign investors to come and invest. Tourism industry has enjoyed a rapid influx of foreign visitors. Last year, there were more four million tourists. Several years back, there were less then forty thousand visitors annually.There were a number of key achievements for Myanmar in previous government, according to Daw Moe Thuzar. “The government recognized the need to start political reform and affect change in the country.”“ASEAN has expressed their concern whenever there were developments in Myanmar that regressed from the path towards reconciliation and democracy,” she said. Myanmar continues to benefit from various cooperation initiatives under various ASEAN frameworks. These engagements help the country to build capacities to take active role in the effort to promote community-building and regional integration.After five decades of dictatorship, Myanmar emerged as an unlikely beacon of democracy in Southeast Asia. The question now is how Myanmar’s first democratically elected government will deal with its ASEAN partner – whether it will continue the engaged approach adopted by previous government or a more hands-off stance to focus on the country’s domestic challenges, said Oxford Business Group’s report in 2016. The ultimate goal of ASEAN is to reach to a peaceful and prosperous community where ASEAN will be outward looking, playing a leading role in emerging regional architecture.The NLD-led government has already laid down the people-centered foreign policy as well as the ASEAN policy, according to U Myint Thu, Director General of ASEAN Affairs, MOFA. “Daw Aung San Suu Kyi contributed her thoughts and visions in foreign ministers meetings and summits in Laos. She stressed to maintain ASEAN Centrality, courage and consistency in promoting the role of ASEAN and ASEAN’s decision making process,” he told Myanmar Times this week.In August, Suu Kyi joined ASEAN meetings in Laos for the first time and the ASEAN leaders welcomed and appreciated her contribution, said U Myint Thu. “She earned respects from ASEAN leaders. She pointed out that if ASEAN want to be global leader, it needs unity. The influence of any powerful country can affect ASEAN unity.”As state counselor, Suu Kyi visited Thailand and Singapore as a part of newly initiated people-centered foreign policy.Myanmar and Thailand signed a number of agreements to bolster border trade and enhance protection of the rights of Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand. During the visit to Singapore, the island republic confirmed its support for the NLD-led government in all areas.Bangkok-based analyst, Kavi told the Myanmar Times recently that “The Myanmar-ASEAN ties are very good under Suu Kyi even though there were skepticism in the beginning. She would like to increase engagement with ASEAN. She realizes that ASEAN can help Myanmar with economic development and regional integration.”The NLD government’s policy towards ASEAN will be part of the overall directions for the country’s foreign policy which continues along the path of remaining independent. It is deciding the country’s position regarding international and regional issues without taking sides, said Daw Moe Thuzar. “As an ASEAN member since 1997, Myanmar is also aware of the priority placed on ASEAN’s unity of purpose,” she said.Indeed, Myanmar’s membership in ASEAN and relation with neighboring and major powers is also critical for ASEAN – Myanmar relation in Daw Aung San Suu Kyi time.The rise of China has become an important political agenda not only for Myanmar but also for the ASEAN member countries. They are worried about China – Myanmar relations because in the past the two countries were very closed. China strongly backed Myanmar before the current reform efforts. China is Myanmar’s long standing friend which was described as a brotherhood relationship.The China – Myanmar relation has taken a new turn once the later moved toward democratization  in 2010. Myanmar’s quasi civilian government under the former president U Thein Sein preferred to look toward the US as a model for openness. Somehow, this preference impacted on the China-Myanmar ties, especially on the investment from China.Their ties became uncertainty due to dramatic changes inside Myanamr. But the two countries’ leaders met in Beijing in 2013 to reconfirm their mutual beneficial friendship and comprehensive strategic partnership.The two countries made a smart and quick move when Myanmar’s long opposition party took power end of 2015. China sent Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Myanmar to meet Suu Kyi as soon as she took office in April 2016. It was the first diplomat meeting with Myanmar’s newly elected democratic government. As a state leader, Suu Kyi made her first visit to China among other major powers giving mutual respect to neighboring power to benefit its’ continual support to Myanmar.As China is a big power, Myanmar wants China to play in positive role in Asia, said Suu Kyi in a exclusive interview with Singapore Channel News Asia in December 2016. “China is a neighbor. We can’t move away from each other. So we have to make sure that we stay as good neighbors. We just have to concentrate on making sure that we establish positive relations with each other,” she said.Myanmar’s relationship with China and its relationship with ASEAN are distinct and do not depend on each other, said Ms Yun Sun, a senior associate of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center, a US based Think Tank Group. She told the Myanmar Times that “The relationship between China – Myanmar is okay and doesn’t have major crisis at the moment. I don’t think particularly issues like the Southeast Sea would sway Myanmar’s regional identity and its support of ASEAN’s agenda.But at least Myanmar faces strategic weight of major powers in a hegemonic context. The US containment strategy aimed at limiting Chinese dominance in Southeast Asia, Japan’s power-balance approach, the two-ocean’ strategy of China, the Act-East policy (Look East Policy) of India as all approach differently according to a thesis paper of Saw Tha Wah at Assumption University of Thailand.The paper was made in 2016 explaining Myanmar’s foreign policy behavior with domestic and international factors. Myanmar has chosen to engage with ASEAN in order to resolve bilateral tensions in multilateral and regional forums, it said.Myanmar’s engagement with ASEAN can assist in managing and resisting the influence of China. Myanmar focuses on cooperating with ASEAN so as to encourage China to participate in regional integration and socialization to take constructive responsibility as regional power. Myanmar needs China’s support for dealing with ethnic armed groups. Beijing has assured support for Myanmar’s peace process which is one of the most important tasks for NLD government. Apart from major investments in the country, Myanmar’s participation in China’s ambitious “Belt and Road Initiative” would also enhance all round relations between Naypyi daw and Beijing.All these major powers would have their own strategic ambitions to Myanmar to utilize the country’s strategic location, as buffer for them especially for China. There is no doubt that Myanmar wants development through regional integration coupling with good relation with everyone.The author thanks Probe Media Foundation Inc. for the Reporting ASEAN Fellowship supported by the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives.","/opinion/24927-suu-kyi-strengthens-ties-with-asean-and-china.html"
"124",124,"MoUs inked to step up Thailand-Myanmar cross-border trade",2017-02-09,"Business","Business communities and the governments of Thailand and Myanmar have agreed on bolstering cross-border trade by improving existing channels and developing new routes, and with an emphasis on the exchange of data and a new cross-border SEZ.           The Thai delegation, led by Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, met with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on February 2. Jatusripitak was also received by President Htin Kyaw at the Credential Hall of the President’s Office in Nay Pyi Taw. In a statement, the President’s Office said the two sides discussed supporting small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), developing the border areas and promoting investment in infrastructure.The deputy PM, who was on his first visit to civilian-administered Myanmar, highlighted the economic importance of border trading for both countries, and announced that both sides agreed to deepen ties by extending and upgrading the Thailand-Myanmar Road.Jatusripitak said that the route – which passes from India to Myanmar and then to Thailand before continuing to Laos and Vietnam – is the main channel connecting the two countries, and hence a pivotal route for the entire region. He said Thailand will take a proactive role in financing the construction of under-developed routes located in Thailand and Myanmar. The deputy PM added that a committee would be formed to support and monitor the development of important routes.While the Mae Sot-Myawaddy border crossing is very important, there are other opportunities on the horizon. If the relevant administrative authorities in Thailand and state or regional chief ministers in Myanmar agree, new gates along the border can serve as cross-border trading routes. Trading along the border will then flourish. With the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community, fostering cross-border trade by integrating the two countries will help penetrate the market, especially those of the CLMV (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam) countries.A total of 16 bilateral business memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were signed. They touched upon bolstering Myanmar-Thailand tourism, improving border trading and collaborating on developing rural areas. The private sectors in the two neighbour countries, led separately by the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) and Union of Myanmar Federation of Chamber and Industry (UMFCCI), signed the memoranda to collaborate in various fields such as infrastructure, communications, construction and agriculture. Strategic partnerships include upgrading Dawei General Hospital, cooperation in fishery industry and a mechanism between Krung Thai Bank and Myanma Economic Bank to ease the procedures for Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand to transfer money.Jatusripitak said that Thailand has plenty of experience in developing industrial and agricultural sectors, both of which have a significant potential in Myanmar. The memoranda are expected to cover the next two to three years.Cross-border trade these days is as much about the exchange of information as it is about the movement of services and goods. The business agreements also encompass developing Myanmar’s SMEs, digital economy, human resources and software standards. Specific ventures named include the products barcode system, widespread usage of GS1 and e-wallet platform systems. The memoranda have emphasised the strengthening of information sharing. Partnering with UMFCCI, the University of Thai Chamber of Commerce (UTCC) and the FTI will develop human resources and share economic research data respectively. The latter would also exchange industrial technologies and software development.“We want to and we have planned to support the export of products made in Myanmar, to Thailand or to the global market,” said Panitarn Pavarolavidya, chair of Thai-Myanmar Business Council and deputy secretary general of FTI.“There is an age-old saying: Myanmar is the farmland, Thailand is the kitchen. We want Myanmar to be the farmland, and also the kitchen, so we will help until Myanmar and Thailand are able to stand equally in the supply change.”There were plans to develop Mae Sot and Myawaddy, separated by the Moei River, into a special economic zone. For that to happen, investments and infrastructure are not adequate: the countries would also explore the need to designate a currency for the SEZ. According to the deputy PM, there would be no problem for road infrastructure support and cargo transport, and the Thai government, working together with the energy sector, has provided plans to its Myanmar counterpart for upgrading existing energy supply facilities.Back in 2013, the Thai government decided to establish an SEZ at the border town of Mae Sot. Dr Mg Mg Lay, then-UMFCCI vice chair, said the zone could bring benefits to both countries.“The establishment of an SEZ in Mae Sot could help the ASEAN Economic Community develop and create more jobs … Workers from Myawaddy in Kayin State on the Myanmar side, could also earn ... later on if the demand for labour is competitive. We have a plan to set up another SEZ in Myawaddy as well,” he said.At that time, Mae Sot customs officials boasted that the border town was located on the projected East-West Economic Corridor Route that would connect Muse, Tamu, Mandalay and Yangon, bringing potential benefits to millions of people.The then-Kayin Chief Minister U Zaw Min also spoke in favour of the Economic Corridor Route, a project backed by the Asian Development Bank which has been years behind schedule on the western Myanmar end of the proposed “corridor”.A 1450-kilometre (900-mile) highway, in various stages of development, was intended to link Vietnam starting in Da Nang with Laos and Thailand and then pass through Kayin state to the port of Mawlamyine at the mouth of the Thanlwin (Salween) river. It was believed that the ambitious venture would facilitate economic integration between Myanmar and Thailand, as well as improving connectivity within the Mekong sub-region.According to the Thai delegation, there are plans submitted to Nay Pyi Taw to authorise and regulate the use of baht in Myanmar to facilitate trade. Thai currency, as well as the Chinese renminbi, are widely used in some parts of Myanmar.Translation by Win Thaw Tar and Kyaw Soe Htet","/business/24884-mous-inked-to-step-up-thailand-myanmar-cross-border-trade.html"

A member of the commission for reviewing and scrutinising hydropower projects along the Ayeyarwady River, speaking on condition of anonymity, said members are preparing to meet to begin research and work on a second report.“I think the meeting will start soon,” he said, adding that although the country’s president (U Htin Kyaw) didn’t give instructions to submit further reports, “the commission has to do it”.The commission is responsible for reviewing the hydropower projects to determine whether they are an environmental hazard – and if the proposed dams are beneficial to residents living in those areas, in particular the Myitsone dam in Kachin State.The previous government signed an agreement in 2006 with a Chinese company to build the Myitsone dam, which is targeted to generate 4600 megawatts of power on the country’s biggest river, the Ayeyarwady.As part of the plan, Chinese company China Power Investment (now Upstream Ayeyarwady Confluence Basin Hydropower Company) set up a new village in 2009 to relocate the residents from Tan Hpre, Pa Tan and Myitsone villages near the hydropower project area.The Chinese company was to jointly develop the dam with a Myanmar company, Asia World Company Ltd. The project was suspended in 2011 by then-president U Thein Sein, who cited widespread public opposition.China's dam problem in MyanmarContributing to Myitsone’s unpopularity was the widespread displacement of populations in the project area, concerns about the dam’s environmental impact and the terms of an agreement that would see some 90 percent of the electricity generated channelled to China.The Myanmar Times tried to get a comment from CPI on this latest delay, but was unable to contact a company representative.The company previously said in a statement that it will continue to make efforts to cooperate with the commission in its investigations.The controversial dam was on the agenda when State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi met Chinese leaders in Beijing last year. Since then, the Myanmar government has deferred making any major decision, saying that it would have to await the results of the Ayeyarwady River Commission’s review.","/national-news/24860-longer-wait-for-final-word-on-myitsone-dam-project.html"
"126",126,"Myanmar garment workers’ rights abuse critical, says report",2017-02-08,"Yangon","Myanmar garment workers’ rights have now reached critical levels under criteria set by international labour laws, a director of the Labour Rights Defenders and Promoters (LRDP) Daw Ei Shwe Zin Nyunt said yesterday.          Her comments came as ‘The Myanmar Dilemma Report” on the condition of garment factory workers in Myanmar was released on February 7 (report pdf).The report was made following investigations conducted by the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (Stichting Onderzoek Multinationale Ondernemingen-SOMO) and Action Labor Rights, and Labour Rights Defenders and Promoters (LRDP) on 12 factories and 400 workers.Twelve factories located in different industrial zones in and around Yangon, Bago and Pathein and Thilawa Special Economic Zone were investigated. Of the 12, three are Myanmar-owned while the other nine factories are foreign-owned – Japanese, Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Chinese and Korean.  The report described a series of labour rights and human rights issues in this industry, including very low wages, unlawful wage deduction (for sick leave, for example), very long working days, unpaid and forced overtime, abuse of apprentices to avoid paying the legal minimum wage, child labour, and unhealthy and unsafe working conditions.The Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) is a critical, independent, not-for-profit knowledge centre investigating multinational corporations and the impact of their activities on people and the environment.Daw Ei Shwe Zin Nyunt said before the report was released to the public, the companies involved were informed of the findings and “had not denied” them.“So they also understood these conditions but they neglected (them) and didn’t take on the issues of workers,” she said.The findings of the report showed that conditions for garment factory workers in Myanmar were “far from fair” and that employers were manipulating the weakness in the labour laws to violate the rights of workers, said director of Action Labor Rights Ko Thurein Aung.“The ministry has the responsibility to control and drive for better protection for the rights of garment employers,” he said.After years of economic isolation, foreign investment is now flowing into  Myanmar after the lifting of economic sanctions. The garment industry, specifically, has benefited greatly from foreign investment and has grown exponentially in recent years.In 2014, Myanmar’s total export value of garments reached US$986 million, nearly tripling the value of the 2010 garment exports of $337 million. According to the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association (MGMA), garment exports totalled $1.46 billion in 2015, accounting for 10 per cent of the country’s export revenues.The European Union is the fastest growing export market for Myanmar garments, with imports achieving a staggering 80 pc growth in 2015  from just three years before.“The rule of law in Myanmar is not adequately upheld,” said SOMO leader Martje Theuws in a statement.“Civil society organisations and trade unions have only been allowed to operate since 2012. The garment industry’s operations go largely unchecked. The question is justified if the time is ripe for foreign companies to invest in Myanmar.”‘’When we checked some factories, we found two wage documents. The first document of employees showed the worker’s wage paid in accordance with the international law on worker wages, but the second document had shown the real wages which violate the law,” Ko Thurein Aung says.When the NLD-led government took office, government organisations were changed and replaced, but the issue of rights abuse persists because service staff and many top officers have not changed, said Action Labor Rights activist Ko Sai Yu Muang.Under the current government, the labour worker issue has been mainly tackled by the two committees of Hluttaw on workers and with the collaboration of the worker unions and the Department of the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population.","/national-news/yangon/24862-myanmar-garment-workers-rights-abuse-critical-says-report.html"

We are demanding the company follow the foreign investment law,” said Ko Tin Myo Tun, a workers’ representative from the Tagaung Taung Nickel Factory in Katha district’s Htigyaing township.He added that he believes the company is violating chapter 13, section 51 of the Myanmar Investment Law, which stipulates that only citizens can be appointed to positions that do not require special skills.Ko Tin Myo Tun said the factory is taking away hundreds of jobs that should belong to the local workers.The factory employs around 1600 Myanmar workers and about 400 Chinese migrant workers, by the protesters’ count.The January 18 protest follows a similar demonstration in December, when around several hundred workers demanded better working conditions and full benefits such as the healthcare and social security plans allegedly offered to their Chinese colleagues.The workers also say that some of their colleagues have been fired for joining in protests to demand their rights.“A worker was fired for protesting last time. The region arbitration council decided the worker should be reappointed this month. But the company has made no contact with him telling him he can come back. I think the case may reach the Nay Pyi Taw arbitration council if the factory is not satisfied with the decision,” said Ko Tin Myo Tun.The Tagaung Taung factory began mining in 2009 after the Ministry of Mines and China Nonferrous Metal Mining Co (CNMC) signed a product-sharing contract in 2009.According to CNMC, the factory provides job opportunities and training to local residents, and the project aims to serve as a “model of cooperation between Chinese and Myanmar in the mining industry”.Translation by San Layy and Khine Thazin Han","/national-news/mandalay-upper-myanmar/24633-nickel-factory-workers-demand-enforcement-of-investment-law.html"
"128",128,"The NLD should start 2017 by scrapping the Myitsone dam",2017-01-03,"Opinion","The arguments against the Myitsone Dam project are pervasive and convincing. Decision-makers in Myanmar should scrap the project as their first action in 2017.           The beginning of the year is always a time of prediction and thus peak season for pundits. Twelve months ago, many pundits on Myanmar predicted the National League for Democracy-led government would, once it assumed power, quickly scrap the controversial Myitsone dam project.Three reasons were provided for this prediction.First, the NLD-backed government would not dare to resume a project that would stand at the headwater of the Ayeyarwady River, widely recognised as Myanmar’s cultural birthplace and lifeline.Second, the NLD government would not dare to resume a project that would mainly power China (in exchange for a mere US$17 billion paid over 50 years), while half the people in Myanmar still lack access to electricity.Third, the NLD government would not dare to resume a project that had emerged as the major symbol of Myanmar’s political change, as hard evidence that the government had finally started listening to its people.Pundits were even more certain that the project would be scrapped when fighting flared up again in August and September last year in Kachin State (the Myitsone dam site is located only 37 kilometres away from Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State). After all, it is common sense that major infrastructure must not be pursued in an area of civil violence.An estimated 85 percent of people in Myanmar oppose the Myitsone dam, according to a recent poll by the Yangon School of Political Science (YSPS). Indeed, we cannot think of a single infrastructure project worldwide which faces a more sweeping opposition.Nevertheless, the Myitsone project is still in limbo and it does not look as if any final decision will be undertaken soon. President U Htin Kyaw formed a commission in August 2016 to evaluate all proposed hydropower projects on the Ayeyarwady River. An initial assessment report was submitted in November, but more analyses are allegedly needed for definitive recommendations.Those who defend the project frequently point out that any contract signed must be served. Yet contracts can be terminated prematurely. China Power Investment Corporation (CPIC), the main dam developer, claims to have spent 800 million on the project already. Decision-makers in Myanmar could scrutinise this claim and then reimburse CPIC for the costs that have already occurred.Admittedly, this reimbursement would be costly – roughly 5pc of the government’s’ annual budget. However, it is also possible that the government would be able to negotiate a reduced settlement since CPIC is keen not to attract any more negative attention to itself via the project.Those who defend the project also frequently argue that a cancellation of the Myitsone dam would make it impossible to construct any further dams in Myanmar. This is plainly false. A decision on the Myitsone dam is not a decision on Myanmar’s future energy mix. Indeed, many activists we interviewed explained that while they specifically oppose the Myitsone project, they are not against hydropower dams per se.For instance, we interviewed multiple activists in Kachin State and several argued that dam projects upstream of the Myitsone could be carried out, with the proper reviews and consultations. CPIC is already the main developer for these projects and could continue to take a central role in them. Those worried that Chinese developers may violate various international environmental and social safeguards could be conciliated if CPIC is teamed up with reputable developers from Europe or the Americas.Less than a year into its term, the NLD-backed government is facing increasing criticism from its constituents. Some wonder if the government is really putting the interests of the people of Myanmar first. Some even question whether the NLD is doing business any differently than its predecessor. Cancelling the Myitsone dam would constructively respond to this mounting criticism and possibly provide new momentum and goodwill for the government.Most importantly, at a time when the prospects for peace and national reconciliation look bleaker than they have in years, the announcement to officially axe the Myitsone dam could help to get the all-important peace process back on track. The Shan State legislature has recently labelled the Northern Alliance-Burma, a coalition of the Kachin and their allies, as a “terrorist” organisation. The scrapping of the Myitsone dam – demanded by the Kachin first and for almost a decade now – would give particular recognition to their grievances and would thus help to rebuild bridges burnt via this antagonistic labelling.The arguments against the Myitsone project remain pervasive and convincing. It is long past time for decision-makers in Myanmar to cancel the project. It will be financially costly, but the momentum and goodwill gathered via its cancellation will be more valuable. The NDL-led government would start this year on the right track if it cancelled the Myitsone dam as its first major action in 2017.Julian Kirchherr is an assistant professor for Sustainable Business and Innovation Studies at Utrecht University.

"129",129,"KNU-backed development projects in Tanintharyi on hold",2016-12-23,"National News","A major economic project backed by the Karen National Union has been stalled until after the government greenlights a Tanintharyi industrial zone.          A company controlled by the KNU took over the development scheme, which has been criticised by local activist groups, after foreign investors fell by the wayside, The Myanmar Times has found.On December 13, two Myanmar companies, Noble Prince and Sun and Rainbow, signed an agreement with the Power China International Group for the development of the Mae Tha Mee Khee Industrial Estate Project, the Tanintharyi Renewable Energy Power Project for dam construction on the Tanintharyi River and other related works, including the construction of a small port and the building of a road linking Htee Kee and Ka Net Thi Ri in Tanintharyi Region.The next day, a coalition of 17 local organisations criticised the development, including the KNU’s involvement, for the secrecy which surrounded it.Noble Prince, a fully KNU-owned company, will own the projects, while the private company Sun and Rainbow has been assigned to operate and invite investors, according to U Ye Myint, director of Sun and Rainbow.Speaking on December 19, Sun and Rainbow managing director U Ngwe Soe said the KNU-backed company and its partner had decided to step in after a well-known Thai industrial real estate company started to cool on the project in the face of its practical difficulties. The need for upgrades on the road between the SEZ and Mae Tha Mee Khee Industrial Estate, and the dubious outlook of this possibility, led them to pull out, according to U Ngwe Soe, who is also the economic adviser of Myeik-Dawei District KNU. The Thai company did not return repeated requests for comment.“Except the [Dawei] industrial zone and industrial estate, the projects related to energy, ports and road construction are just in the conceptual stage, which is the pre-requisite for developing industrial zones,” he said. “We have been waiting for a long time for the government procedures for implementing Mae Tha Mee Khee industrial zone and estate project – despite the fact we got the permission from the previous government in February 2015.”“The industrial zone and estate project is the one the government itself is supporting to promote regional development and create jobs to attract overseas migrant workers to come back home. The projects the CSOs are objecting to are just at the conceptual stage at the moment. We have no permission from the government, and there is no feasibility study yet,” he said, adding that the KNU had never undertaken a project without government permission.“The KNU formed Noble Prince, and all the negotiations are being handled by the KNU,” he said.U Ngwe Soe also defended the Chinese partner, Power China, a state-owned enterprise which he said had a good record of corporate social responsibility and business ethics.“We invited Thai, Japanese and local investors as well to implement the projects. But only Power China was interested at the stage of signing the MoU. But we still hope other companies will come forward to handle the logistics, power supply, construction services and urban planning, industrial estate operation and management and development,” he said.For all projects, Power China will be fully financed and the likely investment will be in the millions of US dollars, he said, with profit-sharing arrangements yet to be decided and submitted to the Myanmar Investment Commission.“We signed a Memorandum of Understanding in front of regional government officials because we would like to give a message that, after the ceasefire agreement, ethnic armed groups like the KNU can operate such a big industrial zone with the support of government – when the government thinks that KNU is complying with the rules and regulations,” he said.Citing remarks by State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to the effect that the peace process and economic development must proceed hand in hand, U Ngwe Soe said, “People complain that KNU is getting involved in businesses while still maintaining arms. The KNU will lay down its arms later, and formed Noble Prince in preparation for future economic activities.”","/national-news/24356-knu-backed-development-projects-in-tanintharyi-on-hold.html"
"130",130,"CSOs call for greater transparency in Tanintharyi developments",2016-12-16,"National News","A coalition of local residents has criticised two Myanmar companies and a Chinese firm for announcing plans for a number of development projects in Tanintharyi Region. In a statement issued on December 14, the residents also attacked the local ethnic armed group, the Karen National Union, for its apparent participation in the projects.          On December 13, the two Myanmar companies, Noble Prince and Sun and Rainbow, signed an agreement with the Power China International Group for the development of the Mae Tha Mee Khee Industrial Estate Project, the Tanintharyi Renewable Energy Power Project for dam construction on the Tanintharyi River and other related works, including the construction of a small port and the building of a road linking Htee Kee and Ka Net Thi Ri in Tanintharyi Region.The next day, 17 civil society organisations in the region issued a statement saying the projects must not proceed without transparency and accountability.The CSO coalition says no information has been provided to the public about these projects, and no consultation has taken place with local Karen communities or civil society groups. “This represents a severe lack of transparency and a violation of international human rights principles,” says the statement.Local residents are particularly concerned about the involvement of the Karen National Union, which claims to represent the interests of the Kayin ethnic group. The KNU seal was on the invitation letter for the MoU signing ceremony in Dawei, which KNU chair General Mutu Say Poe attended. The precise extent of KNU involvement is unclear, however.Local Karen communities say the negative impacts of other projects in the KNU-controlled Myeik-Dawei District, such as the Myanmar Stark Prestige Plantation (MSPP) palm-oil project and the Ban Chaung coal mine, have not yet been resolved. They have appealed to the KNU not to proceed with more business interests that they say harm the environment and human rights.“We are greatly disappointed that the KNU chair rushed to attend the signing ceremony, and we do not accept the MoU signed for these projects because the signing is against the will of Karen people,” said the statement.The statement goes on to say that investment in large-scale infrastructure projects must not come before sustainable peace is achieved and political dialogue commences. The signatory organisations want a public consultation process with civil society, and the free, prior and informed consent of local communities.Naw Pe Tha Law, consultant at Tarkapaw Youth Group, told The Myanmar Times that the main reason for disappointment was the lack of transparency and the failure to consult with local residents.“We’re hearing of an industrial estate to be built on 6000 acres [2400 hectares] of land in Htee Kee, and a hydropower project that will produce up to 600 megawatts and a 70-mile road to be built to Htee Kee. I think they should proceed only after getting comments from the community and regional organisations and CSOs,” she said.Phado Mann Nyein Maung, a KNU central executive committee member, said he was aware that MOUs had been signed for some projects but did not know details. Repeated attempts by The Myanmar Times to contact any of the companies involved were unsuccessful.According to U Ho Pin, Tanintharyi Region minister of civil development, the projects are still in early phases.“As far as I understand, we had a rough agreement between the KNU and the regional government arranged in last two month about the industrial estate project in Htee Khee to create job opportunities and raise the living standards of an area where mostly ethnic Kayin people live,” he said. “But the related projects are just proposals to the regional government. We have not permitted or recommended those projects ... All the big projects can only be undertaken at the Union government’s behest.”He added that projects that were disputed by the local population would not be easily greenlit by the current administration.“The Tanintharyi cabinet will not accept or give a positive recommendation for any projects which the local community is against. We would never change the attitude of what we stood for as the opposition party. That attitude [of standing for the people] is not different now that we have become the government,” he said, while also asking for patience in regard to the review of projects that were agreed to by the previous administration.","/national-news/24247-csos-call-for-greater-transparency-in-tanintharyi-developments.html"

Five members set off for China on November 28 for a 10-day visit, said party secretary U Tun Aung Kyaw. State hluttaw MP U Kyaw Zaw Oo (Independent; Sittwe 2), the party’s former secretary, and Amyotha Hluttaw MP U Kyaw Than (ANP; Rakhine 10) are also taking part.

It sees Rakhine State as an important gateway into Myanmar and seeks better relations with the main ethnic party in the state.“China has many investments in Rakhine State, but they are unpopular with most residents.

"132",132,"For Najib, too much is never enough",2016-12-01,"Opinion","Earlier this week, there was a repeat showing on television of the 2002 movie About a Boy, in which there is a brief reference to The Moustache Brothers in Mandalay.           Like many comedians, the brothers used satire to poke fun at figures in authority, which in those days meant Myanmar’s ruling generals.In most societies, government leaders are reasonably well-grounded and able to take a joke and laugh along with the audience.Not Myanmar’s dictators back then; they put two of The Moustache Brothers in jail for several years.For, although they strutted and postured with their medals and guns, the generals were weak men, so devoid of backbone they could be reduced to jelly by a simple joke.Today, there are others in the region who are equally thin-skinned and spineless. One is Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak.On November 26, his forces detained the cartoonist Zulkifli Anwar Ulhaque, known as Zunar, and accused him of making nuclear bombs and having sex with orangutans.No, sorry, it was for something far more absurd: he was charged with sedition, in other words conspiring to bring down the state – oh, and he will also be investigated for “intentionally humiliating a person.”That person is Najib: the poor little rich-boy prime minister, whose officials had earlier arrested Maria Chin Abdullah, a human rights activist and leader of the Bersih (“Clean”) movement for free and fair elections.Both Chin and Zunar have now been released, but the PM’s actions reiterated that no strong criticism, and certainly no jokes or cartoons, about him or his policies, will be tolerated.Najib knows that satiric jibes, particularly about his wealth and his avaricious wife, if allowed free rein, will erode his support in his own party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).That is why, when there is so much chatter about the cabinet choices of America’s president-elect Donald Trump, it is worth looking at their Malaysian counterparts, for they are the men who keep Najib in power.Astonishingly, Najib’s cabinet has 35 members. In contrast, Trump’s is likely to be less than half that size.Many of Najib’s ministers were chosen for fidelity, not competence. They provide verbal and logistical support and ensure the allegiance of the party’s constituency heads across the country.The really pivotal men - and they are all men, all Malay and all Muslim - helm key ministries and have top posts in UMNO, the latter being more critical than their ministerial positions.Thus, Home Minister and Deputy PM Zahid Hamidi, and Defence Minister Hishammuddin “Hisham” Hussein, who are No. 2 and 3 in the party after Najib, are the PM’s most important lieutenants. If they defect, Najib would be left in a very tricky position. He has already lost one DPM, Muhyiddin Yassin, who split over a scandal involving huge losses at the state investment fund 1MDB, which Najib headed.However, it is unlikely to happen again, since Zahid and Hisham have become clones of their boss, emulating his lack of any guiding philosophy aside from survival and self-aggrandisement.Admittedly all three are savvy strategists, generous networkers and fervent Malay nationalists, but they have also often proved to be fickle turncoats, devoid of shame and deeply materialistic.Their wealth and property acquisitions, notably of Najib and his wife Rosmah, are the stuff of legends. The expression “too much ain’t enough” could have been coined for them.Zahid and Hisham have not quite reached the PM’s level of richness and notoriety, but they are getting there.That said, two other traits may derail all three. The first is their intolerance of criticism, whether jokey or not. And the other is their questionable adherence to Islamic values, which in Malaysia can be fatal.Indeed, it is routine for UMNO politicians to accuse opposition Malays of being unIslamic because they allegedly cooperate too much with the Chinese and Indian communities and absorb their values.Thus, they are often alleged to be womanisers or to drink alcohol or eat pork – all forbidden under Islam; yet such threats are rarely made against ruling party leaders.If ever they are made, the indiscretions of UMNO men are invariably buried within the inside pages of the state-controlled media or simply ignored. However, in recent times, given the scale of the scandals that have plagued the Najib years, from murder accusations to multi-billion dollar corruption cases, it has become impossible to keep them hidden.And they have generated an impression of the pot calling the kettle black when Najib’s men try to accuse the opposition of being unIslamic.As those who attend private dinners and parties hosted by UMNO leaders know full well, the booze flows freely and the chicks, while not free, are plentiful and certainly don’t wear headscarves. If he and his men are not careful, it is this decadent, “rich and famous” lifestyle that may not only provide fodder for the cartoonists, but may bring down Najib and his team and usher in younger, cleaner leaders.Of course, Najib’s cabinet acolytes, as well as his legions of division heads and senior figures in the judiciary, national bank, police and intelligence services, will seek to ensure this does not happen.All are beholden to him through a vast patronage network, which is why, although he may appear to have too much lucre for any mortal man to comprehend, it is never enough.Meanwhile, if anyone – opposition MP or journalist, human rights activist or comedian – dares to say otherwise and humiliate Najib, they had better prepare to be smacked down. Very very harshly.","/opinion/24001-for-najib-too-much-is-never-enough.html"
"133",133,"China, Myanmar meet as fighting continues in Shan State",2016-11-30,"National News","China has stepped up its engagement with Myanmar’s peace process amid ongoing clashes near the country’s shared border in Shan State, having twice held senior-level meetings with negotiators over the past week.           A nine-member delegation from Myanmar is meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in China this week, an adviser to the Myanmar Peace Commission confirmed yesterday. The delegation, led by peace commission chair U Tin Myo Win, was invited on the November 26 to December 2 trip by Beijing. Lieutenant General Yar Pyae, the head of the Tatmadaw’s No 2 Bureau of Special Operations, responsible for four commands in Shan State, and Brigadier-General Than Hlaing are also among the delegates.The envoys’ upcoming China visit comes in the wake of a joint November 20 attack by a coalition of ethnic armed groups against the Tatmadaw along a trade corridor in Muse and Kutkai townships, northern Shan State.Ongoing fighting has had direct consequences for China. Thousands of Myanmar civilians have poured over the border seeking refuge, while stray munitions have also crossed the divide. China has responded by cautioning all groups to exercise “restraint” and urged them back to the negotiating table, while also ramping up its own security presence along the Yunnan province side of the border.One of the main parties involved in the fighting, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), has direct ties to China. The ethnically Chinese force is led by Pheung Kyar-shin, an 85-year-old warlord who was ousted from the region in a Tatmadaw offensive in 2009 and is reported to have spent some of the last six years in China regrouping his forces. China has previously denied providing support to the MNDAA.When fighting between the Tatma­daw and the MNDAA escalated in February 2015, relations with Beijing and Nay Pyi Taw took a frosty turn, with Myanmar state media accusing China of harbouring rebels and allies, and providing treatment in Chinese hospitals.During the more recent conflict, China appears to have assumed a mediating role, sending a Chinese delegation comprised of military and foreign affairs officials to Nay Pyi Taw at the same time as the Myanmar envoy travelled to China.“From China’s point of view, actively engaging and helping facilitate [the peace process] can help to secure the border,” Chao Chung-chi, an assistant professor of Southeast Asian studies at National Chinan University, told VOA on November 23.Following the November 26 meeting in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement saying the first so-called “2+2” meeting of defence and foreign ministry representatives from both China and Myanmar involved discussions on “matters of security and development along the borders of the two countries” and “the stability in Myanmar-China border areas, [as well as] China’s constructive support for the peace process of Myanmar”.After the 2+2 meeting, the Chinese delegation met with Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing about “China’s stance and actions regarding the ongoing incidents in the northeastern region”, the Tatmadaw-run Myawady newspaper reported.China has traditionally taken a more reticent, backseat approach toward Myanmar’s peace process, offering mostly abstract statements of support. The recent conflict near the border has prompted an outpouring of responses on social media, with many suggesting China take on a facilitating role. Chinese state media has echoed the sentiment.Last week, Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, ran two editorials that called on Beijing to take a “more active approach” in response to the Shan State offensive.The op-ed also said the instability and fighting between ethnic armed groups and the Tatmadaw along the border was disturbing the Chinese frontier, adding that China could take stronger measures to coordinate and mediate.None of the groups engaged in the ongoing fighting – the Kachin Independence Army, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), the MNDAA and the Arakan Army – have signed the nationwide ceasefire agreement.However, U Hla Maung Shwe, an adviser to the Myanmar Peace Commission, tried to downplay the significance of the Myanmar delegation’s China trip.“They are inviting a lot of people from Myanmar to China. This is one such kind of visit. They are only having general discussions about the situation along the Myanmar-China border,” he said yesterday.U Hla Muang Shwe added that the talks would also include the “situation” in northern Shan State.A separate November 24 Global Times article headlined “Only negotiations, not violence, can improve peace prospects in Myanmar”, which was translated into Myanmar language and posted on the Chinese embassy in Yangon’s official Facebook page, said the ongoing fighting is challenging “China’s sovereignty, security and strategic interests”.The article also said Myanmar’s ongoing armed conflicts are undermining China’s strategic interest in the country, including “the massive border trade and huge investment” and “security of pipelines and other large-scale investment projects in Myanmar”.“With its significant geopolitical location, Myanmar has a prominent status in China’s One Belt and One Road initiative and the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor. But these initiatives will have a shadow cast upon them by the fighting in Myanmar,” it said.","/national-news/23969-china-myanmar-meet-as-fighting-continues-in-shan-state.html"
"134",134,"China continues to court on Myitsone project ahead of commission presser",2016-11-18,"National News","As the commission tasked with reviewing hydropower projects along the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwady River submitted its first report to the president this past week, Chinese state media has assured its nation of the ongoing “friendly and cooperative” Sino-Myanmar relationship.           The China News article, entitled “China’s Mandalay Consul General: The Sino-Myanmar Sustained Friendship”, was published on November 15, just four days after the commission submitted its report to President U Htin Kyaw.The review commission is tipped to favour scrapping the controversial Chinese-backed Myitsone dam in Kachin State.Despite a Myanmar Green Network meeting held in Kachin State at the end of last month, where villagers, NGOs and government officials spoke out about the potential negative effects of the dam, the counsellor of the Chinese embassy in Myanmar maintained that mutual cooperation can resolve these challenges.“The Myitsone dam is just one instance of Sino-Myanmar cooperation. This does not represent the whole of the relationship,” Wang Zongying was quoted as saying in the Chinese-language media. “Those who bad-mouth the relationship are biased.”For China, the US$3.6 million dam, the largest slated for the Ayeyarwady River, is an attractive venture, but one that has required several years of political manoeuvring following its 2011 suspension.The dam would give China greater influence along the China-Myanmar border, an already contentious area. It would also generate 6000MW of electricity, mostly for export, in a country where 70 percent of the population does not have access to electricity.Speaking to Myanmar’s electricity deficit, Mr Wang said, “Myanmar has recognised this problem on its own and must make great efforts to resolve it. But because of limited funds and a shortage of qualified individuals, it is difficult to improve this in a short period of time.”“This is a field where the Chinese side can communicate and act cooperatively with Myanmar, whether it is by building public roads, railways, boats, et cetera,” he added.The former military government, Myanmar conglomerate Asia World and Chinese firm China Power Investment Corporation (CPI) formed a joint venture – Upstream Ayeyarwady Confluence Basin Hydropower Company – to build the Myitsone dam in 2006.Concerns about the dam’s environmental impacts, displacement of local populations and an original power-transfer agreement that would see about 90pc of the electricity generated by Myitsone sent to China have all fuelled persisting resistance to the project.Since the National League for Democracy took over the government, China has launched a charm offensive, lobbying hard to restart the stalled hydropower project.Whether or not the commission decides to move forward with the Myitsone dam, China will still play a huge role in developing the 2000-kilometre (1240-mile) shared border with Yunnan province, Chinese state media argued.The article details some of the 565 infrastructure projects including developing roads, aviation networks and internet connections as part of China’s “One Belt One Road” initiative, a global development strategy stretching from Southeast Asia to East Africa.But China is still anxious to hear word of the commission’s decision, one which will have an effect on the other geopolitical and economic aspects of the Sino-Myanmar relationship.The 20-member commission tasked with reviewing hydropower projects is expected to hold a press conference about its report in the coming week.“We will continue to communicate with the new NLD government,” Mr Wang said. “And at the same time communicate with people of Myanmar so we create a real impact in their lives.”","/national-news/23762-china-continues-to-court-on-myitsone-project-ahead-of-commission-presser.html"
"135",135,"Southeast Asia questions US ties after Trump win",2016-11-14,"Opinion","With his shocking victory in the US presidential election, Donald Trump has made history – and made a lot of people very afraid. In fact, his rise threatens to incite a revolution that shakes the foundations not only of American politics, but also of global peace and prosperity. One region that is likely to start feeling tremors soon is Southeast Asia.          Throughout his campaign, Trump espoused an “America first” worldview, emphasising that he would follow through on US international commitments only when it suits him. This has rattled many a US ally and partner, including the countries of Southeast Asia, which fear that they will be all but ignored by a key guarantor of stability in their neighbourhood.This would represent a notable reversal from the last eight years, during which President Barack Obama made a concerted effort to deepen America’s ties with Southeast Asia. Under Obama’s stewardship, the US acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, and joined the East Asia Summit.Moreover, in 2013, the US became the first ASEAN dialogue partner to establish a permanent mission to the organisation. Last year, the country forged a strategic partnership with ASEAN. And, earlier this year, Obama hosted the first US-ASEAN summit on American soil. Obama also brought four ASEAN members into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a mega-regional trade deal that would promote US economic exchange with the region.Obama also helped to cement bilateral ties with most countries in the region, visiting nine out of 10 during his two terms in office. Had a US government shutdown not forced him to cancel a trip to Brunei in 2013, he would have had a perfect record.To be sure, America’s ties with Thailand and the Philippines have deteriorated somewhat during Obama’s second term, owing to the US president’s criticism of violations of democratic norms and human rights in both countries. But that regression has been more than offset by progress in America’s relationships with Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore and especially Vietnam.Obama’s efforts in Southeast Asia were all part of his broader strategic “pivot” to Asia, announced in 2011. Aimed at helping the US to maintain its strategic primacy in the Asia-Pacific region, the policy has been quietly welcomed by most regional actors, as it dovetails with their desire to check China’s hegemonic ambitions in the region.All of this may be about to change. Trump is likely to focus overwhelmingly on domestic issues, at the expense of America’s strategic interests abroad. Indeed, he may well back away from strategic engagement with ASEAN and its members, causing their relationships with the US to deteriorate. If he fails to show up at important regional meetings like the East Asian Summits, that deterioration will become even more pronounced.Trump’s indifferent attitude will also hurt bilateral relations. To be sure, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines may prefer a US president who does not trouble himself to criticise their governments’ human-rights abuses, corruption or constitutional shenanigans. But US relations with other countries in the region may stall, if not deteriorate, as confidence in Trump’s willingness to follow through on US commitments collapses.Economic ties are also likely to suffer. Under Trump, who has revealed strong protectionist tendencies, the TPP will stay moribund, at best. The US-ASEAN Connect initiative, which Obama proposed at the summit earlier this year, and which aims to boost America’s economic engagement with the regional grouping, may also go nowhere.It is not only Southeast Asia that will suffer from Trump’s indifference. Australia, India, and Japan – key US allies and security partners in the Asia-Pacific region – may also find it difficult to connect with Trump, further undermining faith in the US-led regional security architecture. The strategic rebalancing toward Asia that Obama worked so hard to advance may be thrown into reverse, dealing a heavy blow to Asia and the US alike.One Asian country that may welcome the election’s outcome is China. Although Trump has criticised China extensively for supposedly stealing American jobs – and even blamed it for creating the “hoax” of climate change – he may take a softer stance on Chinese strategic expansionism in the region, especially in the South China Sea, than Obama did.In a far-fetched but not implausible scenario, Trump may even strike a deal with China over its territorial claims, disregarding the interests of US allies, from Japan to the Philippines. Such a move would be particularly devastating to perceptions of Trump’s America in Southeast Asia.The good news is that this outcome is not guaranteed. Campaign rhetoric is one thing; governing is quite another. Once in the White House, a heavily advised Trump may realise that maintaining some continuity in America’s foreign policy, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, is more in line with US interests than the alternative. If nothing else, Trump may resist the idea of China gaining strategic primacy in the region.For Trump, who made his career in real estate, perhaps the best way to look at it is in business terms. The US would be remiss to squander all the significant investment that his predecessor has made in Southeast Asia.– Project SyndicateLe Hong Hiep is a fellow at ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, Singapore, and author of the forthcoming book Living Next to the Giant: The Political Economy of Vietnam’s Relations With China Under Doi Moi.","/opinion/23649-southeast-asia-questions-us-ties-after-trump-win.html"
"136",136,"Government plans paddy purchases ",2016-11-11,"Business","The government has formed special working groups to organise state purchases of paddy amid a slump in market demand.           Vice President Henry Van Thio held a coordination meeting at the President’s Office on November 9 to discuss plans to purchase paddy directly from farmers. A Chinese crackdown on border imports has resulted in a surplus of rice and paddy that has pushed prices down. Heavy rainfall has made things worse, soaking harvests and lowering prices further.Myanmar’s Law of Protection of the Farmer Rights and Enhancement of their Benefits allows for the creation of an Agricultural Produce Management Body and a Price Purchasing Supervisory Working Group to organise the purchase of crops by the state.Both of these have been formed in order to help manage the situation, U Henry Van Thio said. The two groups will decide in which regions paddy purchases are required and organise the purchases after submitting the region list to the Leading Body, which is formed by the agriculture and commerce ministries, he added.Henry Van Thio said that warehouses and rice mills should be used as sales centres, but that there would also need to be a plan for transporting, storing, milling and distribution after the government buys the paddy.According to chapter 7 of the law, the Leading Body can apply for the required funds from the Union Government, which is able to allocate financing from Union revenue. The paddy can be bought by “suitable means” including a tender system, according to the law, but issue of how to purchase the paddy was not raised at the meeting.Purchasing rice in addition to paddy was also not discussed, although U Ye Tint, director general of the agricultural department, who attended the meeting, said that would be considered later. Agriculture associations have recommended using the National Rice Reserve Supervisory Committee to support rice prices in the past.U Ye Tint Tun also told The Myanmar Times that the issue of long-term price stability and infrastructure investment had come up during the discussion.“We discussed investing in paddy drying machines and building warehouses,” he said. Henry Van Thio said that paddy-drying facilities were important for the entire rice sector.U Maung Soe, a farmer from Nay Pyi Taw, said that farmers are face paddy wastage because of heavy raining saturating the crop during harvesting season and lowering the quality.“When it was raining during harvesting season, the amount of the wastage of paddy was high and farmers had to relocate paddy,” he said. “The worst situation is that relocating paddy increases labour costs.”Ko Nay Soe, a rice miller, said rain continues to cause issues.“It’s still raining so the humidity causes problems and rice millers and traders who store paddy dare not buy,” he said.The government has also announced plan to allow a temporary export of paddy, which is usually prohibited, in November only.Translation by Thiri Min Htun","/business/23628-government-plans-paddy-purchases.html"
"137",137,"Japan announces a nearly $8 billion package for Myanmar",2016-11-03,"National News","Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe yesterday announced nearly US$8 billion in aid, loans and investment to promote development and reconciliation in Myanmar after talks with its de facto leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.           The 800 billion yen ($7.7 billion) package from both the public and private sectors is to be spread over five years, Mr Abe said.“This is designed to help Myanmar’s nation-building through its balanced development,” Mr Abe told reporters in a joint appearance with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi after their talks.A total of 40 billion yen is earmarked to promote amity in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, which has been emerging from years of military dictatorship and ethnic conflict.“With this aid, it is our hope that the fruits of reconciliation will be spread across Myanmar and be further promoted,” Mr Abe said.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi repeatedly thanked Japan for helping her country.“Such assistance will help Myanmar build peace and develop itself,” said Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who arrived in Tokyo on November 1 for a five-day visit.The state counsellor and foreign minister has pursued whirlwind diplomacy since her party took power six months ago, including visits to Southeast Asian neighbours as well as key allies China, the United States and India.Her travels are aimed at attracting economic development and infrastructure aid to rebuild the resource-rich country after decades of military rule, economic isolation and civil conflict.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s five-day trip to Japan is but the latest move in a relationship that can benefit both countries as their relationship continues to deepen, analysts say.While in Japan, the state counsellor is expected to discuss development projects and the peace process, including the conflict ravaging northern Rakhine State, which has been subjected to a media blackout within Myanmar.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi did not touch on the military operations in northern Rakhine State during the press conference, but a Japanese official briefing reporters on her talks with Mr Abe paraphrased her as saying Myanmar would deal with the problem under the law.Though the state counsellor has already visited China, the United States and India since taking power following elections a year ago, neither Japanese nor Myanmar sources have commented on suggestions that an earlier visit would have better reflected the importance of Japan to Myanmar’s economic development.Analysts have generally welcomed the visit, citing the differences between Japanese and Chinese investments in Myanmar. Japan is not seen as an exploiter, and tends to invest in large-scale manufacturing and infrastructure rather than extractive industries.Political and economic analyst U Than Soe said Japan had a good record in investing in Asia, and offered Myanmar significant opportunities that Nay Pyi Taw should be prepared to seize.“Myanmar has a large workforce and plenty of land. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi should invite investments from Japan during her visit,” he said.In order to create a more welcoming environment for such investment, Myanmar would be expected to strengthen its national institutions and legislative frameworks, improve its infrastructure, resolve land ownership disputes equitably and, perhaps most important, restore peace to the country as a whole.The recent decision of US President Barack Obama to lift US sanctions has also highlighted the need for Myanmar to reinforce its banking and financial sector. Long-term international loans should be used to create a more competitive infrastructure, in terms of roads, bridges, water and electricity, says U Than Soe.The Myanmar Investment Commission has already approved 88 direct investments from Japan worth a total of US$674.227 million. Of these, 77, worth $571.532 million, are already in operation. A further 19 Japanese businesses have invested indirectly via other countries, to the extent of $983.483 million.Additionally, there are 24 investments in Thilawa special economic zone that do not fall under MIC jurisdiction, worth $251.25 million, and further inputs are expected in the case of Dawei SEZ, in which Japan also has a significant interest.“Japan operates Dawei port,” said Daw Aye Aye Win, a director general in the Ministry of Industry. “We’ve paid compensation for land and created job opportunities there. We look forward to further improvements across the country.”Japan has upgraded railway lines, water supply networks and other infrastructure in Myanmar, supported the improvement of laws and policies in industry, improved human resources through training programs and provided loans for small- and medium-sized businesses.The Japan International Cooperation Agency also drew up the Master Plan for the country’s development in 2011, when it began to offer Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Myanmar. According to the SME development department, Japan will lend K5 billion at 0.01 percent interest, of which Myanmar has already received K3.5 billion, with the rest to come next year. SMEs are at the heart of the Myanmar economy, said Daw Aye Aye Win.“As our country continues to develop its industrial sector, links with Japan can only strengthen. Now there is a gap, and we must continue to improve our small and medium enterprises,” she said.Most of the factories in Myanmar are Japanese-owned, and located in Thilawa port.U Maung Maung Lay, of the Merchants and Industrial Entrepreneurs Association, said Japan had greatly assisted Myanmar with loans.According to the Ministry of Commerce, Japan-Myanmar trading amounted to $800 million in the 2011-12 fiscal year, rising to a high of $2305 million in 2014-15. Last year, it fell to $1845, spurring fears of a further reduction this year.Finance Minister U Kyaw Win is set to lead a group of 32 entrepreneurs in banking, construction and other fields to discuss the situation with their Japanese counterparts during the Tokyo visit.Translation by Win Thaw Tar and Khine Thazin Han","/national-news/23451-japan-announces-a-nearly-8-billion-package-for-myanmar.html"
"138",138,"Washington’s untapped influence",2016-10-31,"Opinion","On October 7, US President Barack Obama signed an executive order lifting nearly all of the remaining economic sanctions on Myanmar, following a meeting with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi during her September trip to Washington. American businesses are eager to invest in “the last frontier” in Asia, fearing that China has already dominated economic opportunities there.           Despite China’s enduring influence over its neighbour, the United States enjoys several unrecognised – and underutilised – advantages over the Asian giant, flowing from its substantial soft power, an asset China has failed to cultivate.Myanmar watchers often frame the country’s democratic opening as Nay Pyi Taw’s attempt to balance the influence of Chinese and Western powers. Many credit the political transition to the former junta leaders’ desire to pivot away from Beijing’s long-time dominance by leveraging US support for systemic reforms.With the Obama administration’s easing of sanctions on the country, some now suggest that the US and China are locked in a competition for influence in Myanmar, which finds itself at an historic crossroads. Were it that simple, Myanmar would have been “lost” to China many years ago, given Beijing’s proximity, power and history.However, Myanmar is a country, not a prize, and as events such as Brexit recently illustrated, nationalist impulses nearly always trump more rational, economic motives. Despite the relative absence of US investment in the country, Myanmar’s people still look to the West as a force for good.Yet, as Monish Tourangbam and Pawan Amin note in a recent article at Policy Forum, China still enjoys a strategic advantage. Given years of Chinese economic clout and Myanmar’s chronic underdevelopment, this situation likely won’t change for some time. As Myanmar scholar Bertil Lintner said in a recent interview, “Myanmar remains of huge economic and strategic importance for China.”China is Myanmar’s largest trade partner, with bilateral exchange in goods reaching nearly US$10 billion in the first 10 months of 2015-16. Seeking to escape that trade imbalance, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s government has courted the United States and most recently made the case that the time was right for lifting sanctions. The Obama administration and the US Congress continue to advocate for Myanmar’s democratic progress as they seek to deepen cooperation with the country.But as Lintner argues, “Nice words about enduring friendship and progress in implementing democracy and respect for human rights may have been said during [Daw Aung San] Suu Kyi’s visit to Washington. But realities on the ground will not change. China is there, just across the northeastern border. And the US, despite its ‘pivot’, is far away.”Myanmar’s massive economic needs ensure that Western investment alone cannot fill the void. However, the United States possesses a few key – and underappreciated – advantages that China should envy: a hugely positive reputation (compared to that of China); values of democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights, on which that positive perception rests; and unique and desirable business brands – these include globally recognised products such as Apple’s iPhone and Pepsi soda – which pose opportunities for inroads in Myanmar’s rapidly growing market. When asked, Myanmar people voice a clear preference for democracy, the English language, Western culture and business standards.Despite its massive economic leverage in the country, China suffers from a reputational trust deficit. Chinese projects such as the Myitsone dam have left a negative perception of the country’s investment strategy, with its lack of consideration for labour standards, the environment and human rights.Where Chinese businesses have rushed to secure investment deals, often displacing local people and wreaking havoc on the environment, American corporations have committed hefty sums of capital to invest in education, job training, health and water infrastructure, earning goodwill from the Myanmar people.However, US companies have been extremely reticent to commit to the country in the near term, wary of political risk and fearful of getting involved with “cronies” sanctioned by the US Treasury Department. The Obama administration hopes the recent move to ease restrictions will boost investment.The United States, viewed as a responsible business partner and staunch supporter of Myanmar’s democracy, wields enormous influence over the country’s leaders and people.While China will continue to hold an outsize presence in the country with its massive infrastructure investment, the United States has an untapped reservoir of goodwill. Myanmar businesses and consumers are eager for expanded US trade and investment in the country. The recent lifting of remaining sanctions will pave the way for expanded economic cooperation.At the same time, Washington should continue to press Myanmar’s leaders on democracy and human rights. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi values US opinion and has a strong relationship with President Barack Obama, his likely successor Hillary Clinton and the American Congress.When Mr Obama first visited the country in 2012 – he again visited in 2014 – he received a massive show of support, passing by tens of thousands of cheering people in the streets of Yangon. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton was also instrumental in US-Myanmar policy, travelling to the country in 2011 and spearheading Washington’s rapprochement with Nay Pyi Taw as part of the US “pivot” to Asia.In the long run, the US can explore further military-to-military engagement with Myanmar’s military under its International Military Education and Training (IMET) program. The US trained Myanmar military officers in the United States in the 1980s. Resuming US-Myanmar military engagement is a surefire way to build links with the latter’s most powerful institution.As the US and China compete for influence in Myanmar, it is important to recall that the “great game” may not have a clear winner. But there are a variety of instruments available for Washington to take advantage of the massive support it enjoys in the country.– New MandalaHunter Marston is an independent Myanmar analysis based in Washington, DC.

"139",139,"Hydropower commission tipped to advise nixing Myitsone: members",2016-10-28,"National News","Fifteen days until it must submit an initial report on whether several hydropower dams along the Ayeyarwady River should go forward, the commission for reviewing and scrutinising those projects is leaning toward recommending the most controversial of the bunch, the Myitsone mega-dam, be scrapped.           In mid-September, the 20-member commission visited the Myitsone dam site in Kachin State and met with residents living in the project area, amid growing local objections to a resumption of construction on the US$3.6 billion venture.A commission member who spoke on condition of anonymity said yesterday that the advisory body has begun compiling statistics for its first report and would advise the government not to continue the Myitsone project due to the public’s preponderate objections.“People don’t want to continue the project and we note that the Myitsone project was begun under the dictatorship,” said the member.Another commissioner who also asked for anonymity said the commission had not yet made a final decision on what recommendation it would deliver to the government on Myitsone, but that the consensus among its members was against going forward with the project.“We have no authorisation to talk to the media about the commission’s decision,” said the commissioner.The commission has been tasked with reviewing hydropower projects slated for the Ayeyarwady River and recommending whether they should continue, weighing costs and benefits to citizens along with the potential effects its recommendations could have on investors.Formed in August, the commission must submit its initial report to the president by November 11.There were conflicting accounts as to whether the report would be made public, as well as to whom that decision fell.U Zaw Htay, deputy director general for the President’s Office, said it would be up to the commission.“It depends only on the commission’s decision. It is independent of the government,” he said.But the commissioners said the commission would not release any information about its first report without the blessing of the government that formed it.Yesterday, residents of Ingyanyan township in Kachin State addressed an open letter to President U Htin Kyaw, demanding that he cancel seven hydropower projects slated for the Ayeyarwady River, including Myitsone.U Brang Shawng, a member of the Mungchying Rawt Jat organisation in Kachin State and a long-time opponent of the Myitsone project, told The Myanmar Times yesterday that the government should not continue to implement any hydropower projects opposed by the people.“We hope that the president will suspend these projects,” said U Brang Shawng, who is from Kachin State’s Chipwe township.The letter signatories’ objection to the hydropower dams stems from the manner in which the previous military government and investors had handled the projects – with no consideration for the opinions of the public and without transparency, the letter says.The former military government, the Myanmar conglomerate Asia World and Chinese firm China Power Investment Corporation (CPI) formed a joint venture – Upstream Ayeyarwady Confluence Basin Hydropower Company – to build the 4600-megawatt Myitsone dam in 2006.Development at the site was suspended in 2011 by then-president U Thein Sein, who cited a growing movement against it among the public.Concerns about the dam’s environmental impacts, displacement of local populations and an original power-transfer agreement that would see about 90 percent of the electricity generated by Myitsone sent to China have all fuelled persisting resistance to the project.Attempts by The Myanmar Times to reach CPI for comment yesterday were unsuccessful.","/national-news/23371-hydropower-commission-tipped-to-advise-nixing-myitsone-members.html"
"140",140,"Sliding into the Red Dragon’s embrace",2016-10-20,"Opinion","The best advice parents can give their children is simple: Forget English, start learning Chinese.           It is not a frivolous observation, for the influence of America and Europe has undeniably waned, while China has stepped into the breach and established itself as Southeast Asia’s dominant power.Consequently, governments from Bangkok to Manila and from Phnom Penh to Nay Pyi Taw are tripping over themselves to curry favour with Beijing.It remains to be seen, however, how much their people will agree to be drawn into this Sino-centric whirlpool, and what, if anything, they can do if they don’t like it.There have certainly been expressions of profound unease. Recently, a Bangkok Post article noted that Thailand has become so subservient to Beijing that it has sacrificed its reputation as a balanced regional leader.Startlingly, the article observed that people around the world were asking, “When did Thailand become a political colony of China?”Actually, the question could be asked of most of the members of ASEAN, especially of the so-called CLMV countries – Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.All of that quartet, to a greater or lesser extent, appear to have become, or are in the process of becoming, de facto colonies of China.But first, let’s look at how the military regime in Bangkok is perceived as having become so servile to Beijing that even its own people find it existentially threatening.They point to the case of Joshua Wong, a young Hong Kong activist, who was invited this month to an event marking the 40th anniversary of a massacre of students by the troops of an earlier military junta.At Beijing’s request, Wong was detained on arrival, subjected to the kind of treatment normally reserved for hardcore terrorists, and then put on a plane back to Hong Kong.That he had no criminal record and was legally entitled to enter Thailand made no difference – when a nation is at the beck and call of Beijing, legalities do not matter.Likewise, when Cambodia and Malaysia, like Thailand, were told to return Uighur refugees who face mistreatment back home, they were promptly flown to China, shackled and hooded, like Guantanamo detainees.And when Western nations condemn such inhumanity, it only plays into Beijing’s hands, for it never criticises countries in this region, but instead buys their fealty with investments and aid money.That is what has recently driven the Philippines, a treaty ally of the United States, into the surprised but immensely welcoming embrace of China.The new Philippine leader, President Rodrigo Duterte, has vowed to expel US troops, accused the Americans of trying to assassinate him, and rained obscenities upon US President Barack Obama.Concurrently, he has made it clear that he’s ready to get into bed with the Chinese and is eager to cut a deal to settle their sovereignty dispute in the South China Sea.So, just three months after a United Nations tribunal ruled in favour of Manila, the Chinese find their erstwhile adversary not only grovelling at their feet, but berating their strategic rival, the United States.Reflecting, admittedly more bluntly, the new Sino-centric tilt of other ASEAN nations, Duterte said this month, “I will be reconfiguring my foreign policy. I will break up with America.”Naturally, Manila’s relations with Beijing have grown ever cosier and Chinese officials happily coo that they “can now talk like Asians across the table with Asians”.Officially, Washington has rightly said little about all this, preferring to wait for Duterte’s wacky policies, including this bizarre shelving of a historically tried and tested relationship, to cause his downfall.Others have been less reticent. Admiral Dennis Blair, a former head of the US Pacific Command, said it is nonsensical for Manila to abandon an alliance with Washington in favour of closer ties with China.Said Blair, “Such a strategy is more dangerous than clever and risks jeopardising Philippine sovereignty by antagonising the United States and losing territory to China.”The same could be said for all the CLMV countries, which are in danger of becoming irrevocably and, it seems, willingly enmeshed in Beijing’s tentacles.That was evident when the new leaders of Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam chose to make their first foreign visit to Beijing – for no other reason than that they know who is the region’s boss these days.President Bounnhang Vorachit of Laos went in May, Myanmar’s Daw Aung San Suu Kyi followed suit in August and Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc scampered there last month.All paid tribute to the new emperor, promised to fall in line at ASEAN meetings and agreed not to cause a fuss over China’s aggressive policies and militarisation of islands it has usurped in the South China Sea.China’s President Xi Jinping purred like a cat lapping up cream when he told Vietnam’s obeisant Phuc that their nations’ mutual interests “far outweigh the differences”.Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he? It’s what he says to all ASEAN leaders as he plies them with trade and investment incentives – and, without expressly saying so, demands fidelity. And gets it.As he does, for instance, from Cambodia, which, along with Laos, and the complicity of Myanmar and Thailand, routinely forces ASEAN to retract any statements about the South China Sea that Beijing dislikes.Since China is the region’s biggest trading partner and largest provider of foreign aid, this situation is only going to become more and more pronounced. And there will be no comeback for Uncle Sam.So send your kids up north to Mandalay and beyond to practise those Mandarin tones. After all, if you can’t beat them, better join them.","/opinion/23198-sliding-into-the-red-dragon-s-embrace.html"
"141",141,"State counsellor meets Indian PM, other leaders at India forums",2016-10-19,"National News","State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi returns to Yangon today after a three-day trip to India, where she attended meetings of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and the economic grouping of five nations known as BRICS.           According to the State Counsellor’s Office website, the BRICS and BIMSTEC leaders’ Outreach Summit was the first-ever meeting of its kind. BRICS is an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, a grouping of five large and emerging national economies that was formed in 2009 as BRIC, with South Africa joining one year later.BIMSTEC, meanwhile, was founded as BIST-EC, consisting of Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand, in June 1997, with Myanmar joining later that year and Bhutan and Nepal also gaining membership in 2004. The seven nations – with a total population of 1.5 billion – formed BIMSTEC to “create an enabling environment for rapid economic development through identification and implementation of specific cooperation projects in the sectors of trade, investment and industry, technology, human recourse development, tourism, agriculture, energy, and infrastructure and transportation”, according to its website.In addition to the region forums, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi travelled to India at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, her first trip to the neighbouring nation since her government took power earlier this year.“Officially, she went to India to attend the BIMSTEC and BRICS meetings. But this is also her first trip to India as a state visit for [promoting] the bilateral friendship,” said Daw Aye Aye Soe, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry.The state counsellor, who also serves as foreign minister, was received by an honour guard yesterday in New Delhi at Rashtrapati Bhavan, the presidential residence, where she met with Mr Modi and Indian President Pranab Mukherjee.The state counsellor met with Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena as well, in the Indian coastal state of Goa on October 16, when opportunities for bilateral cooperation were discussed, according to the State Counsellor’s Office website.This week also offered Daw Aung San Suu Kyi another opportunity to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose country was the first major power the state counsellor visited since she assumed power. According to state media, the two leaders discussed advancing agreements made on her August trip to China, as well as security along the two countries’ shared border and recent upheaval in northern Rakhine State, where an armed assault on border guard posts and an ongoing manhunt for the militants is proving a major early challenge to her government.“In answer to the clarification of the peace process and the latest events in the northern part of Rakhine State by the State Counsellor, President Xi replied that he was well convinced of the matters and would provide constructive help,” the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar reported of their October 17 meeting.The report made no mention of the Chinese-backed Myitsone mega-dam, a project in Kachin State that remains suspended and the fate of which could set the tone for bilateral relations with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi at the helm.Though Myanmar shares a border – and cultural and historical links –with both India and China, geopolitical analysts have long noted Beijing’s far more extensive economic ties to the Southeast Asian nation. Pledges by New Delhi in recent years to “look east” in a concerted push to deepen engagement with fast-growing Southeast Asia have at times been criticised as more talk than action.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as the country’s de facto leader chose first to travel to Beijing, but she dispatched President U Htin Kyaw to India that same month.The state counsellor’s ties to India date back to her childhood, when her mother, Daw Khin Kyi, served as Myanmar’s ambassador in New Delhi.","/national-news/23180-state-counsellor-meets-indian-pm-other-leaders-at-india-forums.html"

It is a magnet for the most impoverished migrant workers and the most ruthless exploiters. Its haunts are a cauldron of armed conflict beyond the law of the land. In what could be one of its most challenging tests, how will Myanmar’s democratic government deal with the green curse of jade?           A well-managed extractive industries sector would attract responsible domestic and overseas investors who employed well-paid workers protected by robust safety standards, producing rare and valued assets that would help fill the nation’s tax coffers and pay for its public services.How do we get from here to there?Kachin State has for decades been a cockpit of conflict between government forces and local armed groups. Hpakant, the epicentre of the jade trade, is not a destination for the faint of heart.The hundreds of thousands of workers who have made their way there are badly paid and exploited, and are often prey to drugs. Hundreds have died in the past year in landslides as the towering hills of tailings regularly collapse on wildcatters scrabbling for scraps that could mean the difference between life and starvation.Yet vast profits can be made there, mostly to the benefit of shadowy foreign companies and their local collaborators. Their depredations have been so voracious that some experts fear that the jade deposits could be stripped clean within 10 years.Under these circumstances, many in Myanmar might think to themselves, “Good riddance.”Data from the gems industry suggests there are 7400 active jade fields in Hpakant and Lone Khin, and 1000 expired fields. Heavy machines imported from China under the previous government are working day and night to extract the treasure that is left.Local residents want the digging to stop.Pyithu Hluttaw MP U Tint Soe (NLD; Hpakant) has urged the imposition of strict controls.“The government should review jade excavations, or Hpakant’s jade will be gone within 10 years. We must stop excavation,” he said.Between 2011 and 2016, the government received K1430.33 billion from the metals sector, K1060.33 billion from the gems sector and K1010.34 billion from jade sector. The total value of the jade exported to China and Hong Kong during that period was estimated at 5.1 billion euros (US$5.63 billion), according to Myanmar gems industry sources.But one year ago, Global Witness, an international NGO based in Britain, released a report saying Myanmar’s jade fields produced US$31 billion in 2014 alone, a sum equivalent to 48 percent of the country’s GDP and 46 times the size of its health budget. Of this sum, only about 10pc reverted to the state in tax.The cost is more than just financial. The once-green fields around Hpakant are a scene of industrial devastation, as towering, sterile mountains of slag thousands of feet high disfigure the landscape. Heavy rains turn those hills into killing traps. More deaths are caused by collisions between passenger cars and the heavy trucks employed by the mining firms.U Tun Hla Aung, secretary of the Jewellery Entrepreneurs’ Association, has called on all jade mining companies to devise an environmental management plan with input from the Union and state governments, local residents and experts.More than 300,000 people are estimated to be employed around Hpakant. They come from all over Myanmar. In 2015, at least 36 landslides were reported. In the landslide that occurred on November 26 last year, nearly 200 migrant workers were killed. Many of their bodies were never recovered. Yet still the scavengers come. Last May, at least 13 were killed in a pit collapse.U Ohn Win, Union minister for natural resources and environmental conservation, has threatened to arrest jade scavengers and send them home, and prevent others from coming to Hpakant. The government has since drawn attention to the Myanmar Gemstone Law, which provides for up to seven years’ jail for prospecting without a licence and related offences.Ko Myo Zaw, a Rakhine State native now scavenging for gems scraps in Hpakant, said, “We have six family members. There are no jobs at home, so I have to work here and send money back to my family. I haven’t found any jade in six months. But what else can I do?”It’s not that he doesn’t understand the risks. “You have to follow the tracks made by the water in the slopes during the rainy season. You have to concentrate so hard you can miss the signs that a collapse is coming. We’re all afraid to die. But we can’t think about the risks when we have families to support.”Many in Lower Myanmar stay at home, on the farms and in the fisheries, despite the low wages. Others, attracted to the mines by the lure of jade, now find they can’t go home again.U Win Tun from Pakokku township, Magwe Region, has survived seven years of the scavenging life. “I can earn enough to send my children to school and keep them healthy. But if I went back home, I could not survive. We are prepared to protest against the government’s threat to send us to prison. We have to work, or we will suffer more.”In response to such pleas, voices have been raised in favour of cracking down on the employers, rather than the employees. “The scavengers are trying to strike gold in the rubbish heaps. They can lose their life doing that. The government should make the companies responsible for the safety of their workers, and try to improve the conditions of the scavengers,” said the Hpakant MP U Tint Soe. He said he wanted amendments to a draft gemstones law coming before hluttaw that, he said, would in its present form provide insufficient help for mineworkers, local residents and freelance scavengers.According to Global Witness spokesperson Jumen Kubba, 90pc of the Hpakant entrepreneurs are Chinese, and 50pc to 80pc of the jade extracted was smuggled into China. U Tint Soe said, “The government has to take action. The entrepreneurs are getting the profits, and our country gets almost nothing.“New findings and analysis by Global Witness put the value of Myanmar’s jade production as high as $31 billion in 2014 alone. But little or none of that comes back to the government. The government needs to look into the operations of the entrepreneurs and the smuggling. There are so-called ethnic entrepreneurs who are working for the benefit of rich Chinese people, who form the majority of people in the jade industry. The information they assemble should be taken into account when they issue mining permits.”Mandalay’s Mahar Aung Myay Kyauk Wine is Myanmar’s principal jade market. It has been very quiet for the past two or three years. Chinese customers, who used to dominate its halls, no longer come in great numbers, and the quality and quantity of jade available for them to buy have declined, say traders.To improve access to the larger international market, and to reduce dependence on the Chinese market alone, the commerce ministry’s Trade Promotion Department is preparing to include the jade and gemstones sector in the National Export Strategy. It is not yet clear how far the recent promise by US President Barack Obama to remove remaining sanctions on Myanmar and its gems trade will help in this regard. “Gems and jade were smuggled into China under the last government, and they are still being smuggled under this government,” said trader U Myo Zaw.Improved management and government supervision, a crackdown on cross-border smuggling, tighter safety laws, and more effective collection of taxes will be needed if the jade industry is to be tamed and its revenues put to use by the state.This will require, at the very least, an end to armed conflict in Kachin State and the imposition of the rule of law. In its dealings with the Kachin Independence Organisation and its armed wing, the Kachin Independence Army, as well as in its handling of the government’s own armed forces, the government will have to get to grips with these problems.Intensive negotiations over state regulation to improve security and tax collection will have to go hand in hand. And finally, economic and social development, fuelled by both foreign direct investment and the taxes to be derived from the jade mines, will have to be stimulated in the states and regions that are home to the army of scavengers, to enable them to find safer and better-paying work back home.It’s going to take a lot of time and effort to escape the curse of jade.Translation by Khine Thazin Han, Win Thaw Tar, San Layy and Emoon","/national-news/23083-jade-curse-tests-post-sanctions-myanmar.html"

But if I went back home, I could not survive. We are prepared to protest against the government’s threat to send us to prison. We have to work, or we will suffer more.”In response to such pleas, voices have been raised in favour of cracking down on the employers, rather than the employees. “The scavengers are trying to strike gold in the rubbish heaps. They can lose their life doing that. The government should make the companies responsible for the safety of their workers, and try to improve the conditions of the scavengers,” said the Hpakant MP U Tint Soe. He said he wanted amendments to a draft gemstones law coming before hluttaw that, he said, would in its present form provide insufficient help for mineworkers, local residents and freelance scavengers.According to Global Witness spokesperson Jumen Kubba, 90pc of the Hpakant entrepreneurs are Chinese, and 50pc to 80pc of the jade extracted was smuggled into China. U Tint Soe said, “The government has to take action. The entrepreneurs are getting the profits, and our country gets almost nothing.“New findings and analysis by Global Witness put the value of Myanmar’s jade production as high as $31 billion in 2014 alone. But little or none of that comes back to the government. The government needs to look into the operations of the entrepreneurs and the smuggling. There are so-called ethnic entrepreneurs who are working for the benefit of rich Chinese people, who form the majority of people in the jade industry. The information they assemble should be taken into account when they issue mining permits.”Mandalay’s Mahar Aung Myay Kyauk Wine is Myanmar’s principal jade market. It has been very quiet for the past two or three years. Chinese customers, who used to dominate its halls, no longer come in great numbers, and the quality and quantity of jade available for them to buy have declined, say traders.To improve access to the larger international market, and to reduce dependence on the Chinese market alone, the commerce ministry’s Trade Promotion Department is preparing to include the jade and gemstones sector in the National Export Strategy. It is not yet clear how far the recent promise by US President Barack Obama to remove remaining sanctions on Myanmar and its gems trade will help in this regard. “Gems and jade were smuggled into China under the last government, and they are still being smuggled under this government,” said trader U Myo Zaw.Improved management and government supervision, a crackdown on cross-border smuggling, tighter safety laws, and more effective collection of taxes will be needed if the jade industry is to be tamed and its revenues put to use by the state.This will require, at the very least, an end to armed conflict in Kachin State and the imposition of the rule of law. In its dealings with the Kachin Independence Organisation and its armed wing, the Kachin Independence Army, as well as in its handling of the government’s own armed forces, the government will have to get to grips with these problems.Intensive negotiations over state regulation to improve security and tax collection will have to go hand in hand. And finally, economic and social development, fuelled by both foreign direct investment and the taxes to be derived from the jade mines, will have to be stimulated in the states and regions that are home to the army of scavengers, to enable them to find safer and better-paying work back home.It’s going to take a lot of time and effort to escape the curse of jade.Translation by Khine Thazin Han, Win Thaw Tar, San Layy and Emoon","/home-page/in-depth/24375-jade-curse-tests-post-sanctions-myanmar-2.html"
"144",144,"The US, the new Myanmar and the dragon looming in the background",2016-10-05,"Opinion","Myanmar's democratic transition and the consequent dynamics between Nay Pyi Taw and Washington have commanded strategic priority for America’s Asia policy. China’s long years of influence in Myanmar and the latter’s new overtures to diversify its relationships lend geostrategic significance to US-Myanmar ties. As the Obama years come to a close, and the White House prepares for its new president, how the US-Myanmar relationship pans out will be of interest to America’s strategic competitors and partners alike.           On September 14, during State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s official visit to the US, President Barack Obama returned Myanmar to the status of a “least-developed beneficiary developing country”. This allows the US to restore trade benefits by reinstating preferential treatment to Myanmar under the Generalized System of Preferences program. Calling Myanmar’s transition “remarkable”, Mr Obama scrapped those sanctions that could be lifted without congressional authorisation in order to reward the Southeast Asian nation for the progress made so far.But not all sanctions could be removed immediately with an executive order of the president. Under the George W Bush administration, the US Congress passed the Burma Freedom and Democracy Act to ban all imports from Myanmar. In 2013, the Obama administration relaxed some provisions of the act, but continued the ban on imports of precious stones.It was believed that the trade in rubies and gems was run by corporations controlled by the military and clandestine businesses, which in turn promoted corruption and human rights abuses. Additionally, the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) of the US Treasury Department maintains a Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, which prohibits American companies from having business associations with the entities and individuals mentioned. The list includes “individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries” as well as “terrorists and narcotics traffickers designated under programs that are not country-specific”.In May this year, OFAC removed seven enterprises and three state-owned banks in Myanmar from the sanctions list. OFAC also added a general licence allowing US citizens to live and conduct business in Myanmar. At the same time, OFAC added six companies to the SDN list which were owned by Steven Law and his company Asia World, even though the company claims to have sold its mining operations and that it no longer has any interest in the jade sector. However, Asia World is one of Myanmar’s biggest conglomerates and similar sanctions on other businesspeople have made it difficult for foreign investors to enter Myanmar’s market by restricting options for local partners in potential joint ventures. This indicates that despite its commitment to help Myanmar progress economically and sustain its democracy, the US is still treading cautiously as it goes about normalising its relations with the country.Mr Obama faces domestic opposition in the US Congress from those who think persisting concerns regarding military involvement in dubious business operations warrant continued sanctions. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s own policy on human rights violations against the Rohingya has been a subject of extensive debate for some time.While the Obama administration can take credit for defrosting ties with Myanmar’s military establishment, it is believed that the US Congress is in the driver’s seat in US-Myanmar relations, especially after the Republican Party’s 2014 congressional election victories. This has been highlighted by the steep budgetary cuts in military training to Myanmar and the reporting requirements the National Defense Authorization Act imposes on the Department of Defense for all military training or consultation offered to the Tatmadaw. This could create more scope for China to increase its influence in the country through enhanced military relations. China has over the years also injected itself as a power broker in Myanmar by supporting strong minority rebel groups like the United Wa State Army, something that a distant power like the US cannot manage.China became an important economic partner for Myanmar during its period of international isolation under the military government. With its recent democratic transition, it was believed that increasing investments from the West would help Myanmar reduce its economic dependence on China. So far, however, investments from the US and elsewhere in the West have been unable to match those from China.The National League for Democracy government finds itself forced to assure Beijing of the safety of its key investment projects as Myanmar strengthens ties with the US. Key among these is the Myitsone dam project, over which Beijing is increasingly applying pressure for a speedy resolution. However, the NLD, which also recently convened the 21st-century Panglong Peace Conference to unite Myanmar’s different ethnic groups, is sensitive to the hostilities which are likely to break out with the Kachin should the Myitsone project go ahead as it is expected to submerge several villages in the project area.Thus, national security also becomes a driving force behind the need for Myanmar to develop new partners as a way of ensuring its economic growth. On that front, the US will have an important role to play in making it viable for investors to venture into what has been called Asia’s last frontier economy. To this end, the joint statement by Mr Obama and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi inspires confidence by announcing that the US-Myanmar partnership will be anchored on annual cross-sectoral dialogue between the US Department of State and Myanmar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.However, when asked when the sanctions will be lifted in entirety, the only timeframe offered by Mr Obama was “soon”.

"145",145,"Illegal foreign-run businesses in Yangon MPs’ crosshairs",2016-10-05,"Yangon","Amid much talk of luring outside investment to Myanmar, Yangon Region lawmakers have indicated that they want to see greater scrutiny of foreign operators of illegal businesses in the commercial capital.          Regional MPs yesterday approved a proposal to debate cracking down on these foreign entrepreneurs next week.Parliamentarian U Win Maung (NLD; Hlaing Tharyar 1) submitted the proposal at yesterday’s parliamentary session, telling lawmakers that Yangon Region authorities had for too long turned a blind eye to illegal enterprises ranging from gambling dens and real estate ventures to KTV outfits and drinking holes.By the Myanmar Real Estate Service Association’s estimate, he said, as of June 20 there were about 100 foreign real estate agencies that were operating without licences and related permissions from the relevant ministries, most of them Chinese and Korean.U Win Maung said foreign businesspeople had for years taken advantage of a corrupt bureaucracy and weak rule of law to set up shop in Yangon without going through the proper channels.“I wondered when I saw a boarding-house that is owned by a foreign businessman in a squatter area of Hlaing Tharyar township. Those businesses won’t be giving any tax to the government,” he said.The MP said so-called K5K shops – peddling goods priced at a flat K5000 and typically owned by Chinese nationals – had proliferated this year without licences from Yangon City Development Committee and related authorities. Some foreigner-owned bars and restaurants were also suspect, he added.“I can say that the government won’t get any tax from them and the government should take action effectively. The country and our people won’t get any benefits from these kinds of businesses. The government should consider that,” said U Win Maung.MP U Hla Htay (NLD; Mingalar Taung Nyunt 1) said the government must handle the issue in accordance with the Foreign Investment Law.“The government shouldn’t be just monitoring and inspecting these businesses. They should take action against them,” he said.The regional parliament will debate the proposal on October 11.“I think that this proposal will help advance rule of law. And foreigners will respect our country if we have a strong rule of law system,” said U Win Maung.While unlicensed businesses were in Yangon Region MPs’ crosshairs yesterday, the National League for Democracy government has followed in its predecessor’s footsteps in encouraging foreign businesses to legally enter the country. State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said on her visit to the United States last month that such investment would help spur economic development at home.According to Myanmar’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration, approved investment for the 2015-16 fiscal year hit US$9.4 billion.","/national-news/yangon/22898-illegal-foreign-run-businesses-in-yangon-mps-crosshairs.html"
"146",146,"Public call for Myitsone to be scrapped amid China overture",2016-09-20,"National News","The consensus is overwhelming. Kachin locals want the Myitsone megadam to be scrapped, the commission tasked with reviewing the currently suspended project heard this weekend.           Commission members undertook a field visit to Kachin State from September 15 to 18, and surveyed residents and local civil society groups around Myitkyina, the state capital. The cacophony of dissent left little wiggle room for interpretation, not just over the Myitsone dam but also about several other hydropower projects slated for development along the Maykha and Malikha rivers, tributaries to the Ayeyarwady.“All people we spoke with demanded we cancel the seven hydropower projects under review. We noted the people’s voices and will incorporate their comments in our report,” said a commission member, speaking on condition of anonymity.Kachin CSOs slammed the visiting commission, however, as the members did not make time for the one-on-one meeting the local organisations had requested. Instead, the commission for reviewing and scrutinising hydropower projects along the Ayeyarwady River held a townhall-style dialogue.“Only 13 people were allowed to speak during the meeting. None of them were members of local CSOs, though they all also objected to these projects. All 653 attendees were there to voice their objection,” said Daw Nan Pu, a member of the Htoi Genda Foundation.Yesterday, the commission released a statement in state-owned media saying that they are still in the process of scrutinising documents related to the hydropower projects along the Ayeyarwady River.“The commission will collaborate not only with local experts but also foreign experts, as necessary,” the statement said.The statement added that commission members have been briefed by the Myitsone hydropower project’s developers, China Power Investment Corporation, on the power supply arrangement. Much of the controversy over the project, and the public resistance to it, stems from the fact that 90 percent of the electricity generated would be transmitted to China.“CPI’s officials want to continue the project but we cannot give an answer to them yet,” a commission member said.The commission has been tasked with reviewing project contracts and finding solutions that will balance both the needs of the local people and the environment they depend on, and relations with foreign investors eager to capitalise on untapped natural resources.The commission must submit an initial report to the president on November 11, though members have indicated that no major recommendations will be included in the document due to the short timetable for the report’s release.China’s CPI Yunnan International Power Investment Company entered into an agreement to develop the US$3.6 billion Myitsone dam with a military-owned conglomerate and the government in 2006.Then-president U Thein Sein suspended the 4600-megawatt project in 2011 amid widespread public outcry.Daw Ja Hkaung, a member of the Mungchying Rawt Jat organisation in Kachin State and a veteran opponent of the Myitsone project, said the commission should accept the public consensus.“If the commission fails to listen to the people’s voice, the government will be accused of ignoring the wishes of the people,” she said.Seemingly fearful of an impending cancellation, Chinese state-run media yesterday also addressed the public backlash against the Myitsone dam.Noting that suspension of the project was a sore spot in bilateral relations with Myanmar, The Study Times, a newspaper run by the Communist Party of China, said Myanmar was paying attention to “resolving Sino-Myanmar economic cooperation difficulties”, including “the problem of the Myitsone dam”.The paper called on State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to avoid a “lose-lose” solution in regard to Myitsone, and took pains to note China’s costly investments in the neighbouring country.“With regards to the Myitsone dam in Kachin State, we are seeking an appropriate solution. This means the [National League for Democracy] will not agree with the previous government’s indifference toward this issue,” the paper said. It added that during Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s trip to China last month, “extreme” voices in Myanmar media fomented public objections to the continuation of the Myitsone project.“The people’s extreme opinions flood Myanmar’s privately owned media, causing a huge surge in negative opinion, which can greatly destroy the cooperation between Myanmar and China,” it said.With additional reporting by Lillian Kalish","/national-news/22613-public-call-for-myitsone-to-be-scrapped-amid-china-overture.html"
"147",147,"Labour rights reforms and impatient unions a challenge for NLD",2016-09-15,"National News","Myanmar’s growing industrial workforce is becoming increasingly unionised and assertive.          Ma Myat Thiri Nwe left her poor village in Ayeyarwady Region three years ago to find work in Myanmar’s commercial capital Yangon and soon after arriving found a job in one of the many garment and shoe factories on the city’s outskirts.The 24-year-old now works at a Chinese-owned shoe factory, where she toils six days per week from 8am to 5:30pm, a daily shift that includes several hours of overtime to meet production targets and raise her income.Through this gruelling schedule, she earns about K160,000 (US$136) per month, one-third of which she sends to her family back in the village.Workers and labour unions complain working conditions at the factory are poor and even dangerous. There is no canteen and only a few outdoor toilets, and Ma Myat Thiri Nwe’s tasks include looking after a machine that stamps rubber soles onto shoes – if it jams she has to manually remove the shoe.Another worker, she said, lost a finger in an accident with the machine a year ago.“Sometimes, I ask myself whether I am really benefiting from my work. But I cannot stop as I need to support my family,” she said. “And I cannot take much leave - when my father was seriously ill I could only go home for four days.”Like most workers and union members in Myanmar’s quickly growing garment sector, Ma Myat Thiri Nwe voted for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in last November’s elections, hoping that her National League for Democracy (NLD) would be able to raise incomes and improve working conditions for the urban poor.In what is perhaps one of its most important challenges for the government, the NLD must balance the demands of labour unions, factory owners and foreign investors to keep Myanmar’s garment industry growing and distribute the benefits among an expectant, poor labour force.So far, after about five months in office, the NLD’s efforts in this area have made little impression on Yangon’s workers and unions.Ma Myat Thiri Nwe said, “I do not understand politics, but I think we are losing our labour rights even though we are working hard. Garment workers have not enjoyed improved working conditions.”“Myanmar labourers have not seen noticeable developments that benefit them. We have not secured any more labour rights,” said Ko Ye Naing Win, policy director of Cooperating Committee for Trade Union that provides educational workshops on workers’ rights. “And the country will not develop well if it cannot ensure labour rights.”Labour lawsIn recent years there have been some improvements in Myanmar’s labour rights situation. The previous government set the first minimum wage at K3600 ($2.80) for an eight-hour workday last year after pressure from international garment brands and years of negotiations.But Myanmar only legalised unions in 2011 and industrial relations – and laws and mechanisms to govern them – remain undeveloped.Since the start of democratic reforms, the garment sector has expanded rapidly and, according international brand representatives and the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association, the sector’s value could grow from around $912 million in 2012 to $8 billion in 2022, by when it could employ 1.5 million workers.Currently, local, Chinese and South Korean-owned factories around Yangon employ around 300,000 workers, mostly young women.A December 2015 survey by UK-based aid group Oxfam among workers in Yangon found, however, that the new minimum wage “will not be enough for workers to look after themselves and their families”. It noted that 43 percent of workers interviewed at 22 factories were “trapped in debt”.The report said one-quarter of the workers were forced to work overtime. Oxfam said, “Often, factory managers do not listen to workers when they raise problems,” adding, “Safety was a big concern. More than one in three workers reported that they had been injured at work.”Ma Win Theingi Soe, a representative of workers at Yes One Garment Factory and a central committee member of the All-Myanmar Labour Federation, said it was unclear how many factories have started paying the minimum wage and other benefits required by law.“Some workers seek our help to set up labour unions at their factories because workers who are not members of a union do not get a minimum wage,” she said, adding that employers often lay off workers who get involved with labour unions.Ko Phoe Phyu, a labour rights lawyer, said labour dispute arbitration is still in its infancy in Myanmar and its outcomes are inconsistent.“Many labour laws don’t specifically define labour rights. The new government should improve this,” he said, adding that current laws only fine employers for labour rights violations and this should be changed to include revoking of business licences.U Thein Tun, an NLD lower house member and secretary of the Farmers and Workers Affairs Committee, agreed that amendments were required to improve labour conditions.“The amendment of existing labour laws play a key role in promoting labour rights and decent wages. We are trying to do so,” he told Myanmar Now. “[But] we will try to amend the labour laws of the previous government only if we found weakness or flaws.”He said his committee had identified six laws – some of which are decades old, such as the Employment Statistics Acts of 1948 and the Employment Restriction Act of 1959 – that should be revised.But a first priority, he said, was progress in Myanmar’s peace process, adding that its success would stimulate economic growth and investment, and so improve the job market and working conditions. Settling disputesMany labour disputes in Myanmar concern wages. Last year, almost half of the total 1019 registered disputes dealt with this issue, according to government figures. Among these disputes, 353 were settled among the parties and 165 cases went to court.U Aye Tun, vice chair of the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association, said the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population often favoured workers when arbitrating labour disputes.“In most disputes, the Labour Department orders us to fulfil the demand of labourers to increase wages, without taking into account the difficulties of employers,” he said.Employers pay 5 percent of workers’ salaries to government-run welfare programs, amounting to around $30 million per year, he said. But government inefficiency made it hard for workers who suffer illness and injury to access these benefits.U Nyunt Win, a director general at the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population, said both employers and workers needed to understand each other better. Since the NLD took office, his department had provided training on labour rights to factory managers, supervisors and workers at 3342 factories, he said.Ko Phyo Wai Aung, 26, a leader of a labour union formed at Great Wall 1 Shoe Factory in Yangon, said he had led demands for better working conditions and wages, but was fired from his job in May 2015 for his activities.His case ended up in court – though he won, the punishment meant little to the factory.“The factory was fined K1 million [about $830] as it failed to reappoint me in accordance with the court verdict. This amount of cash fine is very small for the factory owner. I will continue my case in the upper courts,” he said.U Moe Moe Myint Khaing, manager of the Human Resources Department at Great Wall 1, said the factory was open to workers’ suggestions, but said there had been no formal complaints and declined to comment on Ko Phyo Wai Aung’s case.– Republished with permission of Myanmar Now","/national-news/22523-labour-rights-reforms-and-impatient-unions-a-challenge-for-nld.html"
"148",148,"Myanmar is rebalancing, not pivoting, foreign relations",2016-09-14,"Opinion","Myanmar's new government is making its international debut. In mid-August, Beijing welcomed Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on her first visit to China since becoming Myanmar’s state counsellor and foreign minister. This followed her trips to Myanmar’s ASEAN neighbours Laos and Thailand and preceded President U Htin Kyaw’s landmark visit to India. On September 14 to 15, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will travel to Washington, DC. Myanmar’s busy diplomatic calendar carries special significance after the landslide electoral victory of the National League for Democracy (NLD) in November 2015.          Myanmar’s reforms, which notably picked up speed in 2011, are related to Nay Pyi Taw’s recently strained relations with Beijing. A major factor propelling the political transition was concern for over-reliance on China. Since 1988, Myanmar faced international isolation and sanctions for violating human rights and repressing pro-democracy actors. China stepped in with trade, investment, military hardware and training, and diplomatic support to fend off UN resolutions. This assistance afforded China access to Myanmar’s rich natural resources and a strategic outlet to the Bay of Bengal intended to mitigate its “Malacca Dilemma”.However, China’s extensive economic presence in Myanmar encountered popular resentment, particularly in extractive industries. Residents complained about environmental degradation, insufficient compensation for expropriated land, labour abuses, and that Chinese firms often hired workers brought in from across the border rather than locals. Meanwhile, Myanmar elites expressed reservations about ties between Chinese actors (particularly from neighbouring Yunnan province) and ethnic armed groups like the United Wa State Army.After Myanmar shed its pariah status and began to diversify its diplomatic and economic relations, its new willingness to court partners like the United States, India and Japan raised anxiety in Beijing and Kunming that economic interests could be compromised and that Nay Pyi Taw could be integrated into a strategy of “encircling” or “containing” China.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s decision to visit China before the US seems to have assuaged fears that Myanmar is seeking to pivot away from Beijing and toward Washington. A joint statement with President Xi Jinping reaffirmed the bilateral pauk-phaw (“kinfolk”) relationship and pledged cooperation on border security, trade, climate change, natural disasters and communicable diseases. China expressed support for Myanmar’s democratic transition and national reconciliation, while Myanmar welcomed the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative and affirmed the One China principle regarding Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet.Further strengthening ties, China and Myanmar inked a deal to build two hospitals in Yangon and Mandalay, as well as to construct a bridge at Kunlone in Shan State, a potentially important link for the proposed Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor and OBOR initiative.Even more significant was Chinese willingness to attempt to persuade several holdouts among Myanmar’s ethnic armed groups to attend the 21st-century Panglong Conference aimed at building a permanent peace with the central government. Beijing has clearly communicated its strategic interest in maintaining good relations with Nay Pyi Taw.In Washington, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will likely encounter a warm welcome from an Obama administration eager to solidify Myanmar as one of its foreign policy successes. To reward and help consolidate Myanmar’s democratisation process, the Obama administration is considering further reducing sanctions. However, Congressional and NGO concerns about the military’s enduring political role and the treatment of ethnic Rohingya – tens of thousands of whom have been displaced by communal violence – may limit further sanctions relief. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s assurances of Myanmar’s positive trajectory on human rights can influence US sanctions policy. However, the phased rather than expedited lifting of targeted sanctions may have political utility for the NLD as a bargaining chip with the Tatmadaw military leadership, and as domestic political justification to pursue further reforms.Compared to human rights issues, US officials will be less concerned about Myanmar repairing ties with China or cooperating with Beijing on infrastructure projects. As former US ambassador to Myanmar Derek Mitchell recently said, the United States has not opposed China’s infrastructure projects in Myanmar so long as they are “transparent, acceptable to the people and environmentally sound”.Washington and Beijing can avoid tensions related to zero-sum perceptions of Myanmar’s reform and opening by supporting international standards and greater transparency. What does this mean in practice?In economic development, international firms in Myanmar should enhance corporate social responsibility; some have already adopted the ISO 26000 standard, for example. Nay Pyi Taw should increase democratic oversight of international economic agreements and state-backed development. Myanmar’s new commission on hydroelectric projects (including the Myitsone dam), represents a positive step and is expected to issue its first report in November. China and the United States should support Myanmar’s anti-corruption efforts as a way to increase predictability and reduce the costs of doing business for foreign investors and companies. Open-bid contracts for infrastructure projects would encourage productive competition and provide Nay Pyi Taw with political cover to pursue needed infrastructure improvements.Myanmar’s peacebuilding efforts need greater transparency and legislation to bring laws and practices in line with international norms. More transparency is needed along the Myanmar-China border, where observers from the European Union and elsewhere could be helpful if they were allowed access. Finally, while the Tatmadaw seeks the ability to purchase arms from the US, Washington can reassure Beijing that mil-mil relations with Myanmar are focused on expanding best practices, including nonproliferation standards, not pursuing defense contracts or geopolitical advantage.Myanmar’s reform and opening has begun to improve conditions for its people, who were long denied the benefits of international trade and exchange. The present flurry of diplomacy is encouraging, but human rights and economic development in Myanmar still have a long way to go.Nay Pyi Taw is not pivoting away from Beijing; it is rebalancing its foreign relations to manage domestic pressures and pursue international opportunities. To avoid counterproductive perceptions of favouring business interests over public welfare, military interests over ethnic inclusion, or the interests of some diplomatic partners at the expense of others, Myanmar’s strategy should be to focus on meeting international standards of governance. Expect this to be a theme of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s visit to Washington.– Pacific Forum CSIS PacNetJonathan T Chow is an assistant professor in the Department of Government and Public Administration at the University of Macau.

The temporary suspension of the project came up for renegotiation as the National League for Democracy took office at the end of March, with Chinese officials pressing an urgent restart, and locals demanding a cancellation.The Chinese-backed mega-project is seen as a pivotal test of Sino-Myanmar relations under the new administration, and analysts anticipated a decision in a six-month time frame.But after a commission meeting yesterday, one of the members said a yes-or-no decision will not be possible by the first reporting deadline of November 11, or even shortly thereafter.“The first report won’t be the final one. The time frame for submitting it is too short,” the commission member who spoke on condition of anonymity said. “A second and third and probably a lot more reports will be sent to the president.”The commission for reviewing and scrutinising hydropower projects along the Ayeyarwady River held its third meeting in Nay Pyi Taw yesterday. Members said they have finished reviewing the Myitsone contract, but will now need to undertake a field site to discuss the project with local residents.Long before taking office, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi had penned letters against the US$3.6 billion dam. But the state counsellor, who has attempted to cement strong ties with neighbouring China, has more recently hedged on the project, saying a review of the contract was necessary to ensure it will benefit the people.The Myitsone dam – which would flood a confluence of historic importance to ethnic Kachin – is deplored by the local residents, who say it will cause substantial environmental damage while transmitting 90 percent of the power generated to China.Families relocated to compounds 8 miles (13 kilometres) from the dam site have said the remote model villages are infertile and the promised food subsidies have fallen far short of the required amount.But even after then-president U Thein Sein called a halt to the project in 2011 amid public pressure and increased fighting between the Tatmadaw and the Kachin Independence Army, the 500 relocated households were not permitted to return home.Daw Ja Hkaung, a member of the Mungchying Rawt Jat organisation in Kachin State and a veteran opponent of the Myitsone project, said local residents plan to stage a protest and hold a press conference on September 9 in Myitkyina.“The residents [displaced by the Myitsone dam] want to return to their homes,” she said.“They want the government to act courageously on their behalf and to cancel the project. The government already knows this is what the Myanmar people need.”The military government and Chinese developer China Power Investment (CPI) had inked a contract for a 6000 megawatt hydropower project on the confluence of the country’s biggest river, the Ayeyarwady, in 2006.CPI, which did not return requests for comment yesterday, has pushed for a restart on the grounds that it did not get a fair opportunity to disseminate information about the dam’s benefits before it was suspended. Should the new government choose to terminate the contract, it would have to reimburse the developer for any investments.","/national-news/22357-more-delays-for-long-awaited-decision-on-myitsone-dam.html"
"151",151,"Hydropower commission probes Myitsone contract",2016-09-02,"National News","The commission to scrutinise hydropower projects along the Aye­yarwady River has met with the Ministry of Electric Power and Energy to learn more about the contractual agreement with a Chinese state-owned firm underpinning the suspended Myitsone hydropower project in Kachin State.          The commission held its second meeting August 30 in Nay Pyi Taw, and its members will soon travel to the sites of hydropower dams in Kachin State to interview local residents and observe conditions on the ground in the project areas.Irrigation expert U Cho Cho, who is a member of the commission, told The Myanmar Times yesterday that the commission had begun reviewing the Myitsone agreement and was working hard to submit its preliminary report on time. The government, which formed the hydropower scrutiny commission on August 12, has ordered that its first report be compiled by November 11.The 20-member commission has been tasked with reviewing proposed and existing hydropower projects along the length of Myanmar’s main waterway, which begins in Kachin State at the site of the Myitsone dam. The scrutiny is to include recommendations on whether or not proposed projects should go forward, analysing costs and benefits for the public.Part of the process includes reviewing contracts inked by previous governments. The commission has been ordered to find the best solutions for Myanmar’s people that will also be palatable to foreign investors who have a stake in the outcomes of the report and subsequent decisions by State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s government.It has also been instructed to compile the opinions of citizens and civil society organisations in its review.“I think in our first report it cannot be mentioned whether the projects should continue or not because the timetable is too short. The second report will be better than the first report,” said U Cho Cho.Daw Ja Hkaung, a member of the Kachin State-based Mungchying Rawt Jat organisation, which was an early opponent of the Myitsone project, said the commission needed to do more, and that people did not want to see its members “wasting their time” with meetings in Nay Pyi Taw.“We [Mungchying Rawt Jat] and most people are monitoring their activities and the commission’s first report,” she said.The commission also intends to submit an interim report within the next month.State-owned China Power Investment Corporation entered into a joint venture to develop the US$3.6 billion Myitsone dam with local conglomerate Asia World and the Ministry of Electric Power under the former junta government. The project was suspended in 2011 by then-president U Thein Sein, who cited widespread public opposition to the mega-dam.Contributing to Myitsone’s unpopularity was the widespread displacement of populations in the project area, concerns about the dam’s environmental impacts and the terms of an agreement that would see some 90 percent of the electricity generated sent to China.The controversial dam was on the agenda when Daw Aung San Suu Kyi met with Chinese leaders in Beijing last month, though the state counsellor deferred any major decision, saying that would have to await the results of the Ayeyarwady River commission’s review.","/national-news/22294-hydropower-commission-probes-myitsone-contract.html"
"152",152,"What’s next for Myanmar-China relations?",2016-08-31,"Opinion","China and Myanmar have shared a geopolitically strategic 2185-kilometre (1358-mile) border since the end of World War II. During the great power politics of the post-war era, the leaderships of the two nations fine-tuned postures of neutrality and non-alignment throughout the Cold War. U Nu and Zhou Enlai, the premiers of the two nations, stood together at the forefront of the non-aligned movement.           But the relationship was hardly a model of shared-border brotherhood. While the Chinese Communist Party supported the Communist Party of Burma until 1989, General Ne Win’s Burma Socialist Programme Party stoked xenophobic anti-Chinese sentiment in then-Burma, despite the fact that he himself was half-Chinese by birth. While countless analysts of China-Myanmar dynamics have concentrated on the nonetheless enduring pauk phaw relationship between these two nations, early indications are that Myanmar’s state counsellor and foreign minister, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, will change the diplomatic equation once more.Since assuming her dual roles, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has practiced pragmatism, sending signals that her country will be neither a satellite state nor a peripheral player in China’s regional rise.After the Cold War in 1989, Beijing and Yangon both adopted a “development first, democracy later” approach. But even as China became the Myanmar junta’s biggest supporter over the 1988-2011 period, the two countries embarked on markedly divergent economic paths.According to UN data, the per capita GDP of Myanmar and China was US$171 and $311, respectively, in the 1980s. Three decades later, China’s had skyrocketed to $6626, while Myanmar’s per capita GDP was just $1183, in 2013. Growing China’s status as Myanmar’s number-one foreign investor and trading partner was not enough to overcome Western economic sanctions and mismanagement to allow the two nations to rise in tandem.Then in September 2011, the game changed. President U Thein Sein’s suspension of the China-backed Myitsone dam angered Beijing, while also forcing it to launch a charm offensive. To this day, the suspension reminds transnational businesses – in particular Chinese investors – to be more cautious about Myanmar’s changing economic regulatory framework and policies. Since 2011, Myitsone has put the brakes on major Chinese investment in Myanmar.Enter Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. China’s acquaintance with the former opposition leader dates back to her rise to political prominence in 1988, when the then-Chinese ambassador, Cheng Ruisheng, paid the first of several visits to her, including one to the National League for Democracy headquarters just after the party’s 1990 election victory.In December 2014, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi made an official visit to China as opposition leader and sitting parliamentarian. Analysts viewed the invite by Beijing as a move to counter-balance Myanmar’s military-backed ruling government, which had in recent years cooled on the pauk phaw relationship.With this history in mind, the geopolitical significance of this month’s visit by Myanmar’s now de facto leader was rightly played up, not only for bilateral relations but also for ASEAN and its member states.From the Chinese leadership’s perspective, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is considered neither a threat to China nor a supporter of the Chinese democracy and human rights movements, despite her international standing as a democracy icon. Rather, they take her at her word as a self-proclaimed pragmatic politician who now leads a country in China’s backyard. Little wonder Beijing rolled out the red carpet for her just a few months after her government took power.It’s clear that both sides have much to gain from a healthy bilateral relationship. In the years ahead, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi would do well to remember these five points.1) Myanmar needs to take advantage of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the brainchild of Chinese President Xi Jinping, as a means of enhancing the bilateral relationship while profiting from the gains of infrastructure investment in Myanmar. Moreover, Myanmar needs to express its enthusiasm at being involved in the development of the “New Silk Road”, which has the potential to be an engine for future growth in the region, better linking consumers from the world’s two biggest nations, China and India, with fast-growing Southeast Asia and beyond.2) Myanmar needs to encourage the leadership of China to enforce principles of corporate social responsibility and ethical investment in its Myanmar dealings. Many Chinese investment projects in Myanmar need to be re-examined, as most were inked with the previous military junta.3) The state counsellor must make clear that military drills along the shared border – like the one that took place in the aftermath of the Tatmadaw’s errant, fatal bombing of five Chinese villagers last year – are not acceptable. The military manoeuvres came despite an official apology from Nay Pyi Taw. The military exercise was counterproductive, fuelling anti-Chinese sentiment in Myanmar and doubts about China’s stated commitment to a “peaceful rise”.4) Myanmar can be an alleviant to the rising tension between some ASEAN member states and China over territorial claims in the South China Sea. As an ASEAN country with no competing claim in the dispute, Myanmar is well-positioned to contribute to a basic code of conduct in the South China Sea for all concerned stakeholders.Finally, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi can give her assurance that stability in mainland China and continuity of its communist regime is in Myanmar’s best interests. That the country will not be a Chinese vassal, à la Cambodia, nor a democracy-advocating thorn in the side, à la Taiwan or Hong Kong.In order to maximise the benefits for Myanmar and its people, the state counsellor needs to balance her diplomatic stance toward China, the United States, Japan and other regional players. There is little doubt that under her leadership, Myanmar will be a strategic player in ASEAN geopolitics and other contemporary political affairs.Naing Ko Ko is a PhD scholar at the Regulatory Institutions Network, College of Asia and the Pacific, Australian National University.","/opinion/22241-what-s-next-for-myanmar-china-relations.html"
"153",153,"Union Peace Conference 2016",2016-08-26,"National News","Govt, ethnic groups sign 33 agreements at the end of second Panglong          Tuesday, 30 May 2017The government and ethnic armed groups signed a total of 33 agreements at the conclusion of the 2nd round of the 21st century Panglong conference that is expected to move forward the peace talks aimed at ending decades-old pocket wars in the country.Lt General Yar Pyae, vice chair of the Union Peace Dialogue Joint Committee (UPDJC), a tripartite body of government, political parties and ethnic armed groups that is authorized to hold political dialogues described the six-day peace talks as very productive.“We are very pleased because we have never had results in previous talks. We have agreed on 37 points, which is a progress. It would need step-by-step and gradual development. Tatmadaw has already had the desire to achieve eternal peace, and negotiations should continue,” said he.Secession, self-determination haunt second round of Panglong conferenceMonday, 29 May 2017The government and ethnic armed groups have failed to reach an agreement on the issues of secession and self-determination in the final day of the second round of the 21st-Century Panglong Conference.But all the parties agreed to continue the discussion on the issues of non-secession and self-determination during the next round of talks, which has yet to be scheduledThe second round of 21st-Century Panglong Conference is concluding today. Government, political parties and eight signatory groups discussed on the 41 points prepared in advance by the Union Political Dialogue Joint Committee (UPDJC).Wa-led northern groups to meet with State Counsellor todayFriday, 26 May 2017State’s Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has accepted the request of Wa-led groups from northern Myanmar to meet today afternoon in Nay Pyi Taw on the sideline of the ongoing Union Peace Conference, government and ethnic leaders confirmed.The meeting was set during a two-hour closed door meeting between members of the government’s Peace Commission and delegates of the Wa-led groups, officially named “ Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee “ [FPNCC],on May 25 at Horizon Lake View Hotel where FPNCC members are billeted .Dr Tin Myo Win, head of the Peace Commission, did not give details about his meeting with the FPNCC delegates.“I don’t give any comment [about the meeting ] because it’s very sensitive and important,” said Dr TinMyo Win.He said he thanked FPNCC for attending the ongoing second round of 21stPanglong Conference and also thanked China in helping convince the FPNCC to attend the conference.Heated debate on ‘secession’ on second day of Panglong Friday, 26 May 2017A Debate about the appropriateness of including the phrase “non-secession from the union” as part of the basic principle of a peace agreement dominated the second day of the 21st-century Panglong, said representatives from the forum.On the second day of the second round of the 21st-Century Panglong conference held yesterday in Nay Pyi Taw, participants of nearly 700 were divided into five sectors – politics, security, economy, social and land and environment, where they discussed the 41 points prepared in advance by the Union Peace Dialogue Joint Committee (UPDJC) before the conference.The UPDJC is a tripartite committee consisting of the government (including the Tatmadaw), eight signatory armed ethnic groups and political parties’ representatives authorised to draft political dialogue frameworks and hold political dialogues at the national and union level.The Shan Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD), after a morning tea-break yesterday released a statement, expressed their disappointment with the usage of the phrase “non-secession”.State Counsellor upbeat over prospects of Panglong conferenceThursday, 25 May 2017The five-day talks was attended not only by the eight signatory groups to the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), but also by three ethnic armed groups in the northern part of Myanmar who have not yet signed the ceasefire pact.Unlike the first round of Union Peace Conference, held in August of 2016 and ended with no concrete results, the current peace talks is expected to be productive as there would be debates, discussion and consensus-taking among the parties.Participants will also exchange their points of view on four social issues and six land and environmental issue, as well as 21 political problems and 10 economic issues, including the proposal that may allow states and regions to draw their own constitutions,’ regarded as self-determination.Diverting from NCA means unwillingness for peaceThursday, 25 May 2017Diverting from the initiatives spelt out in the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) means there is no willingness for establishing peace, democracy and a federal system in the Union, according to Commander-in-Chief of Defense Services, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.“In implementing peace making processes, the political roadmap described in the NCA is an exit for the Union to be exactly followed by all those involved. The remaining peace-making processes can be done trustfully only when the ongoing armed conflicts come to an end. In practice, the current peace-making processes go beyond the basic principles of the NCA and the roadmap,” said the senior general at the opening ceremony of the second session of the Union Peace Conference-21st Century Panglong.Senior General Min Aung Hlaing said that the discussions, activities and basic concepts of some ethnic groups, that are in the 72 papers submitted at the previous conference, went far beyond the federal system, that was envisaged.Three more rebel groups to join Union Peace ConferenceWednesday, 24 May 2017The three excluded groups of Kokang, Ta’ang and Arakan armed ethnic groups are attending the Union Peace Conference, for the first time, as special guests, government peace negotiators said.But several other rebel groups in southern part of Myanmar under the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) have decided not to join the conference, they added.Despite ongoing fighting in northern part of Shan state, the second session of 21st century Panglong conference would see for the first time, representatives from Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA – Kokang group), Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and Arakan Army (AA), attending the peace talks.Officials from government’s peace negotiation body have confirmed yesterday that the groups together with KIA, Shan State Progressive Party (SSPP), United Wa State Army, National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA) are already in Nay Pyi Taw to attend the union peace conference.Myanmar’s peace process and China’s factorTuesday, 23 May 2017From now on, China’s role, real or imagined, will be extremely pivotal to the progress of the National League of Democracy-led government’s efforts to build peace and stability for Myanmar’s 54 million people.After several postponements of the Union Peace Conference – the 21st Century Panglong (second session) since February, the meeting scheduled for May 24-29 have generated a high level of expectations. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will need the help of all stakeholders, both at home and abroad to make a progress. Obviously, among them, China is at the top.Chinese President Xi Jinping said all the right words to her during their bilateral meeting in Beijing, pledging his country’s help on China-Myanmar border security and stability. “China is willing to continue to provide necessary assistance for Myanmar’s internal peace process,” Xi said confidently. It should surprise nobody that Daw Suu chose to end her week-long visit to China with a stopover in Yunnan to ensure that the provincial top echelon is on the same page as in Beijing.21st Century Panglong and new challengesTuesday, 23 May 2017The second union peace conference is coming soon. There have been many changes in a period between the first and second conferences. However, these are not positive changes leading to the right direction; they are worrisome changes.One major change is the emergence of a new peace pathway directed by the Wa ethnic group. In last February, the Wa group discussed with the armed ethnic groups who had not signed NCA in Pangsang. During the discussion, the Wa ethnic armed group declared that they do not trust the peace pathway proposed by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and advised the team led by Wa group to discuss directly with the government.The Wa group openly rejected Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s pathway to peace via NCA, and preferred to hold new ceasefires discussions. The Wa asked to disregard NCA agreement, and demanded new ceasefire and political discussions. The movement will be led by the Wa group, and the armed ethnic groups from the north side of Myanmar support the idea.Doubts over regional and state constitutional draftingMonday, 22 May 2017The recent meeting of the tripartite Union Peace Dialogue Joint Committee (UPDJC) held in Nay Pyi Taw produced a great result as it agreed to include in the agenda of upcoming second round of the 21st Century Panglong Conference a policy proposal that could allow regions and states to draft their own constitutions.The unprecedented agreement could give regions and states a chance to draw their own charters, which fully reflect the federalism as well as a guarantee for self-determination that ethnic people have constantly demanded. This is the first-ever agreement reached between the government and ethnic armed organizations so that all the attendees of UPDJC meeting described it as a “historic agreement”.“These are basic federal principles. We have never had such an agreement before,” said U Zaw Htay, Director General of the State Counsellor’s Office.Why the five ethnic armed organisations should sign NCAFriday, 19 May 2017The meeting between the government and five non-signatory ethnic armed groups in Chiang Mai, Thailand on April 28 was a big disappointment after it failed to secure promises from the EAOs that they would sign the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement.Such a let-down is common in Myanmar peace negotiations. There will be many more disappointments and uncertainties ahead but it should not deter the government negotiators in pursuing a more inclusive ceasefire.Critically, it is not a lost cause. There is still time. Both sides can iron out their differences in the next meeting scheduled in Yangon before the next Union Peace Conference 21st Century Panglong (UPC) is held on May 24.Welcome to The Myanmar Times coverage of the Union Peace Conference, the cornerstone effort of the new National League for Democracy government-led peace process. Dubbed the '21st Century Panglong Conference' in reference to the landmark 1947 summit led by independence hero Bogyoke Aung San, the Union Peace Conference will be held in Nay Pyi Taw over 4 days, beginning August 31, and will bring together armed ethnic groups, political parties, military officials, and government representatives.The NLD campaigned heavily on the importance of ""national reconciliation"" and has identified the peace process as bedrock effort of its opening agenda, but the new government has also indicated that it sees the conference as only a starting point in an ongoing political dialogue with Myanmar's many ethnic and military players.Scroll below to see our live coverage, or click here to read background and analysis.You can also stream the opening of today's Panglong conference on MRTV here!Not without wrinkles, peace conference lauded for taking landmark ‘first steps’ Monday, 5 SeptemberCriticism, disputes or bumps along the road are no cause for concern; the only thing to fear is not acknowledging the problem at all, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said at the close of a landmark peace summit this weekend (see closing remarks, below).Regardless of the series of mishaps over the four-day conference, the state counsellor nevertheless heralded the event as a successful step toward resolving the country’s entrenched armed conflicts.That concludes our coverage of the 4-day opening Union Peace Conference in August-September, 2016.

The four-day conference saw an overwhelmingly male roster of attendees and speakers.State Counsellor urges unity in Panglong closing remarksState Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi urged Union Peace Conference participants not to dwell on the past, but to consider the future of the Union of Myanmar in her closing remarks at the Panglong Conference.""When I looked at the presentation of groups over the past four days, I know who  is concentrated on things past, and who is focused on how to build our future state. But there is time yet for those stuck on the past to look forward to the future. It is very crucial that commit to bravely moving forward, not for the sake of an individual or an ethnic group, but for the sake of the entire Union,"" Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said, referring to the papers presented over the course of the four-day conference this week.Speaking of criticisms of the conference organisation, she added, ""But we don't need to  fear having problems or set-backs - the threat is of pretending we do not have any problems. The most important thing is the ability to bravely move ahead, and work together on finding solutions,"" she said.She echoed a vow repeated throughout the 4-day conference that the NLD government is committed to achieving lasting peace in Myanmar as their top priority.Panglong Conference day 4 agenda:Leadership:Lieutenant General Ya Pyae - TatmadawDr. Tin Myo Win - GovernmentDaw Shilar Nan Taung - Parliament Khum Myint Tun - EAOU Myint Soe - USDP Speakers: U Aung Kyi - Government, U Ngan Sak - Chin Democracy League Party, Colonel Kyaw Soe Oo - Tatmadaw, U Thein Swe - Parliament, U Aye Min - Dawei National PartyColonel Zaw Win Tun - Tatmadaw U, U Zaw Htay - Participant, Khum Soe Myint - Pa-oh National Party, Colonel Nay Linn Tun - Tatmadaw, U Khet Htein Nan - Ethnic representativeState Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will deliver closing remarks of the conference, which will close the first session of the Union Peace Conference.

Gro Harlem Brundtland, deputy Chair of The Elders who visited Myanmar in 2014, wrote:“The basic rights of all Myanmar’s people regardless of race, religion or citizenship should be a guiding principle as the country charts its way to a fully democratic and peaceful future. We hope that all parties to the Union Peace Conference hold firm to this principle and engage in its proceedings in good faith.”The Elders also welcomed the appointment of Kofi Annan, who is also a member of The Elders, as the chairman of an advisory commission on Rakhine State.

We've got notes for you on the opening addresses by State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Kachin Independence Organization Maj Gen N’ Ban La, and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's address at the 21st-Century Panglong Conference in Nay Pyi Taw [as delivered - download a transcript in Myanmar-language here]: I give you my full respect and greetings from the United Nations. It is a great honour for me as Secretary-General of the United Nations to address the great opening of the 21st Century Panglong Conference. Thank you for your invitation.This is a historic occasion for the further democratization of this country.The symbolism of this Conference is clear from its title, which recalls the spirit of the original Panglong Conference convened in 1947 by General Aung San, the Father of Modern Burma.But today, we also look to the future.This conference is bringing together Myanmar’s different ethnic groups in a joint commitment to a federal union based on equality, democracy and self-determination.I congratulate all sides for the patience, endurance, determination and spirit of compromise you have demonstrated in support of national reconciliation.There is a long road ahead, but the path is very promising.This is the first time that such a peace process has been initiated in the seventy-year history of conflict and division between the Union Government and armed ethnic groups.Today’s meeting marks a historic transition since former President U Thein Sein opened the doors to democratic reforms six years ago.Around the world, we have seen the tragedies that can ensue when leaders deny the need for democratic change.Myanmar shows what is possible, when leaders listen to their people’s genuine aspirations, genuine concerns of the people and genuine dreams of where this country should proceed.The United Nations has been a steady partner in support of Myanmar’s reforms, in particular the national reconciliation process.We will continue our efforts to smooth differences, lower tensions and move parties towards better understanding and dialogue in line with the goals and values of the United Nations Charter.Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,The long civil war has cost numerous lives and robbed successive generations of their dignity, tranquility and normalcy. It is now clear that there can be no military solution to your differences.I urge you to accept that no party involved in this reconciliation process can expect to achieve all its aims. Conversely, every side must win something if the process is to succeed.This will require goodwill on all sides, and a recognition that success is in the vital interest of all the people of Myanmar, regardless of ethnicity, religion, political affiliation or socio-economic status.It is encouraging that the different ethnic armed organizations with divergent interests and aspirations came together to form a single team to negotiate the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement last year.This agreement was crucially important, and the new Government has undertaken efforts to make it more inclusive. The 21st Century Panglong Conference represents the result of those efforts.I urge all of you, as you walk along this path with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, to demonstrate the wisdom needed to address complex and unresolved issues, and to pave the way for a unified negotiation track that is inclusive of all interests and constituencies.This will require sensitivity and flexibility, and respect for both signatories and non-signatories. You will need to be truly consultative if you are to reach sustainable solutions. In this connection, I urge you again to ensure that women make up at least 30 per cent of the representatives at all levels of dialogue.Distinguished delegates,Every transition [carries] risks.But refusing to embark on transition may carry the greatest risk of all. We see tragic evidence of this around the world.I urge you all to continue to face up to your responsibilities, particularly to the youth and children of Myanmar – the future of this wonderful country.You owe it to them to work for a better tomorrow, in which they can fulfil their dreams and aspirations in peace and prosperity.Ladies and gentlemen,This is my fifth visit to Myanmar as Secretary-General. From Cyclone Nargis in 2008 to the winds of change gripping the country today, I have worked to mobilize the full support of the United Nations system for Myanmar.In my meetings with the authorities and with representatives of the wonderfully diverse people of this country, I have always found inspiration in your determination to advance towards reform, peace and stability.The United Nations will remain your respectful partner as this process deepens.I wish you every success.Let’s work together for peace.Thank you.KIO leader requests peace conference not deviate from ‘Panglong legacy’Lun Min MangThe peace talks must follow in line with the legacy of the historic 1947 Panglong Agreement, the leader of the Kachin Independence Organisation said in his speech today.“The reason why we, the non-Bamar ethnic people, are staging armed revolution is because of the loss of the Panglong Agreement’s guarantees for democracy, national equality and self-determination of ethnic people,” said General N Ban La, head of the United Nationalities Federal Council and vice chair of the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO).The presence of the KIO at the 21st-century Panglong Conference, he said, is meant to be a show of support for the National League for Democracy-backed government following the former opposition party’s sweeping election victory last year.“This is the very first step of the [new administration’s] long-term peace negotiations that will solve decades-long conflicts,” he said.He added that the federal Union that the armed ethnic organisations are demanding is not a request to secede from the Union, but is call for equality for the ethnic nationalities based on the “Union spirit”.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi urges relief for IDPs, peace for future generations Lun Min MangDaw Aung San Suu Kyi urged attendees at the Union Peace Conference to strive for peace for the sake of Myanmar’s displaced peoples as well as its future generations at at the conference opening this morning.In her opening remarks, the state counsellor declared that the country’s ongoing armed conflicts could be solved by “mutual understanding and cooperation” among different parties.She also invoked Myanmar’s independence heroes on the , saying “We should work to achieve peace, keeping in mind the sacrifices of our founding fathers and not forgetting those who suffer from ongoing conflicts, to leave a legacy that will testify to our mercy for future generations.”“The Panglong spirit by which we gained our independence is still needed today to achieve lasting internal peace,” she saidThe state counsellor congratulated former president U Thein Sein for initiating the peace process under the USDP-led administration. President U Thein Sein invited armed ethnic organizations to negotiate with the government in 2013, culminating in the signing of a “nationwide” ceasefire agreement in October, 2015. The pact was widely criticized when only eight groups resolved to sign it, most of them no longer engaged in ongoing hostilities with the government.Though newly-elected USDP chairperson U Than Htay attended thepeace conference, U Thein Sein was not seen in the event this morning. U Than Htay was appointed in a surprise leadership re-shuffle at the USDP party conference earlier this month.The state counselor emphasised in her speech that “more trust has been built” between Myanmar’s political stakeholders at conference if peace talks.“Across the country, people watch with fearful eyes every time there is a peace summit,” she said. “We should not forget that they are suffering.”According to figures from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, about 100,000 people remain displaced by fighting in Kachin and northern Shan States. Some groups in displaced persons camps in Kachin State have been unable to return to their homes for five years.The state counselor also congratulated youth groups who volunteered to staff welcoming events for the conference.“We cannot achieve peace without the participation and investment of every group across the country,” she said.Read the state counsellor's full speech here.Commander-in-Chief warns against “ethnocentric” dialogue at PanglongLun Min MangIn his opening remarks at a conference where ethnic armed groups are pushing for greater autonomy, the Tatmadaw chief stressed the need for “national unification”, and warned away from an “ethnocentric” dialogue.Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing said the Tatmadaw has contributed to the nation-building process “through the ages” and will continue to its utmost ability to achieve peace.“We and our brothers - the armed ethnic organisations - are the ones suffering the most from the internal conflicts. The Tatamdaw will continue to support the peace process based on the three national causes in recognition of peace and stability, national reconciliation and development,” he said.He also pressed all participants to abide by the controversial six “principles for peace”, as outlined for the ethnic armed groups at the beginning of President U Thein’s Sein’s peace process five years ago.The principles, which have been jettisoned by the ethnic armed group leaders, and criticised by analysts as a instituting more of a stumbling block to cooperation than a roadmap to peace, include the demand that ethnic parties and their armed wings adhere to the 2008 junta-drafted constitution. The charter preserves key political roles for the Tatmadaw, including a 25 percent bloc of parliament and an effective veto over future constitutional amendments.“The Tatmadaw’s six peace principles are based on our experience through the years. We should abide by these principles. Different organisations have their own perspectives and policies. But their expectations and the reality will not be the same,” the commander-in-chief said.He encouraged participants to consider what they are able to contribute to the peace process instead of focusing on what they desire from it. He added that all groups should pursue their aims through democratic channels such as parliament. “In this time of democracy we should not forget that we cannot demand what we want through bearing arms and adhering to the principle of armed struggle. Learning from other countries’ experiences, we must work to build our nation collaboratively to the best of our abilities,” he said. Sen Gen Min Aung Hlaing also warned against prolonging the peace process, which he said would create further “frictions”.“We must not lose the trust that has already been built and face the possibility of outside intervention,” he said.“We should have a dialogue for peace without being too ethnocentric,” he added.Read a full copy of the Commander-in-Chief's speech here (English).The Embassy of the United States also released the following statement this morning on the kick-off of the Panglong Conference:""The United States welcomes the opening ceremony on August 31 of the “Union Peace Conference – 21st Century Panglong” and commends all participants for their willingness to engage in an inclusive dialogue for national reconciliation and unity.""Read the entire statement here, or in Myanmar-language here.Analysis: As the Panglong Conference begins, where are the women?  Wednesday, 31 AugustWhile today’s 21st-century Panglong Conference will be recorded on mobile phones and instantly uploaded, attitudes toward gender equality have not advanced so rapidly, and only a tiny number of those delegates involved in the negotiations are women.

Chinese ambassador to Myanmar Hong Liang met with Union Minister for Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement U Win Myat Aye in Nay Pyi Taw yesterday.  “Our country has suffered natural disasters each year because of global climate change and as a consequence of the country’s ecosystem changing, including forest depletion, rivers becoming silted-up, and [the weakening over time of] dams and irrigation canals,” U Win Myat Aye said.“Now China has come to discuss this and told us they will give as much help as they possibly can,” he said.Mr Hong heard about the need for rehabilitation of flood-affected areas, and says China will continue to provide assistance.“Myanmar suffers flooding almost every year. When we investigated the cause of this natural disaster, we found that it concerns river management. During Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s visit [to China last week], the two governments made an agreement that we will cooperate on a management plan for the Ayeyarwady River,” he said.China’s deputy minister of commerce visited Nay Pyi Taw yesterday, and was scheduled to meet with officials to discuss implementation of agreements made between the two countries. During State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s landmark visit to Beijing, China pledged to provide 1 billion yuan, or around US$150 million, for disaster relief.“We will fix causes of this nationwide natural disaster and China said they want to help us in implementing such large-scale projects,” U Win Myat Aye told reporters.Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy in Myanmar and two Chinese companies donated K40 million (US$33,000) to flood victims at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement yesterday.Half of the cash came from the embassy, with the State Power Investment Corporation and Huawei Myanmar also contributing K10 million apiece. The embassy’s money came through donations from staff members, the ambassador said.“China and Myanmar are pauk phaw [brotherhood] friends and it is a good custom to face the disaster together,” said Mr Hong. “Our suffering is equal to Myanmar’s and we want to help Myanmar just like before.”Weather conditions exacerbated by El Niño have caused flooding throughout China this year and relief operations are being carried out, but Myanmar and Chinese citizens are equal, he said.“The donation will support the emergency aid and resettlement operations for flood victims,” said U Win Myat Aye.Translation by San Layy and Zar Zar Soe","/national-news/nay-pyi-taw/22135-china-offers-to-help-myanmar-with-water-management.html"
"155",155,"Interim report from Ayeyarwady dam commission due next month",2016-08-24,"National News","The commission tasked with reviewing and scrutinising hydropower projects along the Ayeyarwady River met for the first time this week, with the recently formed body planning to submit an interim report on its findings next month.           Irrigation expert U Cho Cho, a member of the commission, told The Myanmar Times yesterday that the commission has begun reviewing several reports on matters ranging from environmental impacts to dam designs. It has also requested that the government disclose agreements inked for the projects, including the deal struck between the former military government and a Chinese state-run firm for the controversial Myitsone mega-dam in Kachin State.“The commission cannot rescind the agreements. We can only review the agreements on hydropower projects ... The commission began its duties on August 22,” U Cho Cho said.The commission held two days of meetings this week with all 20 members in attendance.State Counsellor and Foreign Minister Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Chinese leaders discussed the Myitsone hydropower project during her visit to China last week.Responding to questions from reporters following those meetings, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said her government had created the review commission to determine the best way to resolve the impasse over the fate of the Myitsone dam, which was suspended by then-president U Thein Sein in 2011 amid public uproar over the project. She added that she could not yet say what that solution might be and would await the commission’s findings.“This is precisely the duty of the commission – to find out what the best solution is going to be,” said the state counsellor.In its review, the commission has been instructed to determine whether hydropower projects along the country’s main waterway should go forward, bearing in mind costs and benefits to citizens. The commission is to submit its first full report to President U Htin Kyaw by November 11.The commission must also assess contractual arrangements and seek solutions amenable to both Myanmar’s people and foreign investors, as well as collect the opinions of average citizens and civil society organisations.U Cho Cho said the commission’s initial work would not include surveying locals and CSOs, and that this would come “later”.Daw Ja Hkaung of the Kachin State-based Mungchying Rawt Jat organisation, a long-time opponent of the Myitsone project, said the commission needed to analyse all aspects of the dam, adding that the outcome of the review must be accepted by the public.“The commission should be cautious of the people’s desire. If the commission reports that [the project] should continue, the people will be angry not only at the commission but also at the government,” she said.U Aye Thar Aung (Arakan National Party; Rakhine 6), deputy Speaker of the Amyotha Hluttaw, highlighted the Ayeyarwady River’s value to the nation, while noting the difficult spot the government has been put in.“The river is the lifeblood of our country and people don’t want it to be damaged. The people’s wish is to cancel the project. But we need to consider that China is a neighbouring country,” he said.The former military junta and China Power Investment Corporation inked an agreement to construct the US$3.6 billion Myitsone dam in 2006.A relocation program for locals who would be displaced by the dam’s reservoir began in 2009. Two years later the project was suspended, however, with U Thein Sein conceding to an opposition campaign that objected to potential negative environmental impacts and an arrangement that would have seen some 90 percent of the electricity generated sent across the border to power China’s Yunnan province.","/national-news/22119-interim-report-from-ayeyarwady-dam-commission-due-next-month.html"
"156",156,"FM in China with dam project on agenda",2016-08-19,"National News","Foreign Minister Daw Aung San Suu Kyi met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang yesterday as Myanmar seeks to cement ties with Beijing – long the former military junta’s protector.           The five-day visit – with the suspension of a giant Beijing-backed dam project set to dominate talks – is Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s first major foreign trip since her government took over in March after a landslide election victory.That showed that “the Myanmar government and you yourself pay great attention to China-Myanmar ties”, Mr Li told Daw Aung San Suu Kyi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.“China approves of this,” he said, adding, “China and Myanmar are linked by mountains and rivers.”Myanmar sees its giant neighbour – and largest trading partner – as its biggest foreign policy preoccupation.Unfreezing the US$3.6 billion Myitsone dam will be a priority for China, while officials said Daw Aung San Suu Kyi would seek Beijing’s cooperation for talks with armed groups operating near the countries’ shared border.Beijing was instrumental in shielding Myanmar’s former junta rulers from international opprobrium while Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, now state counsellor as well as foreign minister, languished for years under house arrest as a democracy activist.At the time Myitsone was seen as emblematic of China’s economic dominance over Myanmar. In 2011 a quasi-civilian government halted the project in a surprise move after local protests, and Beijing has been pressing for its resumption ever since.“At present there are complex changes in the world,” Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said in Beijing, where she was greeted with military honours.She hoped that relations between the two countries could be “further consolidated and developed”, she added.As well as Mr Li, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is due to hold talks with China’s President Xi Jinping during her trip, which began on August 17.On her first visit to China last year, she faced calls to raise the case of her fellow Nobel laureate Chinese writer Liu Xiaobo – sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2009 for circulating a petition calling for democratic reforms – but did not do so.Beijing staunchly objects to foreign leaders criticising its rights record, and few expect her to do so this time.Analysts said the choice of China for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s first trip to a major foreign capital shows the relationship is a priority after Myanmar’s historic November election saw a landslide vote to end military-backed political domination.With a total of $15.4 billion of approved investments in Myanmar, China is by far its largest foreign investor, despite reforms in recent years that have seen Western firms surge back.Its interests range from a huge oil and gas pipeline and special economic zone to dams and mining. Chinese firms have continued to win major contracts in recent months.But Myanmar has drawn closer to the US during its transition to civilian rule.At the same time Myanmar needs to get Beijing onside as it pursues historic peace talks with armed groups who cross over the border into China to find sanctuary and to trade in illicit items.Fighting in the border region of Kokang between the Myanmar army and local rebels has seen residents flee into China, and shells occasionally landing on its territory, straining relations.“We are prepared to discuss it [about peace] if they would discuss,” U Kyaw Zeya, director general at Myanmar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told AFP earlier.Communist-ruled China launched a diplomatic charm offensive after the November election, dispatching Foreign Minister Wang Yi for talks with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi soon after her party’s victory.China’s state-run media sought to portray the current trip as a sign that Myanmar’s ties with Beijing are stronger than its links to Washington.“Contrary to the subjective view that a democratic Myanmar will lean toward the West, Suu Kyi’s visit to China carries significant weight,” commentator Wang Wenwen wrote in the Global Times newspaper.Several commentators said Chinese investment was still essential for Myanmar, but signalled that Beijing might be willing to make concessions on dam projects by consulting more with locals.Researcher Song Qingrun wrote in the China Daily that “China should make sure local residents approve of the location and size of the hydroelectric stations, and the environmental assessments pass public scrutiny”.– AFP","/national-news/22040-fm-in-china-with-dam-project-on-agenda.html"
"157",157,"Myitsone looms large ahead of China meet",2016-08-16,"National News","China-backed developments are expected to loom large during Foreign Minister Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s upcoming visit to China, as many anticipate striking a deal on the suspended Myitsone dam project will be the order of the day.          Political analyst U Than Soe Naing believes Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will be under pressure to reach a resolution on the controversial mega-dam.“I think that the [National League for Democracy] government has no solution for the Myitsone dam, and they have no prospect for compensation. China will ask her about the Myitsone dam during her trip. She cannot avoid [it],” he said.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been a vocal opponent of the Myitsone project. In 2011, she penned a personal appeal calling for a mutually agreeable resolution. The missive has gone viral on Facebook in Myanmar in recent days, ahead of the landmark China trip which starts tomorow.“While recognising that large sums of money have already been spent on the realisation of the project, we would urge that in the interests of both national and international harmony, concerned parties should reassess the scheme and cooperate to find solutions that would prevent undesirable consequences and thus allay the fears of all who are anxious to protect the Ayeyarwady [River],” the letter reads.The Myitsone dam project was suspended in 2011 by then-president U Thein Sein.The proposed US$3.6 billion, 4600-megawatt hydropower facility on the Ayeyarwady River was the result of a deal between the previous military government and China Power Investment (CPI).In 2009, Myanmar and China concluded a hydropower cooperation framework agreement, in which both parties supported CPI’s investment and development.CPI indicated that then-prime minister General Soe Win had been the one who invited them in 2006 to invest in Myanmar’s development by building the dam.In 2009, CPI – now Upstream Ayeyarwaddy Confluence Basin Hydropower Company – set up a new village in 2009 to relocate the residents from the hydropower project area.Daw Ja Hkaung of the Mungchying Rawt Jat organisation in Kachin State, a veteran opponent of the Myitsone project, said that the MRJ hopes the foreign minister’s discussions in China will lead to a favourable outcome.“We don’t want to continue the project [nor do most citizens]. The government needs to reconsider the best thing for the Ayeyarwaddy River,” she said.The government last week announced it would form a commission for reviewing and scrutinising hydropower projects along the Ayeyarwaddy. Following yesterday’s parliamentary session, commission chair and Pyithu Hluttaw Deputy Speaker U T Khun Myat told reporters not to worry about the project.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang remarked at a press conference yesterday that Chinese leaders intend to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of common interest.In remarks issued on China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, Mr Lu was quoted as saying bilateral relations are in a state of growth, and that it is thus of great importance to promote a comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation.“It is believed that the visit will help enhance strategic communication, deepen pragmatic cooperation, increase amity among the people, further advance the bilateral relationship and deliver more benefits to people from both sides,” he said.Former MP and political columnist U Ye Tun says he doubts Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will back down from her previously stated position on the Myitsone matter, but says negotiations will require significant political finesse. He pointed to the formation of a special commission on the Myitsone dam as a show of goodwill toward China – and a means of buying time.“Her trip could end without any agreement,” he said.","/national-news/21981-myitsone-looms-large-ahead-of-china-meet.html"
"158",158,"Hydropower projects in Kachin to be reviewed",2016-08-15,"National News","On the eve of a visit to China by Foreign Minister Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, President U Htin Kyaw has announced the creation of a commission to look into the country’s hydropower projects, including the controversial Myitsone dam on the Ayeyarwady River in Kachin State.           According to the announcement released on August 12, the 20-member commission will review and scrutinise the projects to assess the likely benefits for Myanmar citizens, and to make recommendations on whether they should proceed.The Myitsone dam, a major Chinese project, was suspended for the remainder of his term of office by then-president U Thein Sein in 2011. Though his decision was criticised in China, it was widely welcomed in Myanmar, including by local residents, who had complained of land grabs and the relocation of villages.Deputy Pyithu Hluttaw Speaker U T Khun Myat will chair the commission, and the minister for the Office of the State Counsellor, U Kyaw Tint Swe, will serve as vice chair. The commission must consult citizens and civil society organisations in reviewing the contracts from the point of view of expected benefits for both Myanmar citizens and foreign investors. Its first report to the president is due on November 11.Local residents have often vocally opposed hydropower plants on the Aye­yarwady River, and the Myitsone dam is a particular object of their anger.The former military regime invited a Chinese company to build the 4600-megawatt Myitsone dam in 2006. China Power Investment, now renamed Upstream Ayeyarwady Confluence Basin Hydropower (ACHC), built a new village in 2009 to accommodate residents relocated from Tan Hpre, Pa Tan and Myitsone villages.Daw Ja Hkaung, a member of the Mungchying Rawt Jat organisation in Kachin State, a veteran opponent of the Myitsone project, said they would monitor the commission’s work and advise it to recommend that the project should be abandoned.“The situation will be bad if the commission recommends continuing the projects. We don’t want them. We will monitor the commission’s meetings with citizens and CSOs to make sure the results are not faked,” she said, echoing the content of an open letter the organisation had sent to the president in May.Environmental specialist U Win Myo Thu, director of EcoDev Myanmar, told The Myanmar Times that the formation of the commission was a step in the right direction. He said he hoped it would result in changes for the hydropower projects.“I also hope the commission advises against continuing the projects,” he said.ACHC released a statement on August 13 welcoming the commission and saying that it would help the public learn the truth of the projects.“During the implementation of the Ayeyarwady Hydropower Projects, the company conducted project construction activities strictly in accordance with Myanmar law and relevant contractual agreements,” said the statement.The statement said the company would continue to abide by the laws and covenants, practise corporate social responsibility and offer the commission its full cooperation.Foreign Minister Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will visit China from August 17 to 20.","/national-news/21942-hydropower-projects-in-kachin-to-be-reviewed.html"
"159",159,"Township takes on military-run sulphuric acid factory",2016-07-21,"Business","A township committee has refused to renew the operating licence for a military conglomerate-owned acid factory that civil society groups say is damaging local villagers’ health. But regional officials are unsure whether this will be enough to stop the plant operating.           The factory was built “dangerously close” to Kankone village in Sagaing Region’s Salingyi township, where residents have long reported respiratory, skin and eye problems because of factory emissions, an Amnesty International report released yesterday said.Military conglomerate Union of Myanmar Economic Holding Limited (UMEHL) built the Moe Gyo Sulphuric Acid Factory in 2007 to serve two copper mines – Letpadaung and the Sabetaung and Kyisintaung mine. UMEHL operates these in partnership with Chinese firm Wanbao Mining Company.In May, a factory representative approached U Ko Ko Naing, the recently elected chair of the new Salingyi township development committee, and asked him to renew the factory’s licence, U Ko Ko Naing told The Myanmar Times.The township committee extension requires a raft of documentation including environmental and health certification from village officials, which were not forthcoming, he said. The factory representative approached U Ko Ko Naing at the beginning and again at the end of May, but was refused the extension on both occasions, he added.U Ko Ko Naing did not comment on why certification was not given, but local resident U Aung Soe said local officials had refused to give their approval. The village is constantly fighting pollution from the factory, which had recently forced a local school to close, he added.Villagers have railed against the factory and the Letpadaung mine for years through often bloody protests – in an infamous response to a 2012 demonstration police used white phosphorous that left many protesters with burns.The mine restarted operations on May 5 to widespread protests from villagers, who demanded that the conclusions of a 2013 parliamentary inquiry – recommending the project continue only with better transparency and an environmental impact plan – be formally adopted.Sagaing Region MP U Thein Naing said he was aware that U Ko Ko Naing had not extended the factory’s licence, but was unsure of what the outcome would be. Municipal law requires township committee approval for the operating licence, but the authorities would likely take into account both the “foreign investment situation” as well as local law, he said.The factory is operating with permission from the Ministry of Industry under an initial three-year test run, which expires in October, U Ko Ko Naing said. UMEHL only obtained permission to operate the factory in 2013, after the parliamentary inquiry led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi found that it had been built without permission from local authorities, according to Amnesty International.A local official told Amnesty International that the Directorate of Industrial Supervision and Inspection – a body under the Ministry of Industry – was allowing the factory to run, even though it lacked a licence from the township committee.U Than Htay, a spokesperson for Sagaing Region Chief Minister U Than Htay, said the Sagaing government would like to relocate the factory away from the village, but that it had no power to either stop it operating or relocate the plant.That was a decision for the Union government, he said, because the licence to operate the factory had been granted by the then-Ministry of Mines – now the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation.U Win Htein, director general of the Department of Mines, told The Myanmar Times that the permit to build the factory had been granted by the Ministry of Industry. But he suggested the factory’s operations are covered by the licence it has to operate the Letpadaung mine.U Win Htein added that the Sagaing Region government has the power to stop the factory on environmental grounds, but that it would need to collect detailed evidence from qualified environmentalists and submit the request to the government.Amnesty International business and human rights researcher Mark Dummett, who visited Sagaing in June, said the township council has been in touch with members of civil society group the Myanmar Alliance for Transparency and Accountability (MATA) and wants an environmental assessment.A MATA spokesperson told The Myanmar Times the organisation is helping Salingyi township representatives put together a presentation on the environmental damage the factory is causing, which will be presented to the upper and lower houses of parliament later this month. Sagaing Region MP U Thein Naing said it would be difficult to prove environmental damage without the means to accurately measure air pollution.A UMEHL spokesperson said yesterday he did not have time to comment, while Wanbao could not immediately be reached for comment.","/business/21504-township-takes-on-military-run-sulphuric-acid-factory.html"
"160",160,"High hopes for deserted trading town on Myanmar-China border ",2016-07-21,"Business","Last year, it was a ghost town. Racked by the fighting around Laukkai, Chinshwehaw’s once-booming economy, built on its location as a major trading camp on the border with China, had collapsed as workers fled and shops closed down.           Fighting between the Tatmadaw and the Myanmar National Democractic Alliance Army (MNDAA) broke out in early 2015, driving away the masons and the sugar-cane workers who had come from all over Myanmar to work for mainly Chinese business owners.But now, though the government’s efforts to end armed conflict through the 21st-Century Panglong Conference have barely begun, prosperity, if not yet a stable peace, seems to have returned to the town, in northeastern Shan State’s troubled Kokang region.For the long term, the border post is a vital node in China’s plan for a four-nation China-Myanmar-Bangladesh-India trade route.Progress toward this goal is already under way on the Chinese side of the border, where an economic cooperation zone is being built at nearby Lincang, according to U Thaung Lwin, a director at the Chinshwehaw trading zone.He told The Myanmar Times that Myanmar and China have also discussed another border trading zone in Shan State’s Mine Ton/Mong Ton township.Either of the two new projects has the potential to rival the border post at Muse, across from Ruili in Yunnan province, which is currently Myanmar’s busiest trading point, he said, though this depends on investment into trading infrastructure.“China sees Chinshwehaw as a portal for importing food and other goods from Myanmar. Once the economic cooperation zone is finished, exports passing through Chinshwehaw will match those of Muse,” he said, adding that Myanmar traders are mostly interested in exporting, rather than importing.The trading zone at Lincang-Chinshwehaw will be a link in a vast chain that will connect South and Southeast Asia with the Pacific, a process already under way with the completion of a road between Lincang and Kunming.A parallel railway between Kunming, Chinshwehaw and Kyaukphyu in Myanmar’s Rakhine State was suspended by Myanmar’s previous government, but the Kunming-Lincang stretch of the railway is already in place, and a Lincang-Chinshwehaw rail connection is under construction, with a completion deadline of 2020.Construction of a new bridge in Shan State’s Kunlong, across the Thanlwin River, started earlier this year and is expected to be completed next year, while a new airport is also planned for the area.Chinshwehaw border post is now the country’s third-largest in terms of import-export trade volume.Agricultural and fisheries produce such as beans, corn, sesame and eels are exported to China through the gate, which yields about US$50 million a month in proceeds on average.In the 2016-17 financial year so far, Muse has processed about US$1.135 billion in trade. Myanmar’s second-busiest border post is between Myawady and Mae Sot in Thailand, which has seen more than $206 million in trade this year while Chinshwehaw has processed around $144 million, according to Ministry of Commerce data.Translation by Thiri Min Htun","/business/21499-high-hopes-for-deserted-trading-town-on-myanmar-china-border.html"
"161",161,"Ayeyarwady minister backs Maubin industrial zone",2016-07-14,"Business","The Ayeyarwady Region minister for planning and finance has re-sent blueprints for a 300-acre industrial zone in Maubin township to the Union government.          Regional officials approved the zone in 2014, but it was shelved by the central government because the land is designated as farmland, which means it cannot be used for any other purpose.U Hla Kyaw told The Myanmar Times the zone would create job opportunities and improve living standards in a region that relies heavily on farming.“We have just submitted the project again. We want the Union government to look specifically at issues including electricity supply and the land designation,” the region’s planning and finance minister said.“We want to get the process going again, and hope that the zone can be built in the long term, though many more rounds of approvals are needed before [the project] can begin.”Maubin Development Public Company, a farmer’s cooperative formed in 2014 with 134 shareholders, would put up 30 percent of the US$246 million investment, said the company’s general manager U Aung Kyaw Min.Chinese firm Shanghai-Yuandong would invest 55pc and Myanmar-registered Southern Metal would pay 15pc, he said.He said the project was shelved two years ago because the government was unable or unwilling to change the land from farmland to industrial land.“All 283 acres are farmland, bought from farmers,” he said, adding that his company is ready to start work.“We have already discussed the project with international investors. For the infrastructure such as drains, water supply, electricity and roads, we will split the costs according to our share in the project.”He hopes to encourage investment from sectors including garments, food and beverage, consumer products, literature, and electronics.“In total we will have space for 50 factories and will be able to create jobs for 77,000 local people,” he said.Finished products can be shipped along the Ayeyarwady River to Yangon and electricity can be supplied from nearby Kyaiklat, he added.“Our project is an interesting proposal for foreign companies that want to invest in Myanmar.”Translation by Khant Lin Oo","/business/21376-ayeyarwady-minister-backs-maubin-industrial-zone.html"
"162",162,"It’s not all doom and gloom in Southeast Asia",2016-07-08,"Opinion","Wherever you look, the American media seems to be decrying Southeast Asia’s political retrogression. According to the headlines, there’s “no end in sight” to the junta in Thailand, “religious tyranny” is on the rise in Malaysia, Filipinos live in fear of their new president and Indonesia is itching to execute foreigners.           These stories aren’t entirely wrong and they certainly point to a number of serious challenges for the region’s democrats. The problem is that the litany of bad news gives one the impression that democracy in Southeast Asia must be in free-fall. In fact, this is not the case.The sheer volume of negative press – as well as increased criticism from the think-tank world – is a side effect of Washington’s newfound obsession with Southeast Asia. It is the United States’ increased attention to the region (the so-called “pivot to Asia”) that is making commentators more aware of its shortcomings. And as Southeast Asian regimes face greater scrutiny, their imperfections are thrust into the media spotlight. As a result, even seasoned observers – not to mention casual readers – may fail to pay sufficient attention to the underlying trends, which are overwhelmingly positive.It’s no surprise that the pivot has attracted the backing of some within the American government who would like to contain China. Washington fears it is losing sway to Beijing, which is carrying out a massive investment campaign across Southeast Asia and is even building new islands in the South China Sea. India and Japan, both of which tend to see China as a rival, are the United States’ natural allies in this effort. The Southeast Asian countries, on the other hand, occupy a more ambiguous position. Their inhabitants find themselves balancing strong economic and geographical ties with China against a longing for closer association with the West.Thinktanks and human rights groups are keen to highlight the region’s political regression and persecution of dissidents. Major publications describe it as politically unstable, in democratic recession and ridden with dictators. But we should treat such wholesale condemnation carefully, as it is often exaggerated and driven more by increased scrutiny than by facts on the ground.The increased focus on Southeast Asia’s problems creates a tendency to overlook its long-term positive advances. In fact, the region is much more stable and democratic now than it was just 30 years ago. Back then, Myanmar and the Philippines were led, respectively, by a junta and a dictator. Indonesia was ruled by a military regime that was carrying out a violent occupation of neighbouring East Timor. Further north in mainland Southeast Asia, Vietnam – which had not yet normalised relations with the United States – was propping up a proxy government in war-torn Cambodia.Since then, the region has seen a host of improvements. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has emerged from more than 50 years of military misrule and brought a party led by a Nobel prize-winning dissident into power. Indonesia and the Philippines have held several rounds of democratic elections after decades of ruthless dictatorship. And East Timor has held two national elections since its independence in 2002, emerging as a promising democracy.International indices confirm that, viewed over the longer term, the region has advanced. According to Freedom House, Southeast Asian countries have generally improved in terms of civil liberties and political rights since 1972. Similarly, the Polity IV research project indicates that the region’s democracy rankings have trended upward over the last 30 years.And, despite setbacks in several countries – particularly Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand – there’s no reason to believe the positive developments described above are over. As standards of living across the region improve – and they have dramatically over the last few decades – its growing middle classes will continue to demand more meaningful political participation.It is in this context that we must understand news reports about Southeast Asia’s democratic setbacks. Otherwise, the stream of bad news risks obscuring the region’s long-term gains. This can be especially detrimental when it affects US foreign policy – leading, for example, to excessive criticism that may only drive the region’s governments into the arms of China. It’s a pretty obvious choice: When two superpowers are competing to win you over, why not go with Beijing, the one that refrains from hassling you over your democratic shortcomings?Nowhere is this tension more obvious than in the case of Thailand. Washington has repeatedly reproached the generals in Bangkok since the 2014 coup, while Beijing has offered to sell them military hardware and to invest in large infrastructure projects. Unsurprisingly, Thailand has chosen to shift its allegiance toward the Chinese. Thai leaders are understandably miffed; their country has gone through more than a dozen coups in its modern history, but none has affected bilateral relations with the United States as severely as this one. Now the fact that the Thais are cozying up to Beijing is exacerbating the harsh reaction from Washington.Despite the political setbacks in some countries, strategic thinkers in the US government are betting that, in the long run, authoritarian regimes will ultimately choose to side with the liberal order. According to this view, we should be careful not to overestimate the impact of democratic shortcomings, which aren’t representative of the region’s overall political direction.The stress on Southeast Asia’s political regression is fuelled less by what is happening in the region than by developments in the United States. Americans need to pursue a smart foreign policy that is not based on a Manichean worldview that sees the world in terms of “good” and “bad” states. Instead, we need a more nuanced understanding of the area’s political trends.This is not to say Southeast Asia does not have serious problems worth debating. Of course it does. But let’s avoid exaggerating them, and remember instead how far the countries of the region have advanced. Southeast Asia isn’t going to hell in a handbasket. Don’t be duped into thinking so.–The Washington Post","/opinion/21281-it-s-not-all-doom-and-gloom-in-southeast-asia.html"
"163",163,"Free from sanctions, state-owned MFTB upgrades services",2016-07-08,"Business","One of three state-owned financial institutions recently taken off the US sanctions list says it has made a concerted effort to upgrade its services since the current government took power in April, under instruction from the Ministry of Planning and Finance.           Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, established in 1976, held a monopoly on the foreign exchange market and trade financing for many years, but when the market was liberalised in 2012 the archaic state bank quickly lost market share to more competitive and efficient commercial lenders.As part of the new finance ministry’s 100-day plan, MFTB was asked to offer new services and remove restrictive policies, said deputy general manager Daw Myint Myint Maw in an interview with The Myanmar Times.While the bank is among the best-known in the country with more than 100,000 account holders, it has just a single branch in Yangon, where it has now opened an information desk for customers.For years under the former government even the smallest customer request had to be approved by a managing director, but since April decision-making power has been extended to manager level, said Daw Myint Myint Maw. This has significantly improved efficiency – requests that previously took three days to process can now be approved in half a day.Customers are also now able to open current accounts, where they can deposit kyat. Traders can also make payments for imports in kyat, at a rate set by the bank, a change which should reduce the currency exchange risk for customers, Daw Myint Myint Maw said.“This is to protect against currency volatility and reduce the difficulties [for the customer] of buying massive amounts of US dollars,” she said.Until recently, MFTB was run almost entirely manually, which meant that importers and exporters had to visit the bank in person each time they wanted to make or receive a payment. As individual withdrawals were often limited to $10,000, it could take between 10 and 15 working days to take out enough money to pay for a shipment of imports.In May, at the request of the finance ministry, the bank opened its first cash point. Located in Yangon International Airport, this is the first multi-currency ATM in Myanmar, Daw Myint Myint Maw said. In addition to cash withdrawal services, customers can insert US dollars and other currencies into the machine and receive kyat in return.The bank has no plan to open other ATMs, as it has no other branches, she added, but has started issuing debit cards which can be used to withdraw money from machines operated by other banks.A decision by the US Treasury in May to remove MFTB from its list of Specially Designated Nationals means that the bank can now handle US dollars freely. Two other state lenders, Myanma Economic Bank and Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank, were removed from the list at the same time.All three banks have been using euros and other international currencies instead of US dollars for trade payments for more than a decade since sanctions were imposed in 2003.“As soon as sanctions were removed, many of our old customers came back to us and opened new accounts,” said Daw Myint Myint Maw.Senior officials are also starting to reach out to US banks more than a decade after their relationships were when sanctions were imposed on Myanmar. MFTB is also in discussions with Singapore’s Oversea Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), which may provide help to upgrade their services, Daw Myint Myint Maw said, though declined to provide further information.As commercial banks have improved their services and adapted quickly to increased competition with the help of foreign banks, which entered the market in 2014, Myanmar’s four state lenders have largely been been left behind.The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have advised the government on options for modernisation through policy reform or mergers, but progress has been slow.New banking laws will set the bar higher than it has ever been for financial institutions in Myanmar and while MFTB has raised its paid-up capital to K20 billion in line with the new rules, it will struggle to meet new reserve ratio requirements – the percentage of a bank’s deposits that it must hold on to and not lend out, said Daw Myint Myint Maw.Responding to accusations by commercial lenders that state banks have been unwilling to participate in the interbank foreign exchange market, and have been hoarding US dollars, she said the bank needs its reserves in order to ensure timely payments to foreign partner banks.“The Central Bank has urged us to sell our US dollars to them at their daily auctions in the past, and we have obliged, but the Central Bank is unable to fulfil our [foreign currency] requirements when we need it,” she said, adding that the Central Bank only returns around 10pc of the US dollars it is sold.“The other difficulty is that we have to pay US dollars to foreign banks even though our importers are paying by kyat,” she said.This article has been updated to reflect Myanma Foreign Trade Bank's correct founding date. The bank was established in 1976, not 1963.","/business/21284-free-from-sanctions-state-owned-mftb-upgrades-services.html"
"164",164,"Chapter 11: Come into my Parlor",2016-07-07,"","I’ve been hearing some very strange things about Tough Eddie Htoo Htoo lately,” said my contact on The Myanmar Times, crime reporter Zone Lone.          “Like?”“Like he wants to go legit. Being an old-fashioned crime boss, even a very rich and successful one, isn’t enough for him anymore. He hankers after social acceptance.”“Go on.”“He had his teeth done. After years of chewing betel, nobody was redder in tooth and claw than Eddie. Now, when he smiles, he channels Liberace. The effect is no less chilling, I’m told.”“What else?”“Weird stuff. Bits and pieces, but it all points in the same direction. He opened a florists’ shop called Eulalia. He was seen at the Southwest New City Opera House, in white tie and tails. And a top hat. And then at a Shakespeare performance at the SNC Theater. OK, Coriolanus, but still. He’s been heard attempting to speak English, with mixed results, but nobody laughs. He even, get this, has been seen crooking his little pinkie finger when he drinks tea. Now that has to mean something.”“So what does it mean?”“Eddie wants to put his violent criminal past behind him and join the great and the good. And he’s obviously being carefully coached by someone who knows exactly what they’re doing. Tough Eddie wants to get out of Southwest New City. He wants to cross the Hlaing River and make it in the mainstream. In Yangon Old City.”What had all this to do with me?Driving back into SNC with Daw Mae East and going over in my mind what had happened that night at the Blue Moon Kachin restaurant, I couldn’t help wondering if I was putting my head into a noose. I had watched from five feet away as Tough Eddie Htoo Htoo coldly gunned down two men at the next table.My mind was working furiously. I knew now, as I had not known then, that the humorous-looking Chinese guy he shot was Laughing Chow, the gang boss of Southwest New City, at least until that night, when Eddie blew his head off. The silver-haired man was SNC Police Commander “Nipper” Nyunt, brought along by Laughing Chow as a guarantor of good behavior by all concerned. Nice try. But the lank-haired, blank-faced kid who shot them both, with a gun he’d had stashed in the toilet, didn’t do good behavior.I also know now, which I did not know that night, that while he was busy shooting his main competitor and his police protector, the kid had sent his men out into the gin joints and gambling halls and cellar bars of Southwest New City to massacre Laughing Chow’s men. Every single one. By the next morning’s blood-soaked dawn, the kid was the new master of Southwest New City.That was Eddie. No wonder they called him Tough Eddie Htoo Htoo.Rumor had it that in the days and weeks that followed the Blue Moon massacres, Eddie Htoo Htoo had consolidated his power, extracting tribute from the bar and casino and dance-hall owners, making nice with City Hall and even managing to set things straight with the police.Like I said, Southwest New City police are different than police in the rest of the city. Across the Hlaing River, they have their own ways of doing things. One gnarled police lieutenant in Twante once told me, “You want honest cops and unbribable public officials? Try the pantywaists over at Northeast New City. SNC was crooked before it was born.”Daw Mae East sat beside me silently as I negotiated the early evening traffic heading for the bridge. I wondered again what she really wanted of me, and why I had decided to accompany her back to SNC despite the fact that her story didn’t add up. She was offering too much, explaining too little. Her story about a no-good husband squandering her investment in their tattoo parlor was not the business of a private eye. Why did she really want me to go back with her to Southwest New City?As we approached the bridge, with the lights of SNC’s towers blazing in front of us, another detail of that deadly night at the Blue Moon suddenly occurred to me, something I noticed at the time, but then forgot. I didn’t think it was important.I was wrong.I replayed in my mind the events of that evening. The three men at the wooden table, the food and the wine, the way Laughing Chow had kept laughing until the moment the kid blew his head off. I thought of the acrid cloud of blue gun smoke that had hung in the air after the executions, the way it drowned out the cooking smells. Then I remembered something else.Icy fingers seemed to walk down my spine.There had been another scent in the air, briefly, before the gunplay began. I forced myself to go over the scene in my mind one more time, resisting the temptation to skip over the details to get to the shooting part.Now I had it. When he hauled the black snub-nosed pistol out of the waistband of his longyi, something else had come out with it. A scrap of lace, a lady’s handkerchief. For the briefest of instants, a scent had wafted toward me, before the bullets started flying and two men lay dead.A fruity yet fugitive scent redolent of mango trees in the morning in the rain, underscored with a darker, earthier heft, the musk of loamy fields fragrant with poppies nurtured with cow-dung. Both robust and refined, elegant and full-bodied, it was a perfume unashamed of its rustic roots.Eau de Kachin.And now I was smelling again that same scent, worn by the woman sitting beside me.Next Week: A Tight CornerYe Mon Chan Dala","/lifestyle/fiction/lady-don-t-fall-backwards/21272-chapter-11-come-into-my-parlor.html"
"165",165,"Cathay United Bank eyes green finance",2016-07-01,"Business","Taiwan-based Cathay United Bank is ready to make a third attempt to get a licence to operate in Myanmar – by offering to fund green energy projects. CUB, which opened a representative office in Yangon in 2014, says it will seek local partners in such ventures if it gets the licence.           An initial round of nine foreign lenders that won branch licences in 2014 was joined by a second round of four earlier this year. Taiwanese banks dominated applications in that second round, with CUB one of eight lenders from the country to respond to a request for proposals. The firm had also applied during the first round.“When we first applied, it was mainly Chinese and Japanese banks that received licences. We applied again in March this year, without result. If CBM invites us to apply a third time, we will do so,” said Paul Lin, a vice president at the bank.Mr Lin is hoping that if given a licence the bank will be able to expand into green finance, “especially for solar power plants”, he said.Foreign firms have already invested in solar energy in Myanmar. In August 2014, US-based private equity fund ACO Investment Group signed with the ministry to develop two 150MW solar plants near Mandalay at a cost of $480 million.Thailand’s Green Earth Power Company signed an agreement with the government several months later in October 2014, to spend $350 million on a 220MW solar power station, on 850 acres near to Minbu in Magwe Region.CUB is known in Taiwan for its expertise in green finance and green power projects and has expanded the model into China, Japan and the United States, Mr Lin said. CUB has provided loans to 1000 projects, “totalling over 216MW in solar power capacity,” he added.“Our company has done considerable research into green power projects and we will implement them in Myanmar if we receive a government licence to open an office here. We are also looking for local partners and investors to implement such projects, and we will cooperate with any local banks that are interested in carrying them out,” he said.Since opening an office in 2014, CUB has disbursed inter-bank loans to local banks to support local SMEs. The bank has also offered training to Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) staff and employees in private banks, said Mr Lin.“The banking industry in Myanmar now is similar to what it was in Taiwan 40 years ago. We have experience in this kind of environment and would like to share our experience through training to staff. We will make proposals to CBM,” he said.","/business/21159-cathay-united-bank-eyes-green-finance.html"
"166",166,"The Lady and a junta, Thai-style",2016-06-22,"Opinion","The visit this week by Nobel Peace Prize laureate and democracy icon Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will certainly brighten the spirits of the sombre Thai people and could also lift the profile of the Thai junta and Myanmar’s top leader.           Yet we shouldn’t romanticise too much about “The Lady” and her capacity as the political realities in Myanmar and Thailand remain daunting. Besides, she is no longer a secular saint but a fully fledged politician.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s three-day visit will include a stop in Mahachai, the seafood hub where she made a rousing speech to thousands of Myanmar labourers four years ago on one of her first trips abroad after years of house arrest.At least 3 million Myanmar migrants work in Thailand, both legally and illegally. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi would like to see many of them return home and contribute to her country’s economy – to the dismay of Thai employers who rely heavily on the workforce from next door.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is expected to thank Thailand for embracing the migrants and to remind the government to take care of their welfare, wages and human rights. She needs to let them know she cares, since they played a significant role in persuading relatives back home to “vote for change” and install the National League for Democracy government last November.Thai democracy lovers and the Myanmar exile community are also curious about what Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will say about human rights in general. Having spoken out for years in support of students, politicians, ethnic groups and others persecuted by the Myanmar military, will she have a good word for those opposing the military strongmen running Thailand? Expect a few vague words of consolation to Thai people about working toward full democracy.Also on her agenda are better border regulation to tackle illicit drugs and human trafficking, and cooperation to develop economic zones in border areas.Thailand has prepared an amendment to a 2003 labour agreement that specified only employment, to include rule of law and other protection aspects. The changes should make recruitment faster and more transparent for employers and more convenient and affordable for Myanmar migrant workers.More effort is also expected to breathe life into the Dawei megaproject. Myanmar wants Japan to invest more in infrastructure there, but Japan wants to see its Thilawa port near Yangon up and running first – even though Dawei will substantially benefit Japanese investment in Thailand and the region.Progress on Dawei could be linked to a solution to the long-running refugee problem. However, this can only materialise if the Myanmar government and armed ethnic groups as well as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are part of the solution.It would be a noble gesture for the leaders of the two countries to propose a pilot project for the voluntary return of refugees to Dawei, where they could contribute to, and benefit from, economic development.The roads to Dawei are the stronghold of the Karen National Union. If a political solution is found, some returnees – from camps in Ratchaburi and Kanchanburi – could be assisted to return to Myitta in Tanintharyi Region, 70 kilometres (43 miles) from the Thai border.But the KNU says any return “must be accorded with safety and dignity”, which includes the clearing of landmines among other conditions. It’s a complicated problem as the refugees have been away from their homes for two or three decades and a lot has changed. Activists say as many as 3000 villages have been destroyed or abandoned due to the actions of armed groups and the Myanmar military.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has so far been vague about ethnic issues. She has announced a new round of peace talks but the ethnic groups feel she has given too many concessions to the military, whose goodwill she needs to maintain.So as a pragmatic politician Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will also avoid discussing issues unpopular among domestic constituents, such as the fate of the long-persecuted Rohingya, with Thailand. The Thai side probably wasn’t going to mention it anyway.Also expect silence on Thanlwin River dam projects, in which both Thai and Chinese players are involved, and which ethnic groups oppose. Continuing such projects at a time of peace-building would be an “opportunistic and exploitative act”, they have said.In short, the political realities on both sides suggest that in the end, the meeting with “The Lady” could be just one more photo opportunity for Thailand’s premier to add to his collection.– Bangkok PostAchara Ashayagachat is a senior reporter on socio-political issues for the Bangkok Post.","/opinion/20987-the-lady-and-a-junta-thai-style.html"
"167",167,"Myitsone developer releases excerpts of contract agreement",2016-06-22,"National News","Amid continued lobbying from China to restart the controversial Myitsone dam, the development company behind the project released excerpts of the contract agreement over the weekend.          In a Myanmar-language statement disseminated through Chinese state mouthpiece Xinhua, China Power Investment Corporation listed a series of alleged benefits for the local people, a bid to sway public opinion in favour of resuming the US$3.6 billion hydropower project.In 2011, then-president U Thein Sein angered the Chinese, but delighted local residents, by ordering the suspension of work on the dam in Kachin State, one of a number of large and controversial projects China is pursuing in Myanmar.Local residents have vehemently protested the project for fear that it will cause degradation to a confluence both historically and environmentally integral to Kachin. The state government earlier this month told the Chinese ambassador that the project won’t be restarted unless the local people agree to back it, while State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly said no decision can be made without reviewing the contract.The company appeared to be making an attempt to address both concerns with the Xinhua statement, which dealt with various issues, including transparency, legal compliance, details of profit-sharing and electricity-sharing, electricity sales, environmental impact, the impact of the proposed reservoir on communities downstream, social responsibility, resettlement, social impact, safety, and social welfare.The statement also threatened legal action against local protesters and unnamed news sources for allegedly defaming the hydropower project.“As for spreading rumours, making false charges and defaming in defiance of the facts, which is being done by a small number of media outlets and organisations, the company will safeguard its legitimate rights and interests by legal means, and we are expecting that the public and media are able to distinguish between truth and falsehood,” the statement said.The Kachin State-based organisation Mungchying Rawt Jat (MRJ), which has objected to the dam, denounced the company statement as “meaningless”.MRJ member Daw Ja Hkaung said the organisation’s opposition did not constitute defamation.“Everybody knows it’s a bad project. They know the disadvantages. This is not defamation,” she said.In 2009, Myanmar and China concluded a hydropower cooperation framework agreement, in which both parties supported the CPI’s investment and development. The Myanmar government, CPI Yunnan International Power Investment Company (CPIYN) and Asia World Company entered into a joint venture agreement to develop the dam.CPI also said that then-prime minister General Soe Win had been the one to invite them in 2006 to invest in Myanmar’s development by building the dam.“During the negotiation process, more than 10 [Myanmar] ministries participated in the negotiations and reviews,” said the company’s statement.It went on to say that according to the details in the contract, “During the project construction and concession operation period, the Myanmar government will obtain a direct economic benefit of US$54 billion by means of taxes, free power and share dividends, while the investor will obtain about $35 billion.”The contract further specifies that the electricity ministry will benefit from project development by holding 15 percent of the shares, CPI said. Much of the controversy over the project, and the public resistance to it, stems from the fact that 90pc of the electricity generated would be transmitted to China.However, one environmental conservation organisation said the money was no substitute for the preservation of the Ayeyarwady River. Daw Dewi Thant Sin of Myanmar Green Network said, “The Chinese have resumed their pressure on the government. But local residents already objected when the Chinese ambassador visited,” she said.On June 3, Chinese ambassador Hong Liang was greeted by protesters in the Kachin capital, Myitkyina.Activists say the proposed reservoir could affect water quality downstream, cause sea water intrusion at the estuary and even increase earthquake risk in a geologically unstable zone.Tian Shanting, cultural counsellor with the Chinese embassy, told The Myanmar Times that the Myitsone dam would be able to resist natural disasters, a claim challenged by local geologists, as well as relieve water scarcity during the dry season.U Thein Sein suspended the project after CPI relocated thousands of villagers beyond the 766 square kilometres to be inundated. But conflict between ethnic Kachin and the military was reportedly exacerbated in 2010 after work began on the project, and clashes in 2011 ended a nearly two-decade ceasefire agreement.Environmentalists are also demanding the release of the full details of the Myitsone agreement, and not just excerpts.U Zaw Htay, a spokesperson for the President’s Office, said no decision had been taken on the release of the documents, and that consideration was still continuing.The National League for Democracy government is coming under heavy pressure from both sides as it mulls a decision on whether or not to resume the project.While Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has argued that it suffers from a lack of planning, she has more recently hedged on questions about the hydropower dam project. After her April meeting with the Chinese foreign minister she told reporters she had not yet read the contract, and so could not say anything definitively.","/national-news/20972-myitsone-developer-releases-excerpts-of-contract-agreement.html"

But she was unable to comment on why Golden City had been listed as a Toener project along with Kanbae Towers and Riverfront Garden.Daphne Teo, chief investment officer at D3 Capital – a major shareholder in UGP – told The Myanmar Times that Toener officials had previously been told in person to remove Golden City from their firm’s website.Yesterday’s statement was the first time Golden City, Golden Land and UGP had addressed the issue publicaly, she said, adding that the source of Toener’s misconception was unclear.UGP had held talks in the past with Toener about collaborating on Myanmar projects, but not Golden City, Ms Teo said.Toener had also rented out some Golden City offices, but after Toener’s use of Golden City on its website Toener was asked to leave, she said.","/business/property-news/20925-golden-city-denies-toener-link.html"

Toener Investment Group and local partner SMI Real Estate will build 13 condominium towers in Hlaing Tharyar, Yangon’s most crowded township and one of its poorest. The luxury project will be close to some of Myanmar’s largest industrial zones and sprawling slum and squatter settlements.The project, known as Riverfront Garden, located along a main road between Bayintnaung and Aung Zaya bridges, will be the first international-standard condominium development on the Hlaing River. Construction is due to begin next month, said sales executive U Nay Htet Bo.The complex will include seven 31-storey buildings, two 23-storey buildings and four 21-storey buildings, to be completed over the next four years, he said.Initially just two towers will be built on 10 acres over the next two years, he said. “We will start with only two buildings. The remaining 11 blocks will be built afterward. Seven of the buildings will face the Hlaing River and the other six will face Pun Hlaing villas.”Pun Hlaing Golf Estate, owned by tycoon Serge Pun, is the only other luxury development in Hlaing Tharyar, a 600-acre gated luxury estate, described by its website as “an exclusive peaceful oasis”.Sales are already open for apartments in Riverfront Garden, which will “become another high-end international community”, according to Toener’s website.“Sales started last weekend, but only for units from the first two towers,” said U Nay Htet Bo. The 1800 apartments range in size from 558 square feet to more than 960 sq ft, with six apartments to each floor. The asking price is K210,000 per square foot depending on the view and floor, he said.Shopping centres, markets, restaurants, a cinema, playground, gym, swimming pool and parking for 2500 cars, 24-hour security, CCTVs, cleaning management and housekeeping will all be provided. A security system will allow residents to access only their own apartments and the public areas, U Nay Htet Bo said.“Riverfront Garden housing will be decorated with design that combines traditional and modern life, and big picture windows for maximum enjoyment of the river views.”Toener Investment hails from China’s Hunan province. Its two main businesses are mining and real estate development, according to its website, and it has projects in more than 10 provinces in China, as well as in Macao and Hong Kong, and more than 70 subsidiaries.It is already building a large residential developments in Yangon’s Yankin township: Kanbae Towers.Kanbae Towers is a joint venture between Toener Investment and Golden Thitsar, which is registered on the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration website under the name of a shareholder named Luo Qiong Qiong.The 2.2-acre project on Kanbe Road was approved by Myanmar Investment Commission in early 2015 and will include three 25-storey buildings, one 21-storey building and a fifth building with 12 floors.

Tian Shanting, cultural counsellor of the Chinese embassy in Yangon, told The Myanmar Times that the dam will not only have positive benefits for the electrification of Myanmar but could act as a source of water while much of the country suffers from dry reservoirs.“Myanmar needs electricity. The current amount generated is insufficient for the country, especially during the summer season when blackouts are common,” he said. “And after the construction process, [the dam] can used as a water supply and can help resolve the water scarcity problem during the summer season.”Daw Ja Hkaung, whose farmland in Tang Hpre village was confiscated due to the dam, scolded the cultural counsellor, and said the enumerated benefits are groundless given that there is no water shortage in Kachin State.“He should know where most of the water scarcity problems occur in our country. His suggestions for restarting the dam are not reasonable,” she said.Much of the controversy over the project, and the public resistance to it, stems from the fact that 90 percent of the electricity generated would betransmitted to China. Other criticism surrounds the dam’s environmental impact and effect on local communities, which then-president U Thein Sein cited when ordering the suspension in 2012.Emboldened by the National League for Democracy’s election victory, China has launched a charm offensive, lobbying hard to restart the project.On June 3, the Chinese ambassador was greeted by protesters in the Kachin capital where he met with state government officials. He was told the project could not be resumed without the support of local residents.The Upstream Ayeyawady Confluence Basin Hydropower Company – the joint venture comprising China Power Investment Corporation, the Ministry of Electric Power and Asia World which is slated to build the dam – announced last month that the suspension of Myitsone is a business issue to be solved through negotiations between countries.“However, due to the sensational publicity in the international community and the deliberate distortion by a few groups with ulterior motives, the issue of suspension has been highly politicized,” the announcement said.","/national-news/20830-china-promotes-myitsone-dam.html"

The new commission will be chaired by Planning and Finance Minister U Kyaw Win. Commerce Minister U Than Myint has been named vice president and U Aung Naing Oo, MIC secretary under the former government, will keep the same position on the new committee. Other members include Attorney General U Tun Tun Oo, as well as permanent secretaries from the commerce, planning and finance, and natural resources and environmental conservation ministries.A retired director of the General Administration Department will also sit on the board, along with two representatives from the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration and one from the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry – the sole private sector representative.Investors have been growing anxious to see a new review committee formed, after the previous body was dissolved at the end of the former government’s term in late March.The MIC usually meets several times a month to consider and approve a small number of investments, but has been out of action for more than 10 weeks.Since the last meeting in March, when an unusually large number of projects were approved, foreign and local companies have submitted around 100 proposals for appraisal.Most are for garment manufacturing and fishery products manufacturing, according to Chinese news agency Xinhua.Policies and rules on investment applications and approvals will be unchanged under the new government, secretary U Aung Naing Oo told The Myanmar Times last week. He could not be reached for comment yesterday.Under the draft Myanmar Investment Law – a merger of the Foreign Investment Law and the Myanmar Citizens Investment Law – the MIC may become independent.

"172",172,"Chinese ambassador pushes for Myitsone dam restart",2016-06-06,"National News","The Chinese ambassador is lobbying Kachin State officials and residents in an attempt to drum up support for restarting the suspended Myitsone dam.           The Chinese-backed mega-project has come up for reconsideration by the new government and is a pivotal test of relations between the two countries.Ambassador Hong Lang met with state government representatives in Myitkyina on June 3 to convince them of the merits of the US$3.6 billion hydropower project. The ambassador also visited relocation sites and met with residents moved beyond the anticipated flood-line into Chinese-built model villages, according to officials in the state government office.U H La Aung, state minister for the environment and natural resources, confirmed the ambassador’s weekend field campaign, and said the state government responded by insisting the wishes of the local people be respected.“We told him that we need to ask the local residents,” he said. “We also have no authority to make a decision on the dam; it will depend on instructions from the Union government.”While State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has penned letters against the project arguing it suffers from a lack of planning, she has more recently hedged on questions about the hydropower dam project. After her April meeting with the Chinese foreign minister she told reporters she had not yet read the contract, and so could not say anything definitively.President’s Office spokesperson U Zaw Htay yesterday told The Myanmar Times he was not aware of a final decision on the dam. “The government is in the process [of] reconsider[ing] the project,” he said.The Myitsone dam – which would flood a confluence of historic importance to ethnic Kachin people – is one of several Chinese-backed projects under review by the new government, including a copper mine in Sagaing Region that was given the green light to relaunch on May 5.Much of the public opposition against the proposed Myitsone dam has focused on the fact that around 90 percent of the power generated would be sent to China. Other criticism includes the dam’s environmental impact and effect on local communities.Residents removed from around the dam have said the remote relocation sites are infertile and the promised food subsidies fell far short of the required amount.The Union Daily quoted Kachin State Chief Minister U Khet Aung on June 4 as saying that if China wants to restart the dam then the ambassador must continue mediating negotiations between the two countries.“He [the ambassador] told us if [our government] failed to resume the project, the two countries’ relationship will be affected,” said U Khet Aung.Dam developer China Power Investment (CPI) has also pushed for a restart, arguing that it did not get a fair opportunity to disseminate information about the dam’s benefits before it was called to a halt by U Thein Sein’s administration in 2011.CPI, which could not be reached for comment yesterday, has also told media that it faced losses after the dam’s suspension. Should the new government choose to terminate the contract, it would have to reimburse the developer for any investments.“If the Myanmar government cancels the project, we can demand compensation. But we don’t think it will be stopped, because this compensation would be a huge amount for the Myanmar government and people,” said ambassador Mr Hong.Myanmar’s military government and the Chinese company cut a deal over the 6000-megawatt dam in 2006. Starting in 2009, CPI began relocating thousands of villagers beyond the 766 square kilometres (almost 190,000 acres) to be inundated. But conflict between ethnic Kachin and the military was reportedly exacerbated in 2010 after work began on the Myitsone project, and clashes in 2011 ended a nearly two-decade ceasefire. Shortly thereafter, U Thein Sein suspended the dam.On June 4, activists and locals protested the Chinese ambassador’s visit. Last month, the residents wrote a letter to President U Htin Kyaw requesting him to resolve the problem by ending the project for good.Daw Ja Hkaung, whose farmland in Tan Hpre village was confiscated since it fell within the flood-line, said locals won’t accept the hydropower dam.“We haven’t gotten any response from the president yet, but we won’t ever accept it [the dam].

The former nine-member commission, made up of ministers, senior officials and businesspeople, was disbanded when the new government took office at the end of March. Since then, no new investments have been approved.Almost 100 proposals – 48 foreign projects and 50 local ventures – are waiting for appraisal by the new commission, Chinese news agency Xinhua reported earlier this week. Most are for garment manufacturing and fishery products manufacturing, the report said.Policies and rules governing investment applications and approvals will remain the same under the new government, even though new MIC members will be appointed, secretary U Aung Naing Oo told The Myanmar Times.“It will not take so long to form the new commission, perhaps within a week or two. So far the format has not been changed. But some details are currently being debated by our seniors so we do not have all the information yet.”Under the draft Myanmar Investment Law – a combination of the Foreign Investment Law and the Myanmar Citizens Investment Law – the MIC may become entirely independent. For now, it answers directly to the President’s Office.Its independence would be welcomed by many. Under the former government some feared that ministers or other government officials on the MIC board may have faced conflicts of interest or the temptation for partiality.In addition to paving the way for MIC independence, the Myanmar Investment Law is expected to ease some restrictions on business and support an increase in foreigninvestment.Until it is passed, some businesses will continue to lose out due to unfair advantages, U Aung Naing Oo told reporters last September. Some of the existing legislation is outdated: guidelines on joint venture companies, for example, are unclear and in critical need of rewriting, he said.However, favourable laws and a transition to democracy may not be enough to bring in more foreign investment – earlier this year the MIC secretary projected investment approvals of around $6 billion a year until 2020, suggesting only a modest potential increase compared with previous years.Approved investment for the 2015-16 fiscal year hit US$9.4 billion – the highest figure since 2010.

"174",174,"The fight for resources in Myanmar’s deep south",2016-05-25,"Business","Tanintharyi Region, the southern tip of Myanmar, abounds with natural resources and the problems associated with them.           Residents in the isolated region face over-mining by foreign companies, the proposed development of a deep-sea port, an oil refinery and a special economic zone, mechanised farming of rubber and palm oil, an illegal trade in timber, overfishing, migration, and coal-fired power plants.All these problems and more are piling up in the in-tray of Chief Minister Daw Lae Lae Maw, the National League for Democracy MP for Thayatchaung township, Dawei district.She spoke to The Myanmar Times in a recent, exclusive interview and identified two main priorities.“I will bring electricity prices down under K100 per unit across the region. I will also bring back two- thirds of our migrant workers,” she said, adding that the region’s natural resources should be used to develop the local economy, not extracted and sold overseas.Tanintharyi is not connected to the national grid – residents and civil society groups have occasionally protested after being forced to pay up to K600 for one unit of electricity, which costs K50 in Yangon.On average, power in Tanintharyi costs K300 per unit, and will only become cheaper if the national grid is extended. The alternative is to buy gas from Thailand.There may be a certain attraction about the idea of a coal-fired power plant in a region notorious for charging the highest electricity prices in the country, but local residents oppose the idea.Protests have already led to the shuttering of one such plant, in the southern city of Kawthoung, because of its impact on the environment.In the chief minister’s scheme of things, the promise of ecotourism is greater than that of coal.“I can’t allow the building of coal-fired plants in my region. Daw Suu [Aung San Suu Kyi] asked me about this before I become chief minister and I told her I was opposed. I would rather try to get financing for gas turbines, as gas is plentiful here,” said Daw Lae Lae Maw.However, the regional government has no authority to block large projects approved by Nay Pyi Taw.“I want the regional government to play a role in deciding on projects in the region and I hope the central government will do nothing to harm the community,” she said.Recently, more than 2400 people from Launglon township in Dawei district wrote to the chief minister about a coal plant under discussions in Yamezu by a Myanmar-Korean joint venture called 24 Hour Mining & Industry Company, asking for clarity on the rules and regulations governing the project.On a quiet stretch of coast just south of Dawei, villagers are protesting a multi-billion-dollar oil refinery to be built by military-run Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited and Chinese developer Guangdong Zhenrong Energy Co.It will be the first oil refinery the commodity-trading company has built and residents say they have been given very little information about the project, though it will dramatically change their lives.Not too far from the refinery, a massive international development is being planned. The Dawei special economic zone will cover 27 square kilometres in its first phase, rising to an eventual 204.5 sq km, according to local activists.Following the relocation of six villages, nearly K243 billion has been spent on compensating residents for the 12,000 hectares of community land included in the zone, though disputes over the amount of compensation and the quality of the land to which former owners have been relocated rumble on.The zone was supposed to bring jobs and spur regional development. But though several major agreements have been signed since 2008, there seems little to show for the past eight years.“Any kind of investment has to take the effects on the local community carefully into account. With this SEZ, the compensation has not been managed systematically. If you relocate someone, you have to create a livelihood there, or how will they survive?” said Daw Lae Lae Maw, adding that Thai companies had shown a different attitude to the problems raised.Ko Lay Lwin, founder of the civil society group the Dawei Development Association, said the Myanmar government had adopted rules and laws that favoured foreign investors over its own people.“Myanmar has excess cheap labour, weak legislation governing environmental impact, outdated laws, and unclear compensation rules. The basic wage is still cheap at US$3.50 a day,” he said.The location of SEZs in Rakhine State and Tanintharyi Region was seen as a way by the previous government to attract migrant workers back home.Ko Lay Lwin said, “The intention was good, but the incentives offered for local labour are terrible. The investors never want local skilled labour. The government has to tackle existing issues before starting up new projects.”Mining projects, too, have pitted local people against powerful companies. Up to 27 mining companies were active in the region last fiscal year, looking for tin, tungsten and gold.According to a regional government newsletter, five big sites covering almost 9175 acres (3670 hectares) and 11 small sites totalling 523 acres (213ha) are operational in Dawei district.In Myeik district there are four big sites (1488ha) and 12 small sites (235ha) and in Kawthoung district, six small sites (71ha) are being mined.Myanmar Pongpipat, Ngwe Tun Tauk and Delco, the biggest operators in Dawei district, face community opposition amid allegations that mining waste is harming the environment and destroying livelihoods.“Nine residents of Myaung Pyo village launched a suit against Myanmar Pongpipat over the Heinda tin nine years ago,” said resident Daw Tin Hla.“But the company didn’t respond. We’ve been asking them to transport their waste elsewhere rather than throwing it in the creek beside the village, killing fish and destroying our crops. The company has paid no compensation.”The residents hope the new government will take action.Meanwhile, Kan Pauk village residents are petitioning the regional government and the Resources and Environment Ministry to deal with the problems they say are caused by Delco.“Delco executives told regional officials they would dig out the creek that had been contaminated and remove the waste. We are waiting to see if they do so,” said Daw Lae Lae Maw.The company says it has launched a program to develop and regenerate the mine site, aiming to improve the environment and provide support to local communities.Daw Lae Lae Maw said mining projects permitted under the previous government would now be scrutinised to ensure compliance with the new mining law and all other existing rules and regulations.","/business/20493-the-fight-for-resources-in-myanmar-s-deep-south.html"

The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) removed seven state-owned enterprises and three state-owned banks from the “Specially designated nationals and blocked persons list” (SDN).“To incentivise further democratic reforms and maintain pressure on targeted individuals and entities and the military, certain sanctions remain in place,” a statement said.OFAC added to the SDN List six companies that are owned 50 percent or more by Steven Law or Asia World Co Ltd associates on the SDN List.“More broadly, these actions demonstrate the Administration’s support for continued political reforms and broad-based economic growth in Burma, while also maintaining sanctions pressure where needed, and providing the private sector with further clarity to effectively engage in Burma,” OFAC said.US officials in Washington, who asked not to be named, said earlier this week that the decision had been taken in line with recommendations from Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Diplomats in Yangon said the civilian-led government wanted to maintain leverage against the Tatmadaw and its crony business associates.In public Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has neither opposed nor supported the continuation of US sanctions since her landslide election victory.US businesses had lobbied for an end to the sanctions, which had been due to expire on May 20, arguing they damage wider US trade and investment beyond targeted companies and individuals. International human rights groups had called for an extension in an attempt to curb human rights abuses by the Tatmadaw.OFAC responded to business pressure by adding a general license “authorizing transactions related to US individuals residing in Burma, extended and expanded an existing general license authorizing trade-related transactions, and updated an existing general license authorizing certain banking services.”The seven delisted state-owned companies were named as: Myanmar Timber Enterprise; Myanmar Pearl Enterprise; Myanmar Gem Enterprise; No. 1 Mining Enterprise; No. 2 Mining Enterprise; No. 3 Mining Enterprise; and Co-Operative Export-Import Enterprise.Three state-owned banks were also taken off the sanctions list: Myanma Economic Bank; Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank; and Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank.“These removals support US foreign policy goals and acknowledge the changing circumstances in Burma. The entities being removed are organized under civilian line ministries or no longer exist,” the US statement said.Six companies identified as owned 50 percent or more by Asia World or Steven Law were named as Asia Mega Link Co, Asia Mega Link Services Co, Pioneer Aerodrome Services Co, Green Asia Services Co, Global World Insurance Co, and Shwe Nar Wah Co.Any property or interests in property of those companies within the US or in possession or control of US persons should be frozen, OFAC said.Search the full SDN list hereThe son of Lo Hsing Han, an infamous drug lord and tycoon known as the “Godfather of Heroin”, Steven Law is one of Myanmar’s best connected cronies. Hailing from Kokang, a restive region on the Chinese border, he has been sanctioned by the US Treasury since 2008. He had close links with the former military junta and runs a business empire spanning from ports and airports, to trade, mining and hydropower projects.“The remaining sanctions on Burmese individuals and entities are primarily intended to target those who obstruct political reform in Burma, commit human rights abuses in Burma, or propagate military trade with North Korea,” OFAC said, noting that it “significantly” eased sanctions against Myanmar over the past four years.A senior Tatmadaw officer, who asked not to be named, said that the US was acting in its national interests.He noted that the US had imposed tough sanctions against China in 1989 after the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square Military but lifted them three years later when Washington realised it gained no benefits.He said the US had maintained sanctions on Myanmar for more than 20 years because the country was of little economic benefit to the US.“It would be better if they had decided to lift the sanctions. But I don’t think it means anything special. We have stayed under sanctions for years, but we did not have negative effects because of them. We can stand on our own. The US is extending the sanctions, giving reasons of human rights, but this reason is not special for us,” the senior officer said.US sanctions include a ban on arms sales and US imports of rubies and jade.A senior US administration official said in retaining most of the sanctions the objective was to “recognise that the transition is not yet complete”. Democracy in Myanmar had not yet been consolidated, and there are entities and individuals that may seek to undo the democratic shift, he said.Myanmar’s military had been helpful during the recent elections, but retains “undue influence” with a quota of parliamentary seats, a vice-president and three ministerial positions, he said.

On one such visit last month The Myanmar Times was among reporters to visit the capital and factories and trading companies in Suzhou and Guangzhou provinces, where officials said they wanted to expand their network of contacts in the region and deepen existing relationships.Officials showed particular interest in the Myitsone hydropower project suspended by the former Myanmar government in 2011.Senior official Lin Dajian said better cooperation in international production capacity was a key objective of China’s One Belt One Road plan to develop overseas markets through mega-infrastructure projects.Ms Lin told The Myanmar Times that China wanted to deepen its already close economic, cultural and diplomatic links with Myanmar as both countries continued to modernise.“China wants to share the fruits of development by helping to improve international production capacity through cooperation. Planning is very important for national development,” she said, citing a feasibility study being conducted by the Chinese government on strengthening rail connections with Thailand.Ms Lin said resumption of the Myitsone hydropower project in Kachin State could be a solution to Myanmar’s energy shortages. But she also suggested that Chinese-Myanmar relations were at stake.“But the project cannot be seen in isolation. Using the river to generate power is very important, but as part of an overall plan. It’s not just about a single project, but about the whole spectrum of Chinese-Myanmar relations,” she said.In March The Myanmar Times was among a nine-member Myanmar media group invited to Beijing where Liu Zhan, director general of State Power Investment Corporation, the Myitsone hydropower project developer, said he was “70 percent positive” that the new government would resume the project. The company proposed meeting with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in May.Tu Jingchang, a Chinese foreign ministry official for Asian affairs, told The Myanmar Times that the recent visit to Nay Pyi Taw of Foreign Minister Wang Yi would be followed by more official visits. “We believe the new government of Myanmar will do its utmost to improve the national economy. It is in the interest of both our countries to continue work on the Myitsone project, taking into account the lessons learned,” he said.U Thein Sein’s suspension of the dam project, citing environmental, logistical and social concerns, was applauded in parliament in 2011 and welcomed at the time by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. She said every government should “listen to the worries of people and solve these by thinking deeply”.Now that her party is in office, many are awaiting her decision.","/business/20234-chinese-foreign-ministry-hosts-industry-tours.html"
"177",177,"China launches local charm offensive",2016-05-11,"Business","One day after Myanmar’s new government took office, China’s Wanbao Mining – joint operator of the controversial Letpadaung copper mine in Sagaing Region – released a public relations video.           “A New Dawn” is a 10-minute film explaining why the project was suspended in 2012. In some ways, it is an apology for the harm it caused local residents. It also focuses on the importance of what Wanbao calls the “social licence” to do business.“If we do not take social risk into account,” deputy general manager Luo Daqing says to camera, “if we don’t serve the local community well, and ensure stability, then without the support of local people, no matter how much money we have, or how good our technology is, the project will not succeed.”For decades when Myanmar was under military rule, China dominated foreign investment and, like the Tatmadaw, felt no need to engage local communities. It could do business with support from the junta, while sacrificing the goodwill of those forced to give up their land and livelihoods.In 2011, when U Thein Sein’s quasi-civilian government took over, China’s fortunes changed. It became a scapegoat. Cancelling Chinese projects was an easy way for the military to seem committed to reform. As communities spoke out against ill treatment, projects were suspended.While countless jade mines, real estate developments and logging activities continue undisturbed, many of China’s largest schemes in Myanmar – a US$8 billion dam in Myitsone, a $20 billion railway across the country, and the Letpadaung copper mine – were called off.The former government was reluctant to approve any new major Chinese-backed projects until the final days of its term, but China finds itself now with a rare opportunity. Two major projects were approved in Kyaukphyu and Dawei. Suspended projects such as Letpadaung, Myitsone, a coal plant in southern Shan State and other smaller hydropower dams are back on the table.At first glance it seems China might be serious about corporate social responsibility. In early April, state-controlled China Daily ran a six-page special on Myanmar. Its front-page headline declared, “Lending a hand: Chinese firms realise the value of helping local communities as they focus on building a long-term presence in Myanmar.”Its message: Gone are the days of Chinese companies stealing land and natural resources and destroying the environment. China, it said, has understood the importance of responsible investment.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, visiting Nay Pyi Taw in April, was enthusiastic about improving economic relations through investment. “We agreed to solve issues amicably and through friendly relations,” he said after meeting Foreign Minister Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.Read more: Chinese foreign ministry hosts industry toursYet despite smooth talk from Beijing, which is worried about a perceived bias against Chinese investment, rhetoric among China’s companies is inconsistent.Upstream Ayeyarwady Confluence Basin Hydropower, a developer of the Myitsone hydropower project, has a new website aimed at busting “myths” about the controversial dam. Among its links to research and editorials there is a recent article by the Centre for China and Globalisation.“For poor and weak Myanmar,” it begins, “electric power construction is the basic premise of national development.”It dismisses criticism of the project as “based on imagination and prejudice”, and blames Japan for controlling “many important media in Myanmar” and making “many false criticisms of Myitsone Hydropower Project through these media”. Local communities are called “unsophisticated mountainous villagers”.It is a less-than-polished exercise in public relations. Yet it offers some insight into the thinking behind China’s new community engagement campaigns, not just in Myanmar.The problem faced by China is explained by the Beijing-based think tank as follows: Asia’s largest economy has “incontestable” hard power in infrastructure and development, but lacks the corresponding soft power “such as media, religions and social organisations”.To solve this “imbalance”, it says, work related to media and social organisations must begin in Myanmar and elsewhere.“In the construction of the Belt and Road [a strategy of developing overseas markets through huge infrastructure projects] China shall pursue not only the smooth road networks but also the smooth human networks, and realise not only the production output but also the favourable impression output,” it concludes.Last year, in a Yangon restaurant, Wang Ping, the company’s head of public affairs for Myanmar, passionately defended the dam. The crux of his argument was Myanmar’s need for power. He repeatedly stressed that the company was providing a public service.He brushed over concerns that the project had exacerbated conflict between the Tatmadaw and the Kachin Independence Army, saying that Myanmar would need to work hard to win back investor confidence. He appeared perplexed that the dam had been suspended at all, saying, “It’s a matter of national pride. Why do they not restart it?”He also pointed the finger at the former military regime. “In the old Myanmar, the old government era, you couldn’t talk freely, and everything was done on a government-to-government basis. You couldn’t check with families about their wishes or whether they were willing to relocate.”Families maintain they are not willing to relocate, however. Last November residents of Aung Myin Thar new village, a compound built by the Chinese developer, told The Myanmar Times they hoped the new government would cancel the project, allowing them to return home.Vicky Bowman, director of the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business, wants to give credit where credit is due, noting that some Chinese companies are moving in the right direction.State Power Investment Corporation, a developer of the Myitsone hydropower project, has the most comprehensive website and “the most sophisticated approach to stakeholder engagement” of all Chinese companies in Myanmar, Ms Bowman says.“They identify both national and local-level opinion-formers, including those who are hostile to the project.”Myanmar Yangtse Copper Ltd, a sister company to Wanbao, get marks for its Sustainability Report for the S&K mine which Ms Bowman says is “more extensive than most reports produced by any other investor in Myanmar, certainly any other mining company”.Wanbao, at the centre of the Letpadaung dispute, is one of the few mining companies in Myanmar to have undertaken and disclosed a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment which is downloadable in both Myanmar and English. However its Environment Management Plan is said to need further development.In a further sign of engagement, China National Petroleum Corporation sent representatives to the launch of the latest report by the Myanmar China Pipeline Watch Committee in January, which was critical of the twin pipelines project. “Their presence and willingness to engage was appreciated by civil society representatives, who had previously found the company difficult to approach,” Ms Bowman says. – Guy DinmoreLast December, CITIC Corporation, one of China’s largest conglomerates, won a bid with five other firms to build a deep-sea port and industrial zone in Rakhine State’s Kyaukphyu.The state-owned giant operates two pipelines that carry oil and gas from an offshore platform in the Bay of Bengal across Myanmar into Yunnan. In Kyaukphyu where the pipelines come ashore and groundwork for the industrial zone is being laid, the company began offering financial incentives to isolated villages last year.It is confident the project will be well received, according to the China Daily special report, and plans to preserve the environment, improve local infrastructure, and share the dividends with Myanmar’s government and local people.It will provide training opportunities, anti-disaster and emergency rescue centres, “50 clinics and 50 schools” and a social development fund to support local government and residents.Yet not all villagers seem convinced. Ma Su, 30, told The Myanmar Times last year that some well-connected individuals had ended up with K2 million and others only K50,000. “That’s only enough money to buy one piglet,” she said.Similarly in Letpadaung, local people last week protested angrily outside the copper mine, denouncing the seizure of their land, inadequate compensation and damage to the environment. For all its polished videos, Wanbao still refuses to speak to the Myanmar media.U Maung Maung Lay, vice chair of trade federation UMFCCI, says that despite better public relations, the overriding problem is that “some Chinese companies are neither ethical nor responsible”.“Being a huge country, the Chinese government cannot control them. China itself is suffering in many areas due to this and tarnishing its image worldwide,” he said.Together with local companies in Myanmar, including the economic branch of the military, Chinese firms have “dumped substandard ... products and services into our country”, he said.Now that Beijing understands the need for an image overhaul, the “PR has started”, he added. Still, if companies can genuinely become ethical and responsible, then progress is possible over time, he said.“We cannot ignore our great neighbour,” he said. “We can be complementary to each other. We can benefit and grow further with her assistance and investment. The world, even the US, cannot ignore China.”","/business/20232-china-launches-local-charm-offensive.html"
"178",178,"Dawei locals launch campaign against Chinese oil refinery plans",2016-05-11,"Business","Tizit beach does not seem like the site of a multi-billion-dollar industrial showdown.This quiet stretch of coast just south of Dawei is today used mostly for swimming and fishing by local villagers or the occasional tourist (see related story).           But the northern area of the bay is set to become part of a Chinese plan to build Myanmar’s largest oil refinery – which controversially received approval in the final days of former president U Thein Sein’s administration.The estimated figure of US$3 billion would rank it among the biggest foreign investments for the country but an investigation by The Myanmar Times has found the development remains cloaked in uncertainty and confidentiality, with many residents and businesses excluded from a process that looks set to drastically impact their lives.The project is due to be built by Chinese developer Guangdong Zhenrong Energy Co. It will be the first oil refinery the commodity-trading company has built.The company has a 70 percent stake in a consortium along with military-linked Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited, state-owned Myanma Petrochemical Enterprise (MPE) and Yangon Engineering Group, controlled by Htoo Group.Material obtained from the Chinese company shows the plan includes an offshore site directly in front of Tizit beach, pipelines that cut through villages and the refinery itself on nearby land owned by Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited.Villagers claim that despite the scale of the project, there has been very little information, let alone consultation, from the company.Many residents in Hnyin Maw village face relocation if construction goes ahead. At a small community meeting, everyone in attendance was vehemently against the refinery.“We won’t relocate from this area even if they try and force us to go,” resident Daw Than Nwe said, arguing the process would severely impact community ties.Fellow resident U Mg Mg Aye, who is also vice president of the Dawei Nationalities Party, was especially vocal in his criticism.“It will severely harm the environment in a region where we mostly work in fishing and farming,” he said.Younger resident Ko Han Myo Swan told the meeting that it was time to reach out to the new National League for Democracy-led government about their concerns “as soon as possible”.The mood was similar in nearby Tizit village, which also faces relocations. Here, store owner U Kyaw Zwar said the lack of information meant he and fellow villagers were forced to do their own research into the impact of the project which he said will be “harmful”.Tizit village “relies on the fishing industry”, 72-year-old U Myint Soe added.“We heard that the pipeline from the refinery will cross our village and our fishing area will be affected,” he said. “If they force us to relocate … my children will leave school and go to Thailand as migrant workers,” he said, on the point of tears.Misinformation and contradictory statements were heard across surrounding villages. Some thought work was due to begin as early as June. Compensation was discussed but no one knew exactly how much. Job opportunities at the oil refinery were seen as an impossibility as villagers “don’t even know how to type”. Health concerns were especially prevalent.As a result more than 2000 people from six nearby villages have so far signed a petition calling for the project to be scrapped.“The community has the right to say no to such a project which will impact their future development,” said Ko Thant Zin of the Dawei Development Association, which is facilitating the petition.Guangdong Zhenrong Energy Co says the majority of interactions with villagers around Dawei had been outsourced to Resource and Environment Myanmar, a consultancy.When presented with villagers’ concerns by The Myanmar Times, Guangdong Zhenrong Energy Co indicated that there would be an increased effort to communicate with villagers in future.Further emphasis would be made to answer villagers’ questions and explain the professional opportunities that will be available to them through the project.But equally concerned are investors behind the planned Mandolis Resort, an eco-resort being built directly behind Tizit Beach.The resort had been under construction since November 2015, with the first stage scheduled to open later this year.“It was a big shock. There was no warning,” said investor Nawar Al Bitar of the news that the project had been approved by the outgoing government in late March. Work at the eco-resort has since been stopped temporarily.Mr Al Bitar said the oil refinery would deal a blow to tourism not just on Tizit beach, but around the region.“A tourism industry and an oil refinery cannot exist beside each other on the Dawei peninsula. It’s one or the other,” he said. “Otherwise tourists will now think twice about coming here.”This concern is echoed by other tourist ventures across Dawei.U Aung Soe Oo, Secretary General of Myanmar Hotelier Association in Tanintharyi, said the number of tourists had “surged” over recent years.Numbers from the Tanintharyi Region Department of Hotels and Tourism showed that more than 331,000 tourists arrived in 2015 from border crossings alone, up from around 269,000 in 2014.“Since this tourism boom, migrant workers have returned to the region and started their own small businesses,” U Aung Soe Oo said.But he and others in the association worry that the oil refinery will “spoil” the image of Dawei.Neither the Myanmar Hotelier Association in Tanintharyi or the Tanintharyi Region Department of Hotel and Tourism had received any information about the project from the company.The growing controversy has fallen front and centre for the new NLD chief minister of Tanintharyi Region, Daw Lae Lae Maw. But still confusion reigns.“I don’t know about the agreement with the previous central government and the companies throughout the region,” she said.Daw Lae Lae Maw intends to “scrutinise” this case and listen to the concerns of local villagers.“I think if the community keeps complaining about the project … it shouldn’t begin,” she said.A number of stakeholders said that it was not only the villages and pristine location that made the oil refinery questionable. The geography appears to be far from ideal for a development such as this.Between the beach and oil refinery is a section of jagged hills that Guangdong Zhenrong Energy Co has confirmed that they will need to tunnel under.One industry observer, asking not to be named, questioned the logic of building here when much more suitable sites exist nearby, including the Dawei special economic zone.“One can only assume that the location has been decided not on the basis of Myanmar’s national or economic interest, but because Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings is seeking to turn the land on which their palm oil plantation stands into something more lucrative,” the industry observer said.Other industry analysts question the economic viability of the refinery, saying it is too small to compete with other mega-refineries in south Asia.Meanwhile the project’s potential effects on the environment are shrouded in uncertainty. Guangdong Zhenrong Energy Co confirmed that it had submitted the required Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) paperwork to the government last year. However key stakeholders say they have not received it for review. This appears to put the company in violation of the new 2015 Environmental Impact Assessment Procedures which state EIAs need to be circulated “to civil society, project-affected persons, local communities and other concerned stakeholders … not later than 15 days after submission”. Non-compliance would mean the company faces “penalties and other administrative punishment”.The Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business, which recently published a report on disclosure of EIAs in Myanmar, has searched without success for the refinery’s paperwork.“An EIA should include proper public disclosure and consultation at all stages of the process,” said director Vicky Bowman. “To my knowledge, none of this has been done.”This apparent lapse comes as Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang this week renewed a call on Chinese companies operating in Myanmar to strictly follow local laws.“The Chinese government has consistently demanded that Chinese companies investing abroad respect the laws and rules of the host nation, and fulfil their responsibility and obligation to society, including paying attention to protecting the environment,” Mr Lu said.Challenges as well as opportunities surrounding this development are nothing new for Chinese companies, however.China has a long record of building large-scale infrastructure projects in developing countries or in countries it sees as strategically significant, both for economic and security reasons.Adjunct associate professor Jonathan Bogais, a specialist in Southeast Asian affairs at the University of Sydney, said this case was less an economic investment and more a move to cement regional influence.“Other countries, including Japan, are keen to invest [in that area], so there is a priority for China. This is about strategic control, more than profits.”So far the NLD government has remained quiet over whether it will allow the oil refinery to go ahead. For the people of Dawei, and more broadly in Myanmar, it is emerging as an early test of the new government, caught between respecting the wishes of its electorate and the geopolitical realities of dealing with its powerful neighbour.","/business/20230-dawei-locals-launch-campaign-against-chinese-oil-refinery-plans.html"
"179",179,"China’s rise takes centre stage at ADB annual meeting",2016-05-06,"Business","China's growing economic influence through the One Belt, One Road initiative and the newly operational Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank were key topics of discussion at the Asian Development Bank’s annual conference in Frankfurt this week.           The Chinese-led AIIB has 57 founding members with others expected to join. The One Belt, One Road (OBOR) project aims to strengthen infrastructure on the land and sea routes from China through Central Asia and Southeast Asia respectively – incorporating some 60 separate states.Both initiatives affect Myanmar, as a member country of the AIIB and as a host to Chinese OBOR infrastructure projects – including a recently approved US$3 billion refinery near the southern city of Dawei.Countries like Myanmar that lie along the OBOR routes are likely to receive fresh flows of foreign direct investment as China steps up its efforts to put capital to work outside the country. But China’s growing influence also raises concerns in those same countries.The OBOR initiative is the economic foundation for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s “China dream agenda, which envisions China becoming the paramount nation of Asia and perhaps Eurasia by 2049”, said David Arase, professor of international politics at Johns Hopkins University’s Hopkins-Nanjing Center in China, during a panel discussion on OBOR.As part of that initiative China wants trade connections with countries and regions across Eurasia, but with this will come influence.“OBOR gives China tremendous ability to set agendas and advance [its] own interests,” said Mr Arase. “In the security dimension it will open up to China access to the rest of the region, because wherever China’s trade and investment goes [the country] will have an interest in securing its interests.”This is already evident in countries like Djibouti and Pakistan, where a Chinese military presence has followed Chinese trade and investment, he added.But AIIB president Jin Liqun, speaking at a separate panel discussion on Asia-European trade, said that the OBOR initiative is no longer just China’s project.“China cannot reach out and impose all those [prospective] projects in those countries,” he said.Countries along the OBOR route will only participate if they see benefits, he added, and therefore the OBOR’s success hinges on cooperation.The AIIB and the ADB announced this week they intend to jointly finance Pakistan’s M4 highway project – a 64-kilometre stretch of highway in the east of Pakistan. This will be one of the first projects undertaken by the Beijing-based AIIB.Conference delegates raised concerns that China could use the AIIB and OBOR to “export overcapacity” in certain sectors of its economy – for example using excess steel for projects in foreign countries.But although overcapacity in industries like steel and cement is a serious issue in China, the idea that China would seek to export that through the AIIB or OBOR is misplaced, said Ligang Song, director of the China Economy Program at Australian National University, on the OBOR panel debate.“The reason is simple,” he said. “First of all the overcapacity [problem] has to be solved in the short to medium term and the OBOR is a long-term strategy. Second, president Jin has mentioned [that the] AIIB has a very transparent way of running the bank.”Overcapacity is most evident in Chinese firms that are inefficient and badly run, and such companies are unlikely to meet the high standards that the AIIB has promised for its tenders, Mr Song said.China’s neighbour India recognizes the potential benefits of the OBOR plan, and bilateral trade between China and India has increased, said M M Pallam Raju, former minister of state in India’s Ministry of Defence. But India is not sanguine about the implications of the OBOR initiative.“There’s a strong case for creating better infrastructure across the region … and if OBOR is [providing this], from an economic perspective India definitely welcomes it,” he said. “But at the same time we have certain concerns.”There is a need for more information sharing between India and China, which is “not necessarily viewed as a benign power”, he added. “China has to be more transparent especially when it comes to sharing specifics regarding the [OBOR] project.”China is also investing heavily in another of its neighbours, Kazakhstan – particularly in the oil and gas industry, where Chinese projects control more than 25pc of the country’s oil and gas production, according to Olzhas Khudaibergenov, director at the Center for Macroeconomic Research, Kazakhstan.“Kazakhstan warmly welcomes the OBOR initiative, as Kazakhstan is a land-locked country and the initiative helps us use our transit potential,” he said. A World Bank-funded project to improve the Kazakh highway along the Western Europe-Western China road corridor will be finished this year, he added.But protests have flared up in Kazakhstan in the past week due to concern over a law that would allow foreigners to rent land for up to 25 years. The protesters are particularly concerned about Chinese investment in agricultural land, Mr Khudaibergenov said.“Cooperation between the [two] countries should be on a mutually beneficial basis,” he said. “China’s move into agricultural projects will not have any benefits for Kazakhstan.”Kazakhstan’s population and GDP are both around 1pc of China’s, he said. . “If China [rents] 1 or 2 million hectares of land and can bring in its own labour force there will be many bad consequences.”Territorial disputes in the South China Sea between China and other nations are one of the most visible manifestations of China’s growing economic and political ambitions. By threatening freedom of navigation the dispute threatens international free trade, said Mr Arase of the Hopkins-Nanjing Center.“Freedom of navigation is the necessary condition for the World Trade Organization working,” he said. “If you don’t have freedom of navigation that treaty is worthless.”In response to a question from The Myanmar Times on whether the South China Sea dispute threatened trade, AIIB president Mr Jin said that China believes the issue should be resolved amicably.“I hope all the parties concerned will sit down and talk and seek peaceful resolution,” he said.Stephen Groff, the ADB’s vice president for operations 2, responded to the same question during the Asian-European trade debate. He said that although territorial disputes are challenging and hard to overcome, Asian countries have far better diplomatic relationships than in the past.“Look back 50 years in Asia – countries were at war,” he said. “Countries did not have diplomatic relations with one another. That’s not the situation we see today. These are challenging issues, but I’m optimistic that there are shared common interests at heart, whether economic or cultural, that can help resolve them.”","/business/20162-china-s-rise-takes-centre-stage-at-adb-annual-meeting.html"
"180",180,"Asia: Sailing in turbulent times",2016-05-04,"Opinion","Asian economies are sailing in choppy waters, facing severe headwinds from an uncertain and challenging global environment, but the region also has many strong points in its favour. The global recovery has been uneven and weaker than expected. On top of that, global trade has been sluggish and financial conditions have been volatile.           The rise of China as a global economic superpower has also created challenges of its own, as China’s necessary rebalancing from manufacturing toward services and investment to a consumption-driven economy – critical for both China’s and global growth over the medium term – remains bumpy.As elsewhere, many Asian economies face risks associated with natural disasters as well as geopolitical and domestic political uncertainty. But all is not doom and gloom, as Asia also has considerable strengths on which policy-makers can build.The region remains the major engine of the global economy: It continues to provide nearly two-thirds of global growth. In addition, the region has policy buffers such as current account surpluses and high reserve levels and has used macroprudential policies well to help bolster financial stability.It is also likely to benefit from further economic integration and regional and multilateral trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.According to the most recent IMF World Economic Outlook, activity in the region moderated in the second half of 2015, and is expected to continue decelerating in the near term. GDP growth for the region is forecast at 5.3 percent in both 2016 and 2017, a meager 0.1 percentage points lower than in 2015. In addition to weaker global growth and sluggish trade, the moderation in regional growth also reflects the ongoing necessary rebalancing in China.But while external demand is relatively weak, domestic demand, particularly consumption, is expected to remain resilient across most of the region. The relative strength of domestic demand is due to generally low unemployment, lower commodity prices (which is a boon to oil and commodity importers), economic stimulus in some countries, and ongoing secular trends, including steadily rising disposable income.The moderation in Asia’s growth masks important differences within the region. In China, GDP growth is expected to continue to moderate to 6.5pc this year and 6.2pc in 2017.This reflects ongoing rebalancing and other structural reforms, which are expected to continue to boost consumption and the services sector, while investment and manufacturing remains relatively weak until excess capacity is resolved.India, on the other hand, is expected to remain the fastest-growing large economy in the world, with GDP expanding by 7.5pc in 2016-17, underpinned by strong private consumption and helped by lower oil prices. In Japan, GDP growth is projected to remain at 0.5pc in 2016, slowing to -0.1pc in 2017 as the widely anticipated consumption tax rate hike from 8 to 10pc kicks in –although this does not take into account offsetting measures that are likely to be introduced.Despite a resilient outlook, downside risks continue to dominate the economic landscape.Global growth could slow more than expected or financial conditions could tighten suddenly. As many economies in the region have seen debt levels rise rapidly over the last decade, a combination of slower growth and higher borrowing costs could send some corporations and households over the edge and further constrain growth.In addition, regional growth is more dependent on China than ever before, which presents both challenges and opportunities. While rebalancing in China is a price worth paying in terms of durable and resilient growth over the longer term, the short-term transition is likely to be bumpy and the impact on countries and markets is likely to vary.Countries that export goods that support China’s investment and construction – producers of metals, for example – would be adversely affected, while others that export consumer goods to China or are destinations for rapidly-growing Chinese tourism could benefit.In addition, China’s move to higher value-added production will provide opportunities for low-income Asian countries, particularly in labour-intensive sectors such as apparel, footwear, furniture and plastic toys.Already Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam have seen market share gains in these sectors. Financial linkages are also growing with regional markets becoming more sensitive to shocks from China after the global financial crisis. Over time, though, as economic rebalancing makes China’s growth model more resilient and sustainable, the region is likely to benefit.In addition to building buffers, policymakers should deploy macroeconomic policies to boost demand if needed.But more importantly, structural reforms will be key to support economic transitions and the emergence of new growth models. This will bolster regional potential growth and ultimately strengthen the region’s resilience to global shocks.Structural reforms and policies, particularly fiscal policy, also have a critical role to play in tackling long-standing challenges, such as rising inequality, which in turn will help make growth more inclusive. The key in this regard is to provide equality of opportunities, in particular to broaden access to education and health and promote financial and gender inclusion.Myanmar’s economy is poised to rebound from the impact of last year’s floods but economic vulnerability remains. Real GDP growth is expected to bounce back from around 7pc last fiscal year to about 8.5pc this year, as the impact of the floods dissipates and investment increases following the smooth political transition.However, underlying inflationary pressures are likely to be persistent as domestic demand continues to be strong and supply bottlenecks remain. The current account deficit is expected to remain elevated. Overall, downside risks have increased, with external risks arising from China’s slowdown and uncertainty in the global financial market.Given the continued macroeconomic imbalances, maintaining macroeconomic stability should remain a top objective for economic policy. To this end, Myanmar needs to keep fiscal deficits in check and tighten monetary conditions – including through phasing out direct central bank financing of fiscal deficits – while maintaining exchange rate flexibility. China’s rebalancing will have significant implications for Myanmar. On the one hand, as the Chinese economy shifts from manufacturing to services and from investment to consumption, its demand for fossil fuel – ie natural gas – and industrial materials from Myanmar could slow. On the other hand, there are likely to be greater opportunities to export agricultural products and services – ie tourism – to China.Like elsewhere, to take advantage of these opportunities, Myanmar needs to proactively pursue structural reforms and improve its physical and social infrastructure to strengthen external competitiveness. Maintaining macroeconomic stability, including keeping inflation low and avoiding kyat overvaluation, will also be essential to export expansion.Yasuhisa Ojima is the IMF resident representative in Myanmar.","/opinion/20112-asia-sailing-in-turbulent-times.html"
"181",181,"China-led development bank to visit Myanmar ",2016-05-04,"Business","The president of the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank plans to visit Myanmar this year to start identifying potential projects, he told The Myanmar Times.           The AIIB has not yet begun talks with the new government, but Jin Liqun intends to travel to Myanmar to start investigating initiatives for the bank to work on before the year is out, he said on the sidelines of the annual Asian Development Bank meeting in Frankfurt.Mr Jin said the new development bank, which started operations earlier this year, would identify a batch of potential projects across its member states at its third board meeting in June, but had not yet considered how to balance operations across different countries, regions or sectors.“We will process the projects that are ready and bankable, so countries that have those [types of] projects would be the best candidates,” he said.But as Myanmar is an AIIB member country the bank also has a “duty to help finance infrastructure in Myanmar”, Mr Jin said.“Even in low-income countries [like Myanmar] I believe we can have profitable, productive infrastructure projects,” he said, identifying power and transport as the two most likely sectors for early AIIB involvement in Myanmar.The AIIB signed an MoU with the Asian Development Bank this week, which sets the stage for jointly financing projects, and has already signed a similar agreement with the World Bank.Mr Jin told delegates in Frankfurt this week that the AIIB plans to sign an agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development later this month.These agreements will facilitate joint-financing projects in Myanmar, although the AIIB is also searching for solo projects, Mr Jin told The Myanmar Times.“If the existing development institutions like the World Bank or ADB have identified a good project and if they want us to be involved we are happy to co-finance,” he said.“Meanwhile, we are identifying projects on our own, so we hope the government institutions will propose some bankable projects for us to work on.”In furthering its economic development Myanmar could also develop a close relationship with China to take advantage of that country’s economic growth, Mr Jin said.China is already Myanmar’s largest trading partner and one of its biggest investors. But Chinese-led projects, like the Letpadaung copper mine in Sagaing Region and the multi-billion-dollar Myitsone hydropower dam in Kachin State, often attract criticism.On March 29, the last full day in office for the previous government, the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) approved a Chinese-led US$3 billion oil refinery project. Local groups have already voiced resistance.China holds just over 26 percent of the AIIB’s shares – giving it far more voting power than any other member state. This has led to concerns that the development bank could be a vehicle for furthering Chinese influence across Asia.When asked if existing concerns about Chinese firms and Chinese influence could be an issue for the AIIB’s operations in Myanmar, Mr Jin pointed to the bank’s standards on awarding tenders.“We practise internationally competitive bidding [for project tenders],” he said.“For any AIIB-financed project in Myanmar or any other country Chinese firms can participate – but only through an international-standard competitive bidding [process]. That’s the key.”The AIIB is still developing some of its policies, including its energy strategy, he said. That strategy will determine whether the bank can fund coal-fired power plants, and if so under what conditions, Mr Jin said.“Because of concerns around global warming there are some issues we need to discuss as we move forward,” he said.Myanmar only has one coal-fired power plant, located in southern Shan State. This has been out of use for several years, although Chinese firm Wuxi Huagaung Electric Power Engineering plans to restart operations later this month, officials from the Ministry of Electricity and Energy said recently.ADB and World Bank officials told The Myanmar Times earlier this year that they would not fund coal-fired power plants in Myanmar.Unlike the ADB and the World Bank, the AIIB will not offer concessional funding aimed at poverty reduction. But it is building a separate fund that will help improve local institutions, Mr Jin said.“We’ll have a special fund [provided by] China, and maybe some other countries,” he said.“This can be used to help prepare projects and for institutional capacity building. I’m sure it will materalise soon, and of course Myanmar will be eligible.”","/business/20105-china-led-infra-bank-to-visit-myanmar.html"
"182",182,"Dawei residents protest against  $3 billion oil refinery ",2016-05-03,"Business","A collection of civil society groups in the southern city of Dawei has begun to actively protest a Chinese-led US$3 billion proposal to build Myanmar’s largest oil refinery on their doorstep.           Local businesses, civil society organisations and villagers are circulating a petition calling for the new National League for Democracy-led government to reconsider the project – which received approval on the last full day of former president U Thein Sein’s administration.Local residents were hardly involved in the approval process, according to the appeal, which suggests the environmental effects of the 100,000-barrels-per-day project may be catastrophic.More than 2000 people from six villages have signed the petition, according to the Dawei Development Association.“The community has the right to say no to such a project which will impact their future development,” said Ko Thant Zin, the group’s coordinator.Citing planned relocation for multiple villages, Ko Thant Zin said that many people now stand to “lose their land and livelihood”.“[So far] the local communities have only received one-sided information from the developers. Government authorities have provided us with no information.”He said that the environmental impacts of the refinery are likely to include “loss and damage of biodiversity” around the site and that nearby fishing grounds will be hit by “huge tankers [which] transport crude oil”.Local groups also confirmed they will be lobbying local government members in Dawei in the days ahead.The project gained steam on March 29 when Chinese state-controlled commodity trader Guangdong Zhenrong Energy Co announced they had received approval from the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC).That day the company also signed an agreement to take a 70 percent stake in the project consortium with military-linked Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited, state-owned Myanma Petrochemical Enterprise (MPE) and Yangon Engineering Group, controlled by Htoo Group. The headline figure of $3 billion would make the refinery among the biggest single foreign investments into Myanmar.The Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA) has since said the prospective location for the refinery is 3 miles (4.8 kilometres) south of Launglon township in Dawei district, on MEHL-owned land that was formerly used as a palm oil plantation.The Myanmar Times understands that an Environmental Compliance Certificate based on the contents of Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Reports is yet to be issued.Several actors have claimed that the process around these reports has not been sufficiently transparent.Investors behind the planned Mandolis Resort at Tizit Beach, an eco-resort being built in the vicinity of the proposed site, are particularly upset about the potential environmental impact. The resort is under construction and scheduled to open later in 2016 after several years of development. According to promotional material for the resort “the foundations of all buildings of the first stage are finished”.Investor Nawar Al Bitar said if the oil refinery goes ahead then the project will be stopped “due to environmental reasons”.“There will be no tourists on the whole Dawei Peninsula,” he said.","/business/20090-dawei-residents-protest-against-3-billion-oil-refinery.html"
"183",183,"Vehicles and machinery held up at Myanmar’s borders",2016-05-02,"Business","Recent restrictions on importing vehicles and machinery into Myanmar from China and Thailand are causing headaches for leasing and logistics companies.           The government has made it far harder for firms to bring vehicles and machinery across the country’s land borders in recent months.The restrictions started around four months ago, partly in response to huge volumes of trucks and other types of machinery entering Myanmar from China, said businesspeople in the automobile, leading and logistics industries.“It got to the point where it was bedlam and there was no control over it,” said John Hamilton, country manager for CEA Project Logistics.This sheer volume of imports made regulation difficult, resulting in unregistered imports and tax manipulation, said industry figures.Last December the government closed Kachin State’s Kan Pike Tee border trading station to vehicle and machinery imports, following allegations that illegally imported heavy machinery was being used at the jade mines in Hpakant, resulting in a spike in deadly landslides.Regulating trade at some Thai border crossings has also been problematic, said U Khin Tun, managing director of Capital Automotive – the sole dealer of Ford vehicles in Myanmar.The government’s response was to make it much more difficult to import vehicles and industrial machinery at those border points, industry figures said.Businesspeople with a Myanmar Investment Commission licence to import a specific project have not been affected, and farmers can still import tractors although not large machinery.But leasing and logistics firms are facing severe problems.Mr Hamilton said before the border restrictions he could have asked a trading company to buy a forklift in Bangkok and within four days secured a permit to bring it across the border.But the Muse and Myawaddy border points – the main trading points with China and Thailand – are now shut to most kinds of heavy machinery and vehicles, he said.“Now everything has stopped. I’ve just bought a trailer which will be ready in June, so I need to figure out how I’m going to bring it in [to Myanmar],” he said.Logistics and leasing companies do not have import licences, which means they rely on trading companies or dealers with showroom licences to import vehicles and machinery.Imports can still come through ports in Yangon, but the government has also tightened restrictions on import permits – limiting logistics and leasing firms to only 10 of a particular type of vehicle or machine.And although dealers with showroom licences can still import equipment and vehicles, there are not many of these.“We have a trailer in Thailand [that’s been there] since the end of January, which we can’t bring in because we can’t find anyone with a showroom licence to import it,” said Allan Davidson, general manager at leasing firm Yoma Fleet.Industry figures could only point to only two truck dealers with showroom licences – Scandia Trucks dealer Scandia Myanmar and Mercedes dealer Cycle & Carriage Automobile Myanmar.“The biggest issue is trucks,” said Mr Davidson, adding that for pick-up trucks and smaller cars shortage was less of an issue.Ford’s dealer Capital Automotive has a good stock of cars and has been managing its business well, he added. Mitsubishi, which has a partnership with Yoma Strategic Holdings, recently received a showroom licence and an import order has arrived at Yangon’s port, he added.Suzuki has a manufacturing plant in Myanmar, which means vehicles can be delivered to Yangon in just five days, he added.“We just cleaned them [Mitsubishi] out of white vehicles,” Mr Davidson said. “We placed an order with Toyota [this week] for delivery in July, but customers want things yesterday.”U Khin Tun, Capital Automotive’s managing director, said stricter border controls had not affected his business because his firm imports its vehicles by sea to Yangon port. That route is also cheaper, he added, although the process of getting imports offloaded and though customs can be time-consuming.Not all logistics firms are affected by the import restrictions, which are primarily an issue for companies looking to import specialist, high-quality or specific branded equipment.When it comes to basic-level trucks and trailers the local logistics market is in fact oversupplied, said U Ni Moe Aung, general manager for Kerry Logistics Myanmar office.He described the oversupply as a seasonal trend. Firms were eager to secure imports before Chinese New Year in February and the Myanmar New Year holiday in April, while government enterprises are typically keen to use up their budgets before the end of the fiscal year on March 31.But for more sophisticated projects – for example those requiring transporting very heavy cargo – machinery and vehicles are hard to secure. It is for these projects that border restrictions are an issue, he said.“It’s true the local logistics market is completely oversupplied,” said Yoma Fleet’s Mr Davidson.But although the restrictions are mainly affecting firms hoping to import “best-quality equipment”, they could also begin to correct some of the oversupply if they continue long enough, he added.U Ni Moe Aung said that although the new government’s policy on border imports is not yet clear, he expects it to relax the restrictions and show some degree of flexibility.","/business/20061-vehicles-and-machinery-held-up-at-myanmar-s-borders.html"
"184",184,"Chinese firm to restart Myanmar’s only coal plant",2016-04-28,"Business","A Chinese company is upgrading Myanmar’s only coal-fired power plant, with a view to resuming operations in late May according to officials from the Ministry of Electricity and Energy.           China’s Wuxi Huagaung Electric Power Engineering is upgrading the entire Tigyit plant in southern Shan State near to the famous Inle Lake, which has been out of use for several years.Local authorities held a public meeting in a village near to the site on April 24 to explain the company’s environmental and social impact assessment activities, ahead of the power plant’s reopening, the Electric Power Generation Enterprise (EPGE) announced on April 25.A tender to operate the coal-fired power plant under build-operate-transfer terms was issued by the previous government and Wuxi Huagaung was selected as the winner, the announcement said. The investment agreement for the plant’s long-term operation was signed on October 22 last year.Wuxi Huagaung is now reinstalling major parts such as boilers and turbines, an official from EPGE told The Myanmar Times.“The updating process is now under way. It was supposed to start again in early May, but has been delayed a little – perhaps until later in the month,” said U Win Myint, an EPGE director.Tigyit is the country’s first coal-fired power plant, built by Myanma Electric Power Enterprise in 2001. Operations first started in 2005, led by the China National Heavy Machinery Corporation with local companies Eden Group and Shan Yoma Nagar.Two villages were forced to relocate for the project, more than 500 acres of farmland were confiscated, and explosions from the mine destroyed local pagodas, according to a 2011 report by the the Pa-Oh Youth Organization called “Poison Clouds: Lessons from Burma’s largest coal project at Tigyit”.The extensive report notes that air and water pollution from the mine threatened the agriculture and health of nearly 12,000 people living within a 5-mile radius of the project and that 50 percent of the local population suffered from skin rashes.A newly installed boiler is designed to meet the World Bank’s environmental standards with low emission of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, the EPGE announcement said, and the environmental impact of restarting the power plant will be monitored.The plant has two coal-fired turbines with a capacity of 60 megawatts each.It was designed to generate 900 kilowatts per hour annually, but in reality generated much less than its installed capacity – about 25 to 30MW according to EPGE’s announcement.“One of the boilers has been completely changed with a new one due to its heating value and poor coal burning design. The power plant will be fuelled with coal from Chin State as before. But the turbines were updated for higher capacity,” said the official.Electricity from the plant will power Kalaw, Pinlaung and Taunggyi in southern Shan State, it said.The former government signed at least 11 contracts for coal-fired power plants around the country with a number of international and regional companies. None of these projects have yet moved forward due to wide opposition by the public, local residents and environmental groups.Coal power is a focus of the National Energy Master Plan drafted by the previous government. The government set a target of 100 percent electrification by 2030, with an energy mix of 33 percent biomass, 22pc oil, 20pc coal, 13pc gas, 11pc hydropower and 1pc renewable energy.“The environmental impact assessment for resuming the Tigyit plant was very thorough. The new government has been elected, so people do not need to worry about the resumption of coal power,” the official said.","/business/20010-chinese-firm-to-restart-myanmar-s-only-coal-plant.html"
"185",185,"NLD to look West, but not  ignore its tough neighbours",2016-04-22,"National News","Revered in the West almost as much as at home, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi may steer Myanmar’s foreign policy to a westward pivot to some degree, although the Nobel Peace Prize winner has already shown she understands the realities of dealing with powerful Asian neighbours.           The importance of relations with Beijing was emphasised when China’s Wang Yi became the first foreign minister invited to meet the new government, visiting his counterpart Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on April 5 and President U Htin Kyaw the next day.“I think it [the invitation] is really symbolic, it is a significant gesture. It is more symbolic than substantial. It shows goodwill diplomacy,” said Tang Xiaoyang, analyst at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing.As opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi received a top-level welcome on her first formal visit to Beijing in June 2015 in anticipation of the National League for Democracy’s sweeping election win five months later. Her role in 2013 as head of a parliamentary commission in allowing the controversial Letpadaung copper mine project – a joint venture between a state-owned Chinese firm and the Tatmadaw – to continue deeply disappointed some of her loyal supporters, but it raised expectations in Beijing that she can be a pragmatic partner.Still it was the personal rapport she has built with US President Barack Obama - and also with Hillary Clinton, his possible successor in the White House - which was on show when he called her and U Htin Kyaw on April 6 to convey his congratulations, commending her “determined efforts, over the course of many years and at great personal cost, to achieve a peaceful transfer of power and advance national reconciliation”.Gregory Poling, analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said the Oxford-educated leader with two British sons would be “more comfortable with the West” than her predecessors. But she has made clear that “Myanmar cannot change its geography” and she wants good relations with China as well.“Myanmar will balance its foreign policy, but it will not do so between ‘east’ and ‘west’; it will do so between a plethora of different countries,” said Mr Poling. “I expect we will see a serious effort to balance Myanmar’s relations between China, India, Japan, the rest of Southeast Asia, and the West.”Mr Tang doubts that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in her newly created position as state counsellor will embark on a major foreign policy shift toward the West. “Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is also a nationalist. She supports the development of Myanmar, not Western nations,” he said.For years to come China, Singapore, India, Japan, Thailand and others in Asia will most likely remain by far Myanmar’s largest investors and trading partners.Japan has reportedly put aside more than 100 billion yen (US$910 million) in loans and grants as development assistance, apparently at the request of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Tokyo hopes to finalise its support by June, according to the Japan Times.“The Chinese government does not give much development aid [to Myanmar], it is about commercial benefits. China sees Myanmar as a market place. For Japan there are geopolitical concerns,” said Mr Tang.Priscilla Clapp, a veteran Myanmar analyst and a former head of the US embassy in Yangon, says that the US should respond to the support and investment flowing into Myanmar from across the world by gradually lifting all its sanctions, which are inhibiting US organisations and businesses.Myanmar is likely to continue to experience human rights abuses, corruption and poor governance but sanctions may not always be the best solution, she said in a recent report for the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank.“In many cases, it may still be appropriate to address some of these issues with punitive measures, but they should not be enforced at the expense of US programs seeking to address the underlying causes of these abuses in Myanmar,” Ms Clapp wrote.Mr Poling said that existing US sanctions against targeted individuals were not having the desired effect and agreed that they hampered US investment. “At this point, most of the remaining sanctions – those which prevent US companies from doing business with individuals on the Specially Designated Nationals list – do little to pressure actors within Myanmar; they mainly limit the ability of US companies to effectively compete with counterparts from China, Japan, Korea and Europe in Myanmar,” he said.China, one of the few countries willing to do business with Myanmar when it was still an international pariah, has maintained considerable leverage – even after the Tatmadaw and former president U Thein Sein began the process of prising Myanmar away from its dependency on its powerful neighbour and making eagerly awaited openings to the West.The two countries share more than 2000 kilometres (1250 miles) of border, punctuated by trading posts but more defined by smuggling of natural resources and decades of civil war between the Tatmadaw and ethnic armed groups. Some observers of the peace process suspect that Chinese interference is to blame for the failure of last year’s “nationwide” ceasefire agreement, which attracted the signatures of mostly minor armed groups.Mr Tang rejects the view that the Chinese government has been directly involved in Myanmar’s ethnic conflicts but he says the peace talks are an important and closely observed part of relations with Myanmar.“Beijing respects the sovereignty of Myanmar. Groups with more [ethnic] affinity and some scholars and businessmen support the Kokang, saying they are Chinese. But that is not the official view,” he said, referring to the corner of Shan State where an ethnic Chinese armed group launched an abortive comeback last year.Ms Clapp, however, argues that the role of the Chinese is more than that of a mere interested party, with the government using the armed groups as a buffer between China and the nascent democracy next door.“China will likely be a deciding factor in whether the Myanmar government can eventually reach a comprehensive peace agreement with its armed ethnic-minority groups,” she said.","/national-news/19911-nld-to-look-west-but-not-ignore-its-tough-neighbours.html"
"186",186,"Doubts raised over Chinese oil refinery plan   ",2016-04-08,"Business","A Chinese-led US$3 billion plan to build Myanmar’s largest oil refinery near the southern city of Dawei has raised questions about China’s strategic intentions in launching apparently commercially unviable projects, while local groups have already signalled their opposition.           Guangdong Zhenrong Energy Co, a Chinese state-controlled commodity trader, said the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) had signed its approval at a ceremony in Nay Pyi Taw on March 29 – the last full day in office for U Thein Sein’s government.That day Guangdong Zhenrong also signed an agreement to take a 70 percent stake in the project consortium with military-linked Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited, state-owned Myanma Petrochemical Enterprise (MPE) and Yangon Engineering Group which is controlled by Htoo Group. The MIC confirmed it had signed its approval.The headline figure of $3 billion would put the project among the biggest single foreign investments for Myanmar and mark another step in China’s “One Belt One Road” strategy of developing overseas markets through mega-infrastructure projects.It would also pit China against other Asian interests on the narrow strip of land between Thailand and the Andaman Sea. Thailand has long been in discussions to build a deep-sea port in Dawei as part of a special economic zone and Japan has also said it would invest.An official of what was the ministry of energy – now merged by the new government with the ministry of electric power – said the Chinese company had been aiming for this project for seven years. He said MPE, which runs Myanmar’s three small ageing refineries, had joined the project because of an MIC ruling in 2015 that foreign investments in petro-chemicals had to be joint ventures.Industry rivals who had considered but rejected a similar project told The Myanmar Times that the Chinese-led venture, which includes an oil terminal, did not make sense.“Dawei does not make sense for a deep water port,” said one industrialist who asked not to be named, having estimated it would cost some $1 billion to build because of problems of sandbars and dredging. “The refinery is too small to be viable,” his business partner added.The planned refinery would have an output of 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) – more than the combined output of Myanmar’s existing refineries, but still not big enough to compete with refineries in Asia operating on slim margins but with an output of at least 600,000bpd.The industrialists and analysts also noted that China had meanwhile cancelled, or indefinitely postponed, plans to build a refinery in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, that would have used oil coming through the pipeline that crosses Myanmar to the Indian Ocean off Rakhine State.As a result that pipeline is now little used, raising further questions about the sense of some of China’s flagship projects in Myanmar.A Yangon-based lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the Myanmar government had been trying “desperately” to get a refinery “despite most investors warning that, due to low prices and existing surplus in China and India, it might not be easy to make it profitable”. He also noted that the deal had not been the result of a competitive tender.“A project such as this requires a lot more permits and approvals such as environmental, land use, zoning [and] operating permits. So if a new government wanted to, it can stop the project from going further without too much difficulty. I am not saying they will, just that they could,” he added.Analysts said China’s main priority appeared to be its plans to build a special economic zone in Rakhine’s Kyaukphyu with its natural deep harbour and access to the oil and gas pipelines leading to Yunnan. They also expect China to drop the controversial Myitsone dam project, as it stands, in northern Kachin State. Apart from its location close to conflict zones and its deep unpopularity, some analysts have also questioned its economic viability.The Dawei project might only make sense, they said, if the refinery was bigger and had access to a pipeline cutting eastward across to the Gulf of Thailand to tap the Thai market and for onward shipment to southern China.“Why was it approved?” asked an investment analyst who requested anonymity, noting that it came on the last day of the outgoing military-backed government, suggesting that China “had some favours to call in”.“Why such a big investment when the commodity market is on its knees, and projects are being shelved everywhere? It’s a nonsensical investment at this stage, but China does not seem to be concerned about cycles,” he added.A few analysts do see the project as feasible, however. BMI Research, part of Fitch Ratings Group, gave the plan a positive assessment.“Although the exact timeline for the project is not available, we remain confident that the project will go ahead for the following reasons: The investment is aligned with the strategic interests of both China and Myanmar. The project would allow Guangdong Zhenrong to make inroads into a growing Myanmar market. It will help to alleviate Myanmar’s yawning fuels deficit, which domestic refinery output is not able to meet,” BMI said.It said chronic under-utilisation of Myanmar’s three ageing refineries meant the country had to import to cover over 60pc of its annual fuel requirements.BMI estimated that consumption of refined products would rise from under the current 50,000bpd to 60,000bpd by 2020.President of KWR International Keith Rabin said Myanmar needs a deep sea port and the area is already closely linked to Thailand in terms of its local economy.“Further, having a refinery in that location which promises to allow petroleum supply from the Middle East to offload and be refined and sent to Thailand as well as Myanmar and other markets makes conceptual sense and can promise benefits in terms of added value, employment and broader economic development – though obviously it will not be easy,” he said.Commercial or strategic sense aside, the project is likely to face strong local headwinds.Ko Thant Zin, coordinator of the Dawei Development Association, a civil society group, said the Chinese company had approached the local community four years ago and even took some residents to China.“But they failed to get our welcome,” he told The Myanmar Times.The refinery and port would involve moving villages and would pose environmental risks to communities depending on fishing and hopeful of developing tourism.“Among the community there were strong protests against the project. They did not even let them know about the agreement and approved it within the last minutes of the government transition. It is very strange and can’t be acceptable,” Ko Thant Zin said.Daw Lae Lae Maw, the new chief minister of Tanintharyi who has worked as a doctor giving free health- care in remote villages, told The Irrawaddy that her priorities would be to develop agriculture and retrieve land confiscated by the former government and military-related holdings.She also said she would reassess investments in the Dawei seaport project. “If it doesn’t benefit the residents, we have no reason to accept it,” she was quoted as saying.Additional reporting by Su Phyo Win, Aung Shin and Steve Gilmore","/business/19901-doubts-raised-over-chinese-oil-refinery-plan.html"
"187",187,"China pledges support for  new Myanmar government",2016-04-06,"Yangon","Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi yesterday pledged Beijing’s support for Myanmar’s new government after holding talks with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi that touched on China’s sometimes controversial investment projects, including the suspended Myitsone dam.           “China will not interfere in internal affairs, but we strongly support the right choice of the Myanmar people,” Mr Wang told a joint news conference in Nay Pyi Taw, acknowledging the landslide election victory of the National League for Democracy last November.Mr Wang, the first senior foreign official to meet Daw Aung San Suu Kyi since the government took office on March 30, made clear that China sought a continuation of good relations despite problems between the two sides. China “cherished” relations with its neighbour, he said.“We appreciate our long relations. We will not change that attitude even though the government has changed,” he said. Myanmar can rely on China for its development, he added.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi – acting in her capacity as foreign minister among her multiple government and party roles – was asked by The Myanmar Times about the NLD’s campaign promise to disclose to the public the contract for the Myitsone hydropower project, which was suspended by U Thein Sein’s government in 2011 for the entirety of his term in office.“The Chinese foreign minister came to congratulate our new government. There was a mention of their projects but we did not discuss anything at all,” she replied during the 20-minute briefing.“I have not even read the contract, so it is difficult to show it to the people. We did not discuss anything particular in detail,” added Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who was sworn in as minister for energy and electric power on March 30 but held the portfolio for just six days before handing it to a senior bureaucrat.Mr Wang Yi expressed enthusiasm over improving economic relations through investment projects to help the country and people.“We agreed to solve issues amicably and through friendly relations,” he said.Recent commentaries in China’s state-controlled media have not hesitated to list the outstanding issues – including Myitsone, a perceived bias against Chinese investment, and repercussions of the Tatmadaw’s conflict last year with ethnic Chinese rebels in the Kokang border region.Overriding individual issues is a concern in Beijing that Myanmar – under a leader who was educated in the UK and has cultivated close ties for years with Western governments – will continue a westward shift in policy orientation that began under her predecessor.“Since Myanmar embarked on the road to democratisation in 2011, some in the West have drummed up the rhetoric that ‘China’s clout in Myanmar is waning’,” the China Daily said.“Admittedly problems have cropped up between the two countries in the past few years. China has endured economic losses when Myanmar stalled the construction of some projects,” it added, mentioning there were “some anti-China sentiments in Myanmar”.The daily said that it hoped Myanmar’s new government would respond with good will to the “positive signals” from the Chinese side, a message that a pragmatic Beijing was sending through its foreign emissary.Acutely aware of Chinese sensitivities as well as its importance as Myanmar’s biggest trading partner and a major investor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi stressed that Myanmar’s foreign policy was to have friendly relations with all countries, and that she was aware of the importance of bilateral ties with China.Mr Wang is scheduled to meet President U Htin Kyaw today, as well as other senior government officials before returning to Beijing, a Chinese diplomat said.Yun Sun, an analyst at the Stimson Center, a Washington think-tank, described Mr Wang’s visit as “really quite a show of friendliness”.“And the fact that she [Daw Aung San Suu Kyi] extended the invitation must have made China very pleased. There are many issues the Chinese want to discuss, including the peace process and economic development. We’ll see what comes out of it,” Ms Sun added.","/national-news/yangon/19857-china-pledges-support-for-new-myanmar-government.html"
"188",188,"Power sector: Lofty goals, missed targets",2016-04-01,"Business","The power sector in Myanmar over the past five years has been characterised by ambitious plans and unrealised targets. While a few power projects have been completed during the outgoing government’s term, others were suspended or cancelled and dozens more remain in limbo.          {modal url=http://www.mmtimes.com//files/images/mte/2016/di267/power-sector-map-lar...} {/modal}Myanmar remains one of the least-powered countries in Southeast Asia. Just over 30 percent of the country’s population has access to electricity, while a total of 6.8 million households across the country still need to be electrified, according to the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP).Meanwhile, the country’s energy requirements are growing fast – the government’s target of nationwide power by 2030 will involve a total capacity of 24,000 megawatts of electricity, requiring vast infrastructure investment combined with smart policymaking.Government figures suggest Myanmar has 108,000MW of hydroelectric, estimated reserves of 711 million metric tonnes of coal, 365.1 terawatt hours (TWh) per year of wind power and 51,973TWh per year of solar power. It also has 459 million barrels per day of proven oil reserves and 11.8 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves.For now, however, the country’s huge primary resources for electricity generation remain largely locked up. While the outgoing government has successfully tendered a number of oil and gas blocks, attempts to develop other power sources, particularly hydropower, have struggled to get off the ground.As a result of the lack of comprehensive laws, policies, and environmental and social protection standards, many potential power projects have become controversial. The first controversy concerns the price of electricity – K35 per KWh for household use and K75 per KWh for industry users.This is lower than the average electricity production cost of K93.67 per KWh according to the MOEP, and is costing the government billions of kyat a year in subsidies. An attempt to raise electricity prices to allow for a return on commercial investments was blocked by the Union parliament.The second controversy surrounds the implementation of large hydropower and coal-fired power projects. Presented with inadequate information about the social and environmental impacts of such projects and fearing the worst, local communities and civil society groups have generally opposed them through protests.Such resistance led to the suspension of the controversial US$3.6 billion Chinese-backed Myitsone hydropower dam, which would have generated 6000MW of electricity. The government has also signed memorandums of understanding for at least 11 coal-fired power plants across the country, but none has been able to move forward due to widespread opposition.“We have tried to explain our project to the public but they are ready to oppose it every time,” said a consultant who is working for a local company on a coal-fired power project. “We don’t get help from the government and people don’t listen. They don’t believe in government policy or what we are doing.”Last year the government cancelled a 279MW coal-fired power plant in Yangon’s Htantabin township. All the other coal projects across the country, ranging from 200MW to more than 600MW of installed capacity, are on hold.Something has to give in order for the government to achieve its target of 100pc electrification by 2030. Current electricity consumption is 2700MW, much lower than the 27,000MW used in neighbouring Thailand. Myanmar’s Energy Master Plan targets installed capacity of 4531MW in 2020, 8121MW in 2025 and 14,524MW by 2030, which will require investment of between US$30 billion and $40 billion over 15 to 20 years. Yet targets are being missed, said U Htain Lwin, permanent secretary at the MOEP.“We didn’t meet the target in the last five years because we failed to implement large-scale hydropower projects due to public opposition. The same is true of coal-fired plants as well,” he said. “It will be very difficult to meet the target if we cannot continue these large-scale projects in the next five years. Our electricity generation may stop but demand will not.”A slow start for hydro and coalJust 3000MW of an estimated 100,000MW of hydropower resources have been harnessed. Nine dams generating a total of 800MW have been completed in the past five years, but many others are on hold due to environmental and social concern. Most notable among the suspensions is the giant Myitsone dam in Kachin State.“The impact of suspending Myitsone was huge,” said an official at the electric power ministry, noting that the Chinese investor was not impressed. “We have invited other international companies [to develop hydropower] but only a few have invested. Actually only China can complete such large-scale projects,” he said.“In terms of investment, technology and logistics, no other international companies can compete with China, not only in Myanmar but globally.” In Myanmar a total of 52 hydropower projects are under development – more than 30 of which are run by at least 12 Chinese companies, the official said.Coal power in Myanmar is even less developed, though is expected to make up 20pc of total power by 2030 under the Energy Master Plan.The country has just one coal-fired power plant, a Chinese-backed 225MW project, which has been suspended due to poor regulation. The government has also signed at least 11 contracts for new coal plants with companies from China, Thailand and Japan.Yet the use of coal-power is fervently opposed by many in Myanmar, with local and international experts vociferously arguing that there is no place for the pollutant in the country’s energy mix.Co-founder of Ecodev U Win Myo Thu said, “Today, coal power is a great concern internationally as the world is looking to reduce carbon emissions due to climate change.”Others disagree – speaking at a Yangon summit hosted by The Economist last year, Asian Development Bank vice president Stephen Groff said there is a place for coal generation in Asia’s future energy supply, as long as its negative impacts are minimised.A future in gas and renewablesGas-fired power projects are the most favourable option due to their clean electricity output, but they are also the most expensive. The government has tried to meet electricity generation targets with gas over the past five years, but most of the plants are engine-based, and short-term solutions. Gas power is limited not only by cost but by a lack of supply.Myanmar’s four offshore gas fields are locked into long-term contracts with Thailand and China, and recent gas discoveries have not yet been confirmed as commercially viable. Even if they are, commercial production will take at least 10 years.“We are exporting around 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and delivering around 400 million cubic feet per day of gas for domestic use,” said U Myo Myint Oo, managing director of Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise, last year. “We have to deliver gas according to demand and we have to abide by the contracts. That’s the situation.”The government is implementing three gas-fired power plants at Thilawa in Yangon, Myingyan in Mandalay and Thaton in Mon State, with a total combined capacity of 380MW. It has also signed a memorandum of understanding for a gas-fired power plant in Thanlyin in Yangon. A consortium led by Japan’s Marubeni Corporation is conducting a feasibility study and plans to invest $1 billion into the plant, which will have a capacity of 400MW.A final option is to develop renewable energy sources. At present, there are no wind or solar power projects connected to the national grid, though the government is aiming for 9pc renewable energy by 2030. A number of solar and wind projects have been signed and are likely to come online in the next few years. US-based private equity fund ACO Investment Group and Thailand’s Green Earth Power Company are building solar projects in Mandalay and Magwe, to generate more than 500MW of electricity. More local and international companies are doing feasibility studies across Rakhine, Chin, Ayeyarwady, Yangon, Shan, Kayah, Kayin, Mon, and Tanintharyi. The MOEP estimates that wind power projects could create around 5000MW of electricity.Facing the challenges aheadSince political and economic reforms began in 2011, the government has made power generation a priority and has welcomed foreign investment to help build capacity. Since then, FDI into power has flooded in, representing 20pc of total foreign investment over the past five years. Investment from China has dominated, followed by ventures from Singapore, Thailand, the US, the UK, Japan, Norway and other Asian countries.It is likely that the new government will continue this open-door policy toward foreign investment into the power sector, yet it will need to navigate a number of unavoidable challenges. The National League for Democracy-led government, which was sworn in earlier this week, has elected to form an energy superministry, combining the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Electric Power into the Ministry of Electricity. It will be overseen by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who has taken on a total of four ministerial positions.While she may lack technical expertise, this will give her a significant role in grappling with the problem of power generation and will put her on the front line of decisions about existing divisive projects such asMyitsone, as well as future tenders related to the sector.The first area of focus should be to publicise laws, rules and regulations relating to the sector, as well as formulating new policies, experts said, adding that controversial issues surrounding the large hydro and coal projects will not go away without proper policy management.Other major reforms could include liberalising electricity prices, implementing clear standards for divisive projects, focusing more on renewable solutions, creating a profitable climate for investors and developing human resources to help strengthen the government’s regulatory capacity.The new administration, led by the NLD, will need to find ways of making power projects into success stories, said an official from the MOEP. Electrification is not only about generation but about transmission and distribution, he said.“The most important thing, above all, is policy. If we have clear guidelines we can move ahead with speed. I think the combination of two ministries is a good sign, because we have no cooperation at the moment.”The outgoing government spent more than $2.7 billion on the power sector in the past five years across generation, transmission and distribution, according to the MOEP. It also borrowed $1.69 billion from international institutions under various loan programs. Of this, only $103.9 million has been spent in the past five years, said U Khin Maung Soe, outgoing Union minister for electric power, on March 20.“The other $1.5 billion is to be spent by the next government,” he said.","/business/19790-power-sector-lofty-goals-missed-targets.html"
"189",189,"Chinese-backed condominium project launches in Yangon ",2016-03-31,"Property News","Chinese group Toener Investment has launched sales of a new five-tower condominium project in Yangon’s Yankin township known as Kanbae Towers.           Units in the development, which will be built on 2.2 acres of land on Kanbae Road, went on sale in late March. Construction began in the middle of last year and the project is slated for completion in late 2018, said sales manager Ma Win Win Phyu.Toener Investment is involved in another major residential project in the same township known as Golden City, according to the company’s website.The group was founded in 2003 in China’s Hunan province and has since expanded across the southwest of the country.Its two main businesses are mining and real estate development, according to its website, and it has projects in more than 10 provinces in China, as well as in Macao and Hong Kong, and more than 70 subsidiaries.For its latest project it has teamed up with a locally registered firm called Golden Thitsar, said Ma Win Win Phyu. The local partner is registered on the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration website under the name of a shareholder called Luo Qiong Qiong.Kanbae Towers was approved by Myanmar Investment Commission in early 2015 and will comprise three 25-storey buildings, one 21-storey building and a fifth building with 12 floors. The first and second floors of each building will be reserved for retail space and the third floors will be for recreation.In total, the project will include more than 500 units, ranging in size from 400 square feet to more than 1000 sq ft, as well as parking space for 600 cars.The price per unit will vary from US$170 to $250 per square foot, depending on the storey and the view, said Ma Win Win Phyu.“In the first phase we will only sell units between 838 and 980 sq ft but will sell different sizes at a later date,” said Ma Zin Zin, a sales representative at the showroom.Residents will be able to control units including air conditioning and other devices from their mobile phones, she said, adding, “For security, there will be four stages involved in unlocking the door – a password, key, card and phone will be involved and residents can only enter the compound using an electronic card.”","/business/property-news/19740-chinese-backed-condominium-project-launches-in-yangon.html"
"190",190,"Chinese minority to get ‘Bamar’ designation",2016-03-30,"National News","In one of his last acts in office, President U Thein Sein has instructed the Ministry of Immigration to give new identity cards to Chinese residents of northern Shan State identifying them as a Bamar group, a ministry official has confirmed.          However, the president has not ordered the group, known as the Mone Wun, be added to Myanmar’s list of 135 official “national races”, as has been reported.The Mone Wun live in the Tarmonye region of Kutkai township and are descended from immigrants from Yunnan province. They speak Chinese and maintain many Chinese customs. Prior to the president’s March 11 order, they were officially identified as Mone Wun (Chinese).The new cards will now bear the ethnicity Mone Wun (Bamar), said the senior Ministry of Immigration and Population official, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.The ministry is asking the Mone Wun Literature and Culture Association for help to identify Mone Wun eligible for the new Citizenship Scrutiny Cards, but no further steps have been taken and no new cards issued.“People are misunderstanding on the instruction. We cannot add them [Mone Wun] to the list of ethnic groups. It can only be done by the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw. This issue is like the Bengali issue. Please don’t worry that the ministry will add them without the permission of parliament,” he said on March 28, on the sidelines of a press conference in Nay Pyi Taw.The ministry official said that in 2014 some residents in Tarmonye had asked the then-minister for immigration, U Khin Yi, to help amend their race on official identity documents.The minister submitted the issue to the president, who then issued the order to amend their race “for the sake of the country” according to chapter 2 of the 1982 Citizenship Act.The Ministry of Immigration and Population estimates there are about 60,000 Mone Wun people in the Tarmonye region.It is unclear why they are being labelled Bamar when even members of the group say that they are ethnically Chinese, and many cannot speak the Myanmar language.The President’s Office declined to comment yesterday.Incoming Shan State Chief Minister U Lin Htut from the National League for Democracy told The Myanmar Times that he was aware most people opposed the president’s instruction and he planned to review it once in office.“I have heard that people do not agree to amend their name to Mone Wun (Bamar) because they are not Myanmar … We promised that it can change during the next government’s term,” he said.The group’s influence with the government stems from its links to former senior general U Than Shwe. While U Than Shwe was a soldier in Shan State, a Mone Wun militia led by U Myint Lwin helped the Tatmadaw fend off communist attacks.U Lin Htut said it was U Myint Lwin, who now serves as an MP in the Shan State Hluttaw, who requested U Than Shwe change the group’s classification to Mone Wun (Bamar).During a visit to northern Shan State in 1998, U Than Shwe reportedly said he would classify the Mone Wun as a Bamar race from Tarmonye region, the Ministry of Immigration and Population said in its instruction letter released on March 11.That year, two public opinion surveys were conducted that approved the change in ethnicity.Aside from being a sitting member of parliament, U Myint Lwin also heads Tarmonye Chan Thar company, which is engaged in manufacturing, construction and timber, according to the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration.","/national-news/19717-chinese-minority-to-get-bamar-designation.html"
"191",191,"China’s demand for human hair turns villages into trading centres",2016-03-22,"Business","In Mandalay Region, where drought and failed harvests have pushed many farmers out of business, another industry is thriving, as China’s demand for human hair has turned entire villages into centres of trade and repair.           Traders say hair is imported from India and Bangladesh through the border town of Tamu in Sagaing Region, or is collected from villages in Yangon and Mandalay regions.Villages in Pyawbwe and Thazi townships have been famous for their hair trade for some time, but the nature of the industry is changing quickly, said merchant Ko Aung Ye Thu.“In the past we travelled from one village to another collecting hair from women, but now we buy it directly from traders in Mandalay,” he said. “We repair it and sell it to wholesale traders, who take it to China.”Ko Aung Ye Thu, who has been working in the industry for more than three years, said people are increasingly drawn to the trade as a more profitable alternative to farming.Entire villages have started repairing and selling hair, he said. Hnin Kwet Aing village in Thazi township, for example, has 350 houses and 300 hair sellers.His business includes 80 staff who sell around 8 viss (13 kilograms) every day. “Depending on their capacity, employers can make between K1800 to K15,000 a day,” he said, adding that most traders make their money from untangling hair and selling it on to wholesalers. Together the villages in the two townships sell around 600 viss (980kg) per day, he said, with prices varying depending on the length of the hair. Shorter hair of around 8 inches sells at around K20,000 per viss while one viss of 38-inch strands can fetch as much as K600,000.“I once sold 50 inches of hair,” said Ko Aung Ye Thu.Ko Pyone Mg Mg, who employs 30 workers, said there are five large-scale merchants who travel around the villages, buying from small firms.“We mostly sell bags weighing 30 viss, which cost us around K5 million to put together, including expenses [such as rent and salaries]. We usually sell them for between K5.2 million and K5.3 million.”Weakness in China’s currency is a major concern and is impacting business, he said.The value of the yuan has depreciated since the start of 2014 and was trading at 6.48 to the US dollar yesterday, according to Bloomberg data, while the Central Bank of Myanmar’s reference rate showed 1 yuan costing K188.05.Waste is also a problem, said Ko Pyone Mg Mg. “If we buy 4 viss of hair, once we have finished repairing it we are usually left with around 3.80 viss.”In the past, Chinese traders relied on middlemen, but now they buy directly from central Myanmar and sell to China, or buy the raw materials and sell finished products – usually wigs – to shops in Yangon.The owner of Thiha Hair in Yangon’s Insein township opened her shop in 2006. At first she sold her products to local buyers, and did not ask where the hair ended up.“I just sold to the traders I did not know where they sent it. Now Chinese traders come directly to my shop, so I know where the hair goes. They buy from me, and also give me finished products to sell,” she said.For retail customers in Yangon, a tical (0.01 viss, or 16 grams) of short hair is priced at K10,000 and a tical of long hair sells for between K25,000 and K30,000.As the hot season begins, it is customary for young women to cut off their hair and sell it, said Thiha Hair’s owner.It is also traditional for women to shave their heads to become nuns during the Thingyan festival. From March 20 the amount of hair in the market is likely to spike, said the owner of Mhwe Mhwe San hair shop in Insein township.“I have worked in this job for 18 years. For the first three I walked around the streets and bought hair to sell to businesspeople. After three years I opened a shop and I hired other people to buy hair.”Traders sometimes try to pay in advance, she said. “I don’t accept advance money because they fix the price at less than the market price. I run the shop with my own money which allows me to negotiate. If they’re not satisfied, they don’t have to buy from me.”A few shop owners travel to China to trade directly with merchants there, but this is not easy because it requires investment. Most prefer to deal with Chinese traders who travel to Myanmar, she said.Retail buyers in Yangon are beauty salon owners, make-up artists and spirit mediums, she added.“Many of our local buyers are gay, and use the hair in their salons. I don’t know exactly what it’s used for, I think mostly for wigs.”","/business/19581-china-s-demand-for-human-hair-turns-villages-into-trading-centres.html"
"192",192,"Pat Ja San: A controversial mission",2016-03-21,"In Depth","A group of sickle-wielding vigilantes made its way through Myanmar’s northern Kachin State in January and February, clearing poppy fields nearly ready to be harvested in a quest to end production of the illicit drug. The mission turned farmers whose livelihoods were being cut down into angry and, at times, armed adversaries.           Pat Ja San’s anti-drug campaign refocused attention on a problem that has long plagued Myanmar, the second-largest producer of raw opium in the world. Though opium production in Kachin State was estimated to have decreased by 17 percent last year – from roughly 5100 hectares in 2014 to 4200ha in 2015 – it still accounts for 7.6pc of the nationwide total, according to numbers from the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime.“Each Kachin family has a problem with opium. They get angry about opium. Their families are broken and many young people have HIV,” said Reverend Samson Hkalam, general secretary of the Kachin Baptist Convention, which backs Pat Ja San.In 1999, the government of Myanmar committed to a 15-year plan to eliminate illicit crop production, but the deadline has since been extended to 2019. The consequence of this plan, according to experts, is a repressive opium eradication policy which landed many small-time drug offenders in jail and saw swathes of poppy fields eradicated. But the problem remained.The futility of these policies is most visible when the monsoon rains recede and opium poppy blossoms in the green hills of Kachin, Shan, Chin and Kayah states. With few other means of survival, the poppy farmers continue to replant their crop despite the threat of destruction.“[The farmers’] investment is probably not from their own savings but from loans. When you eradicate more you push the farmers to grow more because they need to compensate [for their losses],” said Sai Lone, a representative of the Myanmar Opium Farmers’ Forum.The farmers pay a high price. Farmers cultivate opium in mountainous areas where not many other crops will grow, or at least can’t compete with the income generated by poppy. According to a 2012 UNODC survey, the average yield of dry opium per hectare is about 19 times that of rice in mountain areas.“The large majority of opium farmers are not rich and grow it for their survival. Therefore, they should not be treated as criminals,” Myanmar opium farmers said in a statement released in September last year.Many opium-growing communities face huge challenges, particularly from drug addiction, which often tears families apart. There is a lack of rehabilitation options and counselling for drug users and limited healthcare to deal with consequences of the addiction, like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C.The volunteer drug eradicators of Pat Ja San – which loosely means “fighting against drugs” in Kachin – have become notorious for military-inspired tactics used against drug addicts. The group faced heavy criticism last year when a video was circulated on social media showing alleged members flogging addicts to deter them from using.But the group’s current eradication campaign has gained widespread local support, including from civil society groups. “We commend and support community-led anti-drugs campaign (Pat Jasan) in Kachin and Shan State as their non-violent measure is decent and targeting the common enemy of mankind conscientiously where State failed to take effective measures,” according to a recent CSO statement.Equality Myanmar, led by human rights activist U Aung Myo Min, was one of the over 200 organisations that are part of the CSO Forum that issued the statement. U Aung Myo Min told The Myanmar Times that even though he supported Pat Ja San’s goal to eradicate opium, he did not support all the means they use to achieve it. “We cannot tolerate it, despite their noble goal,” he said.He said that the statement included a clause that explained the CSOs’ position on the issue of human rights. “We recommend Pat Ja San leaders and concerned community leaders refrain from the harmful act/activities vigilantly and strongly encourage developing strategic leadership and direction,” the groups said in the statement.Experts say that Pat Ja San’s approach will disproportionally harm farmers. “UNODC does not support eradication without alternative development for the farmers,” said Troels Vester, country manager for UNODC Myanmar.“There is still much work to be done to address the underlying causes of illicit cultivation. Sustainable results in reducing illicit cultivation can only be achieved when the socio-economic conditions of communities and the livelihoods of rural households have been improved,” Mr Vester said.Sai Lone of the Myanmar Opium Farmers’ Forum warned that a crackdown on opium could also lead to an increase in the production of amphetamines. A 2009 report by the Transnational Institute refers to this phenomenon as “displacement”, “when the campaign against one drug leads to the rise of an equally or perhaps even more dangerous substitute”.“They target farmers and lose sight of the whole picture. Lots of people are involved and the problem is not just opium. Over 30 years of eradication did not work,” Sai Lone said.But previous opium-replacement programs in Myanmar, undertaken by international organisations and China, have also failed to take hold.Kachin State’s opium farmers were impoverished under China’s 2006 Opium Replacement Fund, which encouraged monocrop cultivation of mainly rubber, according to a 2012 TNI report, which describes it as “morphing what was once known as the ‘Golden Triangle’ into a ‘rubber belt’”. It said the program risked further marginalising opium-growing communities because profits ended up in the pockets of Chinese businesses, not with the farmers.Some Kachin maintain that – for the moment, at least – Pat Ja San is the community’s best hope, because the government does not do anything to stop the drug trade and its impact on communities, while the authorities are involved in the trade themselves.“This group did not come up out of nothing. They have been trying to do all these things by legal means but, if you go to the police, they are selling it themselves,” said a Kachin community leader who asked not to be identified.A week-long stand-off in January between the vigilantes and the authorities, who had first provided the group with protection and then refused to let them continue, only increased rumours about officials’ involvement in the trade.The case of Pat Ja San ended up in parliament in February, with an urgent proposal to support the anti-narcotics campaigners approved with an overwhelming number of votes.Later that month, the Kachin vigilantes – while under government protection – were attacked with stones and, reportedly, guns and grenades. Dozens of Pat Ja San volunteers were injured. The Christian anti-drug squad alleged their attackers were members of a pyithu sit, or People’s Militia Force, and the New Democratic Army-Kachin (NDA-K), an ethnic armed group that became a Border Guard Force in 2009.According to Rev Hkalam, land near the Chinese border that is controlled by the NDA-K is rented out to Chinese business-owners who then hire day labourers to grow poppy on the fields.Aid organisations working in Kachin State said the ownership of the poppy fields that Pat Ja San aimed to destroy was mixed. In some places, Chinese businesses hired local workers, and in other areas local farmers grow opium and then sell it, mostly to Chinese buyers.Most opium fields in Myanmar’s Kachin and Shan states are located in areas where government-allied militias operate. The government turns a blind eye to their involvement in the narcotics trade in return for their help to fight against the country’s plethora of ethnic armed groups.While the farmers struggle under harsh eradication campaigns, leaders or people connected to several government-sponsored militias in Shan and Kachin states were elected to parliament in the November 8 polls, including some heavily implicated in the drugs trade.“Militia leaders walk around freely and sit in parliament, while opium farmers face eradication and extortion,” said Tom Kramer, a researcher with the Transnational Institute.U Zahkung Ting Ying, a representative of the NDA-K, which was allegedly involved in the attack on Pat Ja San, is an elected Amyotha Hluttaw representative.With previous eradication campaigns seemingly futile and targeting mainly impoverished farmers, the exposure of the trade’s bigger players has made Pat Ja San’s anti-drug campaign a success, said a Kachin community leader. “They have achieved their purpose,” he said. “They have shown the world who owns the fields and who is protecting them.”","/in-depth/19566-pat-ja-san-a-controversial-mission.html"
"193",193,"NLD under pressure to scrap hydropower projects",2016-03-15,"National News","Huge hydropower projects along the Thanlwin River must be halted, civil society organisations said yesterday, in an appeal to the incoming National League for Democracy government launched from the banks of Southeast Asia’s longest free-flowing river.           Karen Rivers Watch, which has been active in campaigning against the series of more than a dozen dams planned along the river in China and Myanmar, said the projects were in breach of people’s rights and desires.An NLD official yesterday said the new government would re-examine the projects.Marking the International Day of Action for Rivers and Against Dams, a movement that began in Brazil in 1997, environmental groups in Myanmar, including in Kachin State, held events to urge the NLD-led government coming into office on April 1 to scrap power-sharing projects under negotiation with China and Thailand.The Kayin group said it was concerned that U Thein Sein’s outgoing military-backed administration had tried to accelerate agreements for the dams along the Thanlwin, also known as the Salween, including the massive Mong Ton dam, which would be the biggest in Southeast Asia by size and generating capacity.“According to the government’s Ministry of Information and other news media, the government and Chinese companies signed a memorandum of understanding for 18 hydropower projects, which has raised our concerns,” said the statement.Rights groups are worried that the new NLD government will also cave into pressure from China and authorise construction of the giant Myitsone dam in Kachin State, or possibly alternative dams on the Ayeyarwady River.A senior NLD official was quoted as saying in one media report that the NLD-led government would instruct the Chinese company involved to redesign the Myitsone dam. In September 2011 President U Thein Sein suspended the project, under public pressure, for the duration of his five-year term.The Kayin group said Chinese and Thai companies had agreed to redesign the Mong Ton hydropower project following a government request. The dam was originally designed to produce more than 7000 megawatts of electricity but would impact an estimated 120,000 people.U Tun Tun Hein, a NLD central executive committee member, told The Myanmar Times that it was too early to talk about specific details of the projects, which he said would be discussed after the formation of the new government.“We cannot decide whether to continue or not by taking a general view. We have to look into details of the projects, review the negotiations and agreements over the benefits from the planning, and then to decide whether to continue or not,” he said.The projects have been opposed widely in Shan State, in part because of the lack of transparency. In March 2015 objections were raised to an Environmental Impact Assessment and Social Impact Assessment being carried out by Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation of Australia.China Three Gorges Corporation, China Southern Power Grid and Power Construction of China, as well as the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand and Myanmar’s International Group of Entrepreneurs (IGE) are developing the Mong Ton project.China has also laid hotly contested plans to build dams along the Thanlwin, known in China as the Nu, which rises in the Tibetan plateau and crosses Yunnan province before reaching Myanmar and Thailand.“The ecosystems along the river bank would break down if they continue the projects,” said the statement by Karen Rivers Watch.Community leaders and members of the Karen National Union – which signed a nationwide ceasefire pact with the government last year – as well as local civil society organisations and refugees from Ei Htu IDP camp in Mutraw district, Kayin State, took part in events yesterday on the banks of the river near the camp.Karen Rivers Watch urged the government to find other sources of energy.“We urge the new government to consider prioritising electricity generation through micro-hydropower projects, off-grid electricity generation systems or other alternatives that are less destructive and in a way that support peace building,” the group said.In Kachin State, some 300 people, including religious leaders, took part in an event near the site of the suspended Myitsone project. They registered their opposition to recent comments attributed to China’s ambassador to Myanmar in which he said people supported the dam project and that China would seek its resumption when the NLD-led government takes office.“We are showing our disapproval of the projects. We know that this project had been opposed nationwide. This will not happen in the coming government’s term,” said Daw Ahnan, spokesperson of the Kachin Development Networking Group (KDNG).“It has also been recently reported that they are redesigning the mega-projects. We are totally against the restart plan,” she said.China’s State Power Investment Corporation, which is involved in the project, this month told a group of Myanmar reporters visiting China that the company was positive about the chances of being allowed to restart the US$3.6 billion hydropower project. SPIC official Liu Zhan said the group’s chair hoped to meet Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in May.“CPI is trying to revitalise the halted mega-projects. If this will continue, it will have unimaginable impacts on the local people and environment,” said U Tsa Ji, a member of the KDNG.More than 60 civil society groups in Kachin State called on the incoming NLD government last week to grant more freedom in management of natural resources, tax and benefits to Kachin State’s administration.","/national-news/19461-nld-under-pressure-to-scrap-hydropower-projects.html"
"194",194,"Myanmar’s jade bounty is disappearing ‘in front of our eyes’: Hpakant MP",2016-03-10,"Business","U Tint Soe, the new lower house MP for Hpakant township, discusses his frustration with Chinese lawbreakers, large-scale excavation, narcotics, landslides, environmental damage and the finite nature of jade resources.           How can the new government tackle problems in the Hpakant jade mining area?We will watch the companies and try to control them according to the laws. One important thing to note is that the jade market is terrible. A stone that used to be worth K10 million is now worth less than K1 million. Demand and supply are out of line – demand is falling but jade is being extracted from the ground with huge machines.It should not be like this. It no longer seems like companies are mining for jade, but mining for pebbles. Jade production in our country is a huge business. On the other hand, when crooks control the market in China, prices fall. Jade is not something we can re-plant, it takes millions of years to form. If we continue to extract as much as we can we will end up with nothing.We already have policies in place to protect the area, so we can try to control the companies using the existing laws.A special team including the vice minister for home affairs went to Hpakant to examine rumours that a large number of dump trucks were being brought across the border illegally. What were the results of the investigation?I was also involved in the search to find the machinery and examine the companies, as were other National League for Democracy members. I caught companies red-handed, disposing of the vehicles behind piles of tailings that they had dumped illegally. The companies said they planned to get licences, and gave excuses. Their words lacked conviction but we have been unable to do anything about it.There have been many events like this. Many companies are hiding vehicles, and we have lots of evidence. But collecting evidence is different to taking action. Our goal is to ensure proper revenues for the state. For the moment we just want to find out as much information as possible.Though I wish it did, the mining law does not include specific details about the power of machines or how many vehicles and dump trucks should be used at each work site. But with so many huge machines at the mines our supply of jade will run out quickly, that much is obvious. Each generation has a duty to preserve the things left by its ancestors. Jade mining operations are having a huge environmental impact.Do you have plans to limit the machinery used in Hpakant’s jade mines?We have to. I have been in Hpakant for 28 years. This is happening in front of our eyes. It cannot carry on indefinitely. In the past we watched and did nothing - now we need to do something. This heavy machinery can excavate as much jade in one month as 50 years of digging could produce in the past. I dare not think too hard about it. Despite all of this production, the country is still not benefiting.The only people who are benefiting, or taking profit, are foreign investors masquerading as Myanmar ethnic people. As locals, we all know about this. For example, even though we think the sales price of jade at the Myanma Gems Emporium [in Nay Pyi Taw] is expensive, we have never seen the most precious stones, which are sent illegally to China and do not reach markets in Myanmar.The priceless gems are sent to markets in places like Guangzhou, in a number of different ways. The companies can carry jade illegally because their parent companies are Chinese. We should seriously forbid this from happening, so that there are no illegal outflows from our country. I want everyone to know that the income from jade trading should be financing our country.How will you handle the illegal jade trade with China?Hpakant is the main place where the issues, difficulties and problems from the whole of Myanmar are combined. Problems with narcotics and migrant workers are inextricable from problems with jade. It is difficult to decide which one to solve first when we have to solve them all.Our main objectives are to fulfil the fundamental needs of those living nearby, to secure their lives and their properties. We have a responsibility for all of them. Particularly we must solve the problem of migrant labourers being killed when searching for raw stones. There is so much that you have not seen or heard. According to reports, 114 people died in a recent landslide. That figure conceals the real number of deaths.People from all across Myanmar travel to Hpakant to search for uncut stones and they often face death while searching through jade mine tailings. As a local Pyithu Hluttaw MP, how will you ensure such cases do not happen?Accidental death is not unusual in Hpakant. If there are one or two deaths, the police don’t even investigate. The number of deaths due to traffic accidents and landslides are too high. The main reason for this is poverty. People in such poverty who believe they can make money don’t care about the dangers they face. This is one of our challenges.We plan to do something to protect the rights of itinerant jade hunters. They should have the right to search freely. We are now working out how to reduce the height of tailings piles for their safety.How to you plan to target foreign investment under the names of Myanmar people?The responsible people from our government departments know exactly who works for which company, and who is doing what. Behind the companies are gangs and armed groups, especially those who launder drugs money. The officials know all about them, but they close their eyes, as it is also stated in the Global Witness report [published last year]. We know what is happening but we have not taken much action. It is rather difficult.How many foreigners are mining in Hpakant under the names of Myanmar people?It is difficult to say exactly. But as most people know, 95 percent of the companies here are owned primarily by Chinese investors. Even the supervisors of lower-rank workers are mostly Chinese. Only they could do that job. Chinese businesspeople join with privileged people from Myanmar – mostly officers. We see this again and again.According to our law, only Myanmar citizens can mine in Hpakant. Chinese nationals with Myanmar citizenship are running the businesses, but behind them are Chinese companies. Without doubt – some of the backers stay in the shadows, others are more visible. It is illegal. But before we do anything, we need to discuss this with all related stakeholders. So it is difficult for me to say any more about it.Do you have a plan to raise these issues in the new parliament?Yes, of course. I plan to take action as required, after negotiating with local residents and business people, or to amend or enact the necessary laws.My main intention is to settle all the problems together. If jade mining continues without any regulation in Hpakant, the precious stone will soon disappear, as it has in Mogok and Mineshu. All the locals are concerned about it.The state, civil society and local people all need to conserve this resource as their national duty. Because of the mining, local people have suffered from the environmental impact. Our region is facing climate change now. We have faced flooding and drought even though it is a land abundant in springs.

"195",195,"China hopes to resume Myitsone hydro dam ",2016-03-09,"Business","A Chinese state-owned company says it is hoping to resume a major hydropower project in Myanmar that was suspended in late 2011 by President U Thein Sein following widespread public dissent.           The director general of the department of international business at the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), Liu Zhan, said he is positive about the chances of being allowed to restart the US$3.6 billion hydropower project in Kachin State, better known as the Myitsone Dam.“I am 70 percent positive about the resumption of the project when the new government takes office,” he told a nine-member Myanmar media delegation in Beijing last week.“Now, we are trying to meet with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. We have proposed to meet her in May. Our chairman would like to meet her,” he said.State-controlled SPIC is the product of a merger last June between China Power Investment Corporation and State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation. The company has projects in 36 countries including Brazil, South Africa and Pakistan.“We have experienced problems with many projects in other countries. But we have experienced nothing like the problems in Myanmar,” Mr Liu said.“When the project was suspended Chinese people were surprised. This project is very important for bilateral relations. Actually, Myitsone is a part of China-Myanmar relations,” said the director general, who has been working for the company for 12 years.As Myanmar’s National League for Democracy-led government prepares to take office, domestic and international focus has also intensified on other major Chinese-backed projects in Myanmar including a special economic zone at Kyaukphyu and a copper mine in Sagaing Region.“It is hard to predict your government. This project will have a good impact on Myanmar. It will create 40,000 jobs and benefit Myanmar people a lot,” Mr Liu said.“You can ask a third party to evaluate the situation. It is our hope that we can push the project forward. We have followed all the rules and laws according to international standards.”The project is transparent, he said, adding that all proper discussions have been concluded. Upstream Ayeyarwady Confluence Basin Hydropower, a subsidiary of SPIC, owns 80 percent of the project. Myanmar’s government has a 15pc share and will receive 10pc of the power for free. The remaining 5pc is owned by local company Asia World.“We want stability whichever government comes to power. We have spent $800 million on the project and the interest payments on our loans are rising,” said Mr Liu, who agreed that Myitsone has been a hydro headache.“Actually, we have surplus power in China. We have proposed that Myanmar’s government takes an additional 20pc of production at the rate that China buys.”Much public opposition in Myanmar has focused on the fact that around 90pc of the power generated by the dam was to be sent directly to China. Other criticism surrounds the dam’s environmental impact and effect on local communities, which U Thein Sein alluded to when ordering the suspension.The nine-member group of journalists was invited by the Chinese embassy in Yangon to observe the fourth session of the 12th National People’s Congress (NPC) on March 5. The visit to SPIC’s office was part of the program.Confirming Mr Liu’s stance, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a news conference on the sidelines of the NPC that China is pursuing efforts to resolve the problem of the stalled project, Reuters reported yesterday.“Difficulties in cooperation are ‘growing pains’. Both countries will continue to proactively appropriately handle it,” said Mr Wang. “We have confidence in the future of Sino-Myanmar mutually beneficial cooperation.”","/business/19377-china-hopes-to-resume-myitsone-hydro-dam.html"
"196",196,"Transforming Myitsone into a win-win",2016-03-04,"Opinion","The incoming National League for Democracy government will soon need to make important decisions about the controversial Myitsone Dam.           But it will also have to decide whether and how to harness the considerable opportunities for hydropower generation that exist in Myanmar, where less than one-third of the population has access to electricity.On September 30, 2011, President U Thein Sein announced his decision to suspend the China-backed Myitsone until the end of his term, declaring the project was “against the will of the people”. Since that time there has been recurrent speculation over what will happen after the president’s term ends.The dam’s Chinese developer, China Power Investment Corporation (CPI), has been lobbying for a restart of the project, while Myanmar’s civil society and the population at large, emboldened by the NLD victory in last November’s election, remain firmly against a resumption.However, Myanmar has an urgent need to generate power for electrification to support much-needed economic and social development. It also has, at least at the political level, a well-understood necessity to maintain friendly relations with its big neighbour to the east.How to turn this dilemma into a win-win situation?As much as Myanmar needs good relations with China, the need also goes the other way. The situation has become a “dilemma of mutual dependence” as professor David Steinberg and Hongwei Fan term it in their 2012 volume, Modern China-Myanmar Relations.Chinese companies such as CPI and Three Gorges Project Corporation, the latter involved in the hugely unpopular Mong Ton Dam on the Thanlwin River, may be less concerned about public opposition to the projects they are involved in.But the Chinese government cannot afford a strained relationship with Myanmar. That was underscored when Foreign Minister U Wunna Maung Lwin visited China in October 2011 to ease tensions over the suspension of the Myitsone Dam construction.He met with then vice president Xi Jinping who urged the two sides to settle all relevant matters through friendly consultations. According to notes from the meeting, Xi Jinping did not call for reactivation of the Myitsone project.It is safe to assume that a mutual understanding exists between the two countries to maintain good neighbourly relations. Permanent cancellation of Myitsone would incur a loss for the developer, CPI, which may need to be compensated.But conducted successfully, it could be a big public relations win for both the Chinese and Myanmar government.China would be seen as willing to listen to Myanmar people’s concern over projects implemented in the country by Chinese companies. The NLD government would live up to its promise of change, proving itself a government of the people, as the rhetoric goes. If handled skillfully, this could also create a more accommodating public attitude towards hydropower in the country.The past approach to hydropower has not been particularly strategic except for an interest in maximising investment.Projects meeting international standards for environmental and social safeguards, including opportunities for affected communities to be heard, have been the exception rather than the rule.That has contributed to building strong public opposition to the Myitsone and Mong Ton dams, both mega- projects. It has also turned many local civil society organisations against the development of hydropower in the country more broadly.The NLD government will have to develop its own approach fairly soon as hydropower is one of the key economic resources it can harness for development, and one of the main sources of conflict it needs to bring under control.Saying “no” to the massive Myitsone and Mong Ton projects does not have to mean saying “no” to all hydropower opportunities in Myanmar.When done the right way, hydropower, together with solar and wind, could be an attractive option for sustainably generating much-needed electricity for national consumption and the possible export of surplus.Not all hydropower dams are the same. Because of their location, some dams will have a much higher impact on communities and rivers than others. For example, a dam that severs an important fish migration path will have impacts that may be felt by communities throughout a river basin.Basin-wide, or even country-wide, river network thinking may help in prioritising certain locations over others or support the development of mitigation plans.Taking a holistic look at the river system is also economically advisable because multiple dams have a cumulative impact, not just on the environment but also on energy performance.The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the World Wildlife Fund are developing models to compare different hydropower scenarios in Myanmar in terms of their costs and benefits across a range of resources and values.Initial results indicate that some options for hydropower development have much lower impact than others. This approach to better planning provides ways to find better options that can still meet a country’s electricity needs, at the lowest possible costs.This is Myanmar’s opportunity to move beyond ad hoc decisions about single dams, and start a process of coordinated long-term planning to meet its energy needs while preserving the precious natural and cultural heritage of its river systems.There are thousands of megawatts of potential hydropower sites in Myanmar that any government can hardly afford not to consider for development. However, if not well planned, the impact from large dams on fisheries and agriculture, and thus the livelihoods of poor rural people, could be substantial.On an individual project level, it is the responsibility of the developers to prove no harm. Proper environmental and social impact assessment and public consultations must be undertaken prior to detailed planning and decision making.Negative side effects on communities living up-stream or down-stream of dams must be minimised and properly compensated.Hydropower has a negative reputation in many countries, not only Myanmar.This is often due to inadequate preparations by the developers, in particular a lack of public consultation and participation where indigenous people have lost their natural habitat without getting much in exchange, sometimes not even the electricity produced.But there are also examples where this renewable energy is being produced and used and even exported to neighboring countries without causing serious problems.In Norway, one of the countries in the world with the highest standard for social equality and environmental protection, the entire population has access to electricity generated by hydropower, with surplus production exported to neighbouring Denmark and Sweden and beyond.Conflicts over hydropower have been much reduced since the country developed a comprehensive masterplan in the 1980s, to decide which projects were in the best public interest and which rivers should be protected.From the foothills of Himalaya to the Andaman Sea, the Ayeyarwady River passes through Kachin State and the Sagaing, Mandalay, Magwe, Bago, Yangon and Ayeyarwady regions.With an increasing population, dependent on the river and its resources, and with the impact from intensified agriculture, from industrialisation and from climate change, competition for use of this natural resource will inevitably intensify.To promote sustainable use of the river and attain maximum, equal benefit for all people, a permanent Ayeyarwady River Commission, with representation from the state and regions the river passes through, could help make balanced decisions on development projects.It could contribute to avoiding conflicts in the future, such as the one over the Myitsone Dam. The commission would be the focal point for government decision making, negotiation and public participation in managing developments related to the river.Joern Kristensen is executive director of the Yangon-based Myanmar Institute for Integrated Development. A former director general of the Mekong River Commission and director of UNODC’s programs in Southeast Asia, he has been engaged with economic and social development in Myanmar for more than two decades.","/opinion/19328-transforming-myitsone-into-a-win-win.html"
"197",197,"NLD to scrutinise special economic zones ",2016-03-01,"Business","As speculation mounts over whether the new government will back Myanmar’s divisive special economic zones, a National League for Democracy spokesperson says in theory such projects are good for the economy and will continue to receive support.           However, the party will need to scrutinise details before deciding whether or not individual projects have a future, said U Han Thar Myint, a member of the NLD economic committee.Of the three SEZs conceived by Myanmar’s outgoing administration, two have stalled amid much controversy. Managed well, special economic zones can benefit an economy, allowing innovative policies to be tested in a controlled area and boosting investment.Over the past few years, despite the hype surrounding all three projects, only Japanese-backed Thilawa SEZ near to Yangon has made any real progress. The other two zones – Thai-funded Dawei SEZ in Tanintharyi Region and Chinese-backed Kyaukphyu SEZ in Rakhine State – have been delayed for a number of reasons including local opposition and a lack of funding.U Han Thar Myint of the NLD’s economic committee said it is too early to take a stance on their future.It is clear that the project in Thilawa has been a success, he said, but the NLD does not yet have detailed information about the zones in Dawei and Kyaukphyu, as the relevant ministries have not handed over project documents.“Until we have the details and figures about the SEZs under development we cannot form a plan,” he told The Myanmar Times. “But there are many examples of successful special economic zones in other countries that prove they can be very useful for Myanmar.”The NLD will need to study commitments made by the former government to investors, and speak with the relevant state and regional governments and local residents, before deciding whether the projects in Dawei and Kyaukphyu should continue, he said, adding that a balanced and informed choice will be made.Ko Zaw Aung, a freelance social researcher, said that civil society groups have opposed the projects because of their negative effect on local residents, adding that local people should be treated fairly and supported by the government. More equitable policies and laws could improve public sentiment about the zones, he added. “The new government has been highly recommended by the people, so its policies and laws will be better than those set by the old government. I am optimistic, and hoping to see many good things.”Ichiro Maruyama, minister-counsellor at the Japanese embassy, said Thilawa could be used as an example for developing the other two zones. Thilawa’s proximity to Yangon meant it was a priority, he said, adding that Japan is now in discussions to help fund the project in Dawei.Dawei SEZ was originally designed to be one-quarter the size of Singapore, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and generating up to 5 percent of Myanmar’s GDP. However, approvals and funding have proved challenging, as has winning local support.Work began on the initial phase last year, almost a decade after the original MoU was signed. U Han Sein, the chair of Dawei SEZ Management Committee, said he hoped the new government would allow the project to continue. “This is our first experience of a new government, but we believe it will support projects started by the old government. SEZs help countries to develop, and should be built regardless of who is in power,” he said.The zone in Kyaukphyu will be developed by China’s CITIC. U Aung Kyaw Than, joint secretary of the Kyaukphyu SEZ tender evaluation committee, said he believes the project will continue, as new parliamentarians have a responsibility to uphold commitments made by the former government.However, a report published by BMI Research last week said its development will be disrupted by security risks. “Looming ... risks stemming from ongoing ethno-religious tensions, environmental concerns and opposition to Chinese investment, will plague the construction of the SEZ and threaten its future success,” the report said.“While CITIC has made promises about how the SEZ will benefit the local community … past Chinese investment projects have shown that Chinese companies prefer to bring their own workers and their projects may not bring significant benefits for local communities.”","/business/19240-nld-to-scrutinise-special-economic-zones.html"
"198",198,"Parliament urges enquiry into last-minute rush for lucrative deals",2016-02-26,"Property News","The National League for Democracy called yesterday for an immediate investigation into a recent wave of lucrative business deals that have seemingly been fast-tracked by officials in the outgoing government.           Daw Khin San Hlaing, National League for Democracy Pyithu Hluttaw MP for Pale township, put forward an urgent proposal advising the current government to scrutinise an apparent fire-sale of assets, including land and projects by ministries and state-owned enterprises, in the period between the election and the handover of power.“While the government needs to prioritise the power transfer, some ministries in the Union government and certain members of regional governments have fast-tracked activities without the necessary arrangements and negotiations, before handing over to the new administration,” she said, adding that such cases have become increasingly common in the months following last year’s election.Examples include a deal between the Ministry of Health and Malaysian healthcare group IHH to build a hospital on a 4.3-acre site in downtown Yangon under build-operate-transfer terms, and Ministry of Industry factories that had been privatised over the past six months, she said.She also outlined a recent decision to award “prime land owned by the state” to a number of local and international developers, as a substitute for land near to Shwedagon Pagoda that was confiscated last year, following public opposition to the original location.In particular, she flagged up an agreement between the Ministry of Science and Technology and Hong Kong-based developer Marga Landmark for a 17.7-acre site beside Yangon’s Inya Lake. Marga Landmark and IHH have both received Myanmar Investment Commission approval for their projects.Parliament also heard that the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology is planning a 2600-megahertz spectrum auction before the end of March, while a roadmap for managing the resource has not been finalised.Myanmar’s multinational mobile operators, Telenor and Ooredoo, have also raised concerns about this spectrum sale, while local internet service provider Redlink has denied the plan to auction has been rushed.Daw Khin San Hlaing also pointed to the Ministry of Electric Power’s controversial acceleration of plans to build dams on the Thanlwin River. On February 2, the government gave the green light to 18 out of 29 hydropower projects planned by Chinese companies in Myanmar. Environmental network Save the Salween said earlier this week that the plans had been made “without information or consulting Burma’s citizens”.The Ministry of Energy is also in the process of privatising its 70 remaining petrol stations, Daw Khin San Hlaing said. This is seemingly at odds with a ministry announcement last year that it would increase its presence in the fuel retail market. The ministry is also preparing to grant industrial zone permits for 272.15 acres in the watershed area around Pwin Oo Lwin’s National Kandawgyi Park, she said.Other contentious projects such as the Yangon Region government’s new city developments have also been accelerated without approval from parliament, Daw Khin San Hlaing said, adding that preparations are under way for operations to resume at a controversial copper mine in Letpadaung, Sagaing Region, the site of repeated clashes between local residents and activists and government troops and police. Chinese company Wanbao is preparing to re-start activity without properly reviewing the report compiled by an investigation commission set up by the government in the wake of a violent police crackdown last year, she said.She concluded by saying that over the past few months, squatters have been forcibly evicted from their homes without sympathy or compensation, adding, “I could point to many more such examples”.“It is significant that during the power transfer, these cases have not paved a smooth path for the new government,” said U Tin Tin Naing, Pyithu Hluttaw MP for Yangon’s Seikkyi Khanaungto township, who seconded the proposal. “I believe they will become a challenge and a burden for the next government.”A vote to continue debating the proposal saw 278 vote in favour, 132 against and three abstaining.Meanwhile, a representative of the incumbent government said he was interested as to why the urgent proposal was being submitted now.“[The urgent proposal] came to parliament while we are trying to cooperate with each other to ensure a smooth transition. It raises questions for us that it has come up during this critical period,” U Soe Htay, deputy director general of the President’s office, told Radio Free Asia yesterday. “If they want to know, they can ask the related departments. If asked, the ministry can reply by letter or can come to parliament to offer an explanation.”Translation by Thiri Min Htun","/business/property-news/19191-parliament-urges-enquiry-into-last-minute-rush-for-lucrative-deals.html"
"199",199,"First we take Havana, then Vientiane",2016-02-25,"Opinion","President Barack Obama of the United States will travel to Cuba next month. He will be only the second sitting American leader to visit the island.           Later, in September, he will visit Laos and become the first sitting US president to visit that landlocked nation.There is some puzzlement over why he will travel to two of the world’s most repressive communist states, which not only have minimal ties with the US, but have traditionally been anti-American.The singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen might be able to come up with a tuneful answer, but most folks, and not just redneck Donald Trump groupies, have been having a hard time sussing out the motive.Congressman Ed Royce, the foreign affairs committee chair, decried the planned visit to “a communist regime that brutalises its people”.“When President Obama lands in Havana, how will he stand up for human rights?”Probably in the same decorous way that he will stand up for human rights when he lands in Vientiane, the capital of a similarly hard-line communist regime that brutalises its people.Perhaps that’s unfair. Nowadays, neither Cuba nor Laos brutalises its people in the same way as the US brutalised detainees at its Guantanamo Bay naval base.And remember that Mr Trump and other leading Republican candidates to replace Obama want to ramp up that kind of brutalismo treatment.That said, Cuba and Laos do suppress human rights and refuse to permit any moves toward a multi-party democracy.They also rigorously control the media and lock up pushy journalists – as well as academics and NGO leaders – for re-education; some, like the renowned Lao community leader Sombath Somphone, never return.But, hey, it’s par for the course in this region, as shown by the countries bordering Laos, like China and Vietnam, which are also authoritarian one-party communist regimes that brook no dissent.Thailand is now ruled by a stern military junta, which, as a commentary in the Bangkok Post noted on February 23, “is quickly losing its mandate as its rule has unravelled into a state of incompetency and disarray”.Only Cambodia and Myanmar can claim to be fledgling democracies, and that remains just a claim for the moment.However, unlike Cuba, no one in the US Congress cares a fig about Laos and there will be no pressure on Obama to lecture its leaders about parliamentary democracy.He will make reference to that noble goal, of course, but it’s not the reason for his visit, which, in a formal sense, is because Laos is the 2016 ASEAN chair and he wants to attend the group’s summit meetings.Aside from basking in a final curtain call, he will also have a far more substantive motive for his trip. A quick glance at the recent history of Laos helps explain why.First, it must be recalled that until recently, Laos was a client state of Vietnam.In the quarter-century after the Vietnam People’s Army propelled their Lao comrades into power in 1975, no decision has been taken in Vientiane that was not first approved by Hanoi.Often, in fact, the decision was first made in Hanoi.But gradually, a resurgent China muscled into Laos and started to usurp much of Vietnam’s influence, especially after Beijing rescued the Lao currency, the kip, in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.However, becoming a dominant mentor has a downside, and as happened in Myanmar, the mass influx of Chinese companies and workers, especially in northern Laos, caused an upsurge of anti-China sentiment.The animosity grew as large tracts of land were fenced off and became de facto Chinese territory within Laos, while local peasants hired for mines and plantations were poorly paid and treated as chattel labour.Concurrently, Chinese property conglomerates moved into Vientiane, Pakse, Luang Prabang and Savannakhet, and built commercial centres, shopping malls and hotels, diminishing the local ambience.In December, the Chinese began work on a US$7 billion high-speed railway that will bisect Laos and link Kunming in southern China with Bangkok. Economists say it will be of dubious benefit to Laos.Whether hostility caused by Beijing’s perceived economic takeover was a factor is unclear, but there was a violent bomb blast near a military camp in central Laos on January 24 which killed two Chinese mine workers.The incident coincided with a leadership congress held by the ruling Lao People’s Revolutionary Party at which the pro-Beijing party leader and the prime minister were replaced by figures viewed as more internationalist.The new party boss Bounnhang Vorachit has openly signalled a desire to reverse the swing toward China, while the new PM Thongloun Sisoulith has sought closer ties with ASEAN, as well as the US and Japan.Thongloun, who will greet Obama in September, has already held one-on-one talks with the US Secretary of State John Kerry when the latter visited Vientiane last month.Later, there were meetings at the recent Sunnylands US-ASEAN Summit and the February 8 signing of a US-Lao bilateral trade and investment agreement, which put the icing on a spiffy new $145 million US embassy in Vientiane.So things are moving fast and Obama clearly wants to seize the moment.The shift in Lao sentiment was clearly implicit in Kerry’s comment that Thongloun’s team had told him they want “a unified ASEAN” that seeks to “avoid militarisation and conflict” in the South China Sea.It is apparent that the new Lao leadership, which has become tired of being taken for granted and left sucking at the hind tit in regional affairs, will use its year in the chair to exert a more forceful balancing role.That is where an opportunity has opened up for Washington and it is the key reason for Obama’s visit.The country may be a sleepy backwater, but it has the potential to be a game-changing referee in the South China Sea imbroglio.","/opinion/19159-first-we-take-havana-then-vientiane.html"
"200",200,"China deploys missile as US, ASEAN leaders discuss",2016-02-18,"National News","On the second day of the US-ASEAN summit, leaders at the Sunnylands resort in California put their heads together to formulate a common stance on the conflicting claims laid on islands in the South China Sea. The topic, which pits China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia on opposing sides, has long been a delicate issue among ASEAN nations, not least for Myanmar, which wants to remain neutral.          For some time, the US has tried to convince the ASEAN nations to take a stronger position on the islands dispute, and against China’s handling of the problem. But the economic dependency of some ASEAN countries which rely on the powerful nation to the north have long made a unified, opposing stance unlikely.“If past experience serves as any indicator, ASEAN cannot grow out teeth against China overnight,” Yun Sun, a senior associate with the East Asia Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center, said.The summit was a thorn in the eye of China which was “certainly concerned that the summit might have some components that undermine China’s interests”, Ms Sun said.A joint statement released after the conference referred to China only indirectly. It reaffirmed a shared commitment to the “peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force”, an indirect reference to the aggressive positioning of China in response to the conflict so far.But Mr Obama spoke strongly against the militarisation of the islands, and said “tangible steps” were needed to ease tensions. Just hours later, reports surfaced that Beijing had deployed missile launchers on an island also claimed by Vietnam.Tang Xiaoyang, associate professor at the Department of International Relations of Tsinghua University in Beijing and resident scholar at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, defended China’s actions. “I think that the narrative should be reversed. It’s an understandable diplomatic activity to protect China’s interest in the dispute. But the US as an external power joined the dispute and exerted its influence on ASEAN countries to counter China. China is unhappy about this,” he said.China has often perceived the US as working its way into its backyard and in Myanmar especially since a quasi-civilian government replaced the former junta in 2012. Open to foreign investment and no longer a pariah to the West, Myanmar began to rely less on China.Anti-Chinese sentiment became prominent after public protests were no longer completely outlawed and at least two large Chinese investments – a copper mine in central Myanmar and a multi-billion-dollar hydropower dam in Kachin State – came under increased pressure from the public to be halted. It was no longer self-evident that China would continue to win large contracts.“Newcomers also need to understand and respect the indigenous culture and tradition in Myanmar. Some Chinese firms neglected this issue and paid a high price for it,” said Mr Xiaoyang.The copper mine project came under parliamentary scrutiny after a group of protesting monks were allegedly attacked with white phosphorus by the Myanmar Police Force, injuring them severely and leaving horrible burns on their bodies. Daw Aung San Suu Kui, who was appointed to head the commission investigating the mine project, sided with the Chinese and let the project continue.Her warming to China, likely a strategic decision to maintain good relations with Myanmar’s powerful neighbour, has raised questions about her upcoming foreign policy strategy.While the US may expect relations to warm between the two countries as the democracy icon takes the helm, China may see things differently, according to Ms Sun.“[In China], they believe that [Daw]Aung San Suu Kyi, as a pragmatist and a nationalist, will have more opportunities not to see eye-to-eye with the US. Combined with her need for national reconciliation and economic development and China’s readily available resources to assist in both processes, they believe that [she] will make the correct choice between the US and China,” she said.Despite a waning influence in the country, observers say that China still has a strong hold over ethnic armed groups active in Myanmar’s border lands and have alleged that it was due to pressure from China that President U Thein Sein’s nationwide ceasefire agreement was not all what its name suggests.In his closing speech on the last day of the summit, Mr Obama expressed his intention to continue to work closely with Myanmar on a ceasefire agreement and on national reconciliation. “We will sustain our engagement with the people of Myanmar,” he said.","/national-news/19045-china-deploys-missile-as-us-asean-leaders-discuss.html"
"201",201,"Australia-based mining company granted three blocks",2016-02-11,"Business","Australian PanAust Group has been granted exploration licences for three mining blocks in Myanmar, becoming the first foreign firm to receive the green light after a new mining law was passed last December.           A subsidiary of Chinese state-owned Guangdong Rising Assets Management, PanAust will have the right to explore and produce mineral resources in Hel Chain, Pin Hin Hka and Nam Awl in Sagaing Region.The company’s Myanmar subsidiary, Wuntho Resources, will build a package of tenements covering 1400 square kilometres in the project’s first phase.Sagaing is considered highly prospective for copper and gold, the company said.“We are one of the first and certainly the largest ‘Western’ company to have been granted an exploration licence in Myanmar,” said PanAust managing director Fred Hess.“Our focus for the upcoming year is to carry out geochemical sampling and mapping to identify potential drill targets by year end.”The company will establish a permanent office in Banmauk township in upper Myanmar and will continue to consider other potential exploration opportunities, he said.PanAust holds an 80 percent interest in Myanmar-registered Wuntho Resource, while Myanmar Energy Resources Group International (MERG) holds the other 20pc.The Ministry of Mines has granted 2410 licences for mining projects up to 2015, most of which are localised small-scale projects that use traditional mining methods.“Currently only five of the 15 foreign investments into mining are in the production stage. The other 10 are in the study period,” said U Win Htein, director general of the Department of Mines under the mining ministry.The ministry had approved 2770.81 square kilometres of land for mining projects until the end of the 2015 financial year.A total of 63 mineral commodities have been recorded in over 2000 locations around the country according to the Department of Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration under the Ministry of Mines.The Union parliament approved a new mining law in December 2015, though new rules and regulations have not yet been drafted.Foreign investment into the mining sector was US$2.9 billion up to the end of May 2015 according to the Myanmar Investment Commission.However, until the new law was passed last December, foreign investment was limited to large companies. This restriction, along with myriad other factors, stymied foreign interest. Last fiscal year, FDI into mining was just $6.2 million through a single project, compared with $3.22 billion into the oil and gas sector.Wuntho Resources has been looking for projects over the past two years, including in Sagaing Region, director Richard Taylor previously told The Myanmar Times. “Wuntho Resources is determined to start off on the right foot here in Myanmar,” he said in an emailed statement, adding that the company will look for ways to partner with stakeholders such as NGOs and local communities.This will be important – in the past, mining companies in Sagaing Region have clashed with local residents over a wealth of issues, including a lack of transparency, land use and environmental damage.","/business/18926-australia-based-mining-company-granted-three-blocks.html"
"202",202,"Surging kyat closes foreign exchange desks  ",2016-02-10,"Business","Local banks suspended foreign currency exchange services yesterday as the kyat surged in value against the dollar, with financial industry sources variously pointing the finger at political speculation, market rumours and a lack of clear Central Bank policy.           The kyat strengthened to K1248 against the dollar yesterday, according to the Central Bank’s rate, after ending January at K1294.Moves among money changers were even more severe, with one shop in downtown Yangon quoting K1190 to the dollar yesterday, and another K1210. The same foreign exchange agents were buying dollars at over K1300 at the start of this year.The sharp moves are causing headaches for banks, several of which opted yesterday to stop exchanging dollars into kyat. Staff at downtown branches of Kanbawza Bank and AYA Bank told The Myanmar Times yesterday that the foreign exchange desks at all their branches were closed on orders from head office, and could not say when they would be reopened.KBZ vice president U Than Lwin said his firm’s foreign exchange services were suspended rather than closed, and that this was due to a shortage of kyat. The bank would be following events, he said, but could not comment on when the suspension would end.A staff member at a downtown branch of CB Bank said his foreign exchange desk had been open on-and-off throughout the day as the exchange rate between kyat and dollars shifted.“When a customer came into the bank and asked to sell or buy dollars we called head office to ask for the price,” he said. “But the wait was too long and so no-one has exchanged money today.”Myanmar Oriental Bank’s chair U Mya Than said his firm would continue to change money for tourists, but would not be changing large amounts. Asia Green Development Bank’s deputy managing director U Soe Thein said ADG was not interested in accepting more US dollars in foreign currency transactions, and that this was widespread across the banking sector.“The banks are not willing to take more [currency] risk,” he said.Commercial bank officials were unanimous in deeming the situation extraordinary, but there was less agreement over what was causing the strengthening kyat.U Mya Than said he had questioned his staff, who had suggested Chinese New Year had lowered demand for dollars.One Yangon-based official at an international financial institution also suggested the drop in imports from China during the holiday could be pushing down demand for dollars.But historical data from the Central Bank shows little sign of any fluctuations ahead of earlier Chinese New Year breaks.The exchange rate was K1025 to the dollar at the end of January 2015, and had only moved to K1206 when Chinese New Year arrived on February 19 of that year, according to Central Bank data. The previous year tells a similar story, when the exchange rate was the same on January 2 and January 31, the day of Chinese New Year.Bankers also pointed out that Myanmar’s currency is not alone in performing well against the dollar, although the 3.55 percent shift in the kyat-dollar exchange since the end of January eclipses most moves elsewhere in Asia.The Thai baht strengthened 0.83pc against the dollar over the same period and the Singapore dollar 2.09pc. The Japanese yen, however, has strengthened 4.7pc against the dollar during the same period, according to the Bank of Japan.Both Chinese New Year and the broader weakening of the dollar against regional currencies are potential factors, bankers said. But sources at several commercial banks said rumours are also likely playing a role.“The Myanmar market is covered with rumours,” said one, who suggested people were “betting on politics” by changing dollars in large amounts in the expectation that the new government will liberalise the economy.U Mya Than said he had heard rumours of people selling out of offshore dollar positions, again in expectation that the outlook for Myanmar was becoming more favourable. But he doubted that this was driving the strengthening kyat.KBZ’s U Than Lwin said that there was still demand for dollars across the financial sector, but that banks would not dare take on more dollars while the market was expecting further drops.One local economist pointed out that if commercial banks were expecting the kyat to appreciate further, they would be offering their dollars to the Central Bank at auction. But Central Bank auction results show no signs of commercial banks submitting offers for dollars, only bids.“That means that the banks do not believe in a downward trend for the dollar against the kyat,” he said.AGD Bank’s U Soe Thein also felt there was little reason for the kyat to appreciate further.“We still have the trade deficit,” he said. “I think it’s that the banks are holding too much foreign currency, and when you hold more foreign currency you need more kyat and they don’t have enough.”A clearer Central Bank policy for foreign exchange would help, he said. Central Bank policy makes it difficult for banks to use dollars held physically, rather than electronically, for import financing or interbank transfers, he said.For this reason, commercial banks would be willing to take on more dollars in their nostro accounts – held in a foreign country and denominated in the currency of that country – but not in physical form at a branch, U Soe Thein said.“There’s also the issue of the foreign exchange [that] we and other banks hold with the Central Bank, Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank and Myanma Foreign Trade Bank,” he said. “There’s no clear policy about how we can use those dollars. A clearer idea of central policy guidelines would help the interbank foreign exchange market.”U Win Thaw, head of the Central Bank’s Foreign Exchange Management Department, said the Central Bank was “monitoring and looking at the situation” but could not discuss the currency movements.","/business/18902-surging-kyat-closes-foreign-exchange-desks.html"
"203",203,"Rice farmers need government support: federation ",2016-02-09,"Business","Polices set by the new government will determine the success of Myanmar’s rice industry, which is in dire need of funding, according to the Myanmar Rice Federation.           The agricultural staple will depend heavily on government support over the coming years, said MRF president U Chit Khine at the federation’s annual meeting on February 5, where he presented industry challenges and concerns, and advice on developing the sector.U Chit Khine said the MRF has been pushing the government to legislate rice policy since the federation was founded in 2009, and is hoping the new National League for Democracy-led government will pass policies to support the sector.Myanmar was once considered the “rice bowl” of Asia and has the potential to become a major exporter, but this will require investment.“We need financing and a budget to develop the rice sector,” U Chit Khine said. “At the most basic level, infrastructure constraints can only be solved with a government budget.”Myanmar is ranked 145 out of 160 countries in the World Bank’s 2014 Logistics Performance Index – the lowest score in Asia.Next year’s budget has already been passed, but once the new government takes power in March, U Chit Khine said the budget should be raised, or relevant ministries should collaborate to change the composition of the agriculture budget. “To draw up a rice policy, we need to collect data on plantation area, local consumption and exports. For now we are still working with estimates,” he said.U Chit Khaing, who is known for his wide-ranging business interests, said he would step down as MRF president in 2017 but would continue to support the rice sector by setting up a non-government organisation.MRF vice president U Soe Tun said expectations should not be too high. “The main thing is the budget, which the previous parliament has already decided for the coming financial year. We need to wait and see whether the new government will try to change that,” he said.If the government can pass new laws and procedures to help develop the sector, it would be very helpful, U Soe Tun said.In the National League for Democracy’s election manifesto the party said it would focus on agricultural reform, drawing on modern ideas and practices and providing assistance to enable small-holder farmers to increase productivity.In “suitable regions” the party said it would encourage mechanised farming, and said it would prioritise agricultural research. “We will encourage and support the expanded production of export-quality crops, including rice that can compete on price and quality in the international market.”The party also said it would prioritise protection against flood risks, and would identify fallow, vacant and virgin lands suitable for agriculture and distribute them to landless people, providing them with legal ownership rights.Finally, the NLD said it would “systematically establish an accurate land registry system, and work to ensure easy access to land records”.This would help encourage more foreign investment into the sector. While agriculture, manufacturing and infrastructure are three “priority” sectors promoted by the Myanmar Investment Commission, due to vague land policies and outdated infrastructure agriculture brings in less than 1 percent of total foreign investment.At the MRF meeting, secretary general U Ye Min Aung said the government should not overspend over the coming year, as the budget has already been approved, but that it will need to raise the budget in fiscal year 2018.U Aung Than Oo, MRF vice president, presented a report suggesting that Myanmar relies too much on China for exports.While China dominates Myanmar’s rice trade, these exports are not yet legal – Chinese officials are still negotiating quotas and taxes with Myanmar’s Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation.Once the discussions are complete, legal shipments can leave Myanmar through the Straits of Malacca to the Chinese ports. For now, rice is smuggled overland into China’s Yunnan province through Muse in Shan State.For now, Chinese authorities turn a blind eye to the trade, but if China was to enforce rules banning Myanmar rice imports it would pose a serious threat to the local market, U Aung Than Oo said.This financial year, 840,804 metric tonnes of rice have been sold across the Chinese border, or 93pc of total exports, he said.","/business/18886-rice-farmers-need-government-support-federation.html"
"204",204,"Kyat appreciates as imports slow ahead of Chinese New Year",2016-02-05,"Business","As trade and other businesses wind down in the run-up to the Chinese New Year festival, and sentiment about the political transition improves, the kyat has strengthened in value to a three-month high against the US dollar.          The value of Myanmar’s currency has fallen more than 25 percent to the dollar over the past year, but since January has strengthened by 2pc, to K1280 yesterday according to the Central Bank rate. Money changers in Yangon were buying dollars yesterday at K1266.Myanmar’s fast-widening trade and current account deficits, a stronger US dollar and devastating flooding last year combined to place downward pressure on the currency. Flooding also caused the price of basic commodities to soar and inflation to rise well into the double digits.Sources said import transactions such as payment for automobiles had slowed, and demand for US dollars had fallen since last week. Many of Myanmar’s largest trade partners including China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan are preparing for the week-long holiday.Exports across Myanmar’s land border with Yunnan province, particularly watermelons, are at an annual high as China stocks up on food.Confidence in the kyat has been boosted by a relatively smooth political transition, to a government that is expected to benefit the economy and welcome foreign investment, financial industry sources said.The Central Bank tried to prop up the weakening currency last year, and took a number of measures aimed at boosting confidence, but was finally unable to stem its decline.U Mya Than, chair of Yangon Foreign Exchange Market Committee, said the Central Bank does not have sufficient foreign currency reserves to intervene effectively.“The Central Bank cannot control the market as they can’t offer enough [US dollars] to the banks,” he said. In its daily auctions, the monetary authority can sell up to US$1 million while banks place orders for $14 million to $15 million, he said.In yesterday’s auction, nine banks bid for a total of $12 million at K1280 and the Central Bank sold $200,000, leaving $11.8 million of unsatisfied demand, according to Central Bank records. Banks typically carry out their own surveys to ascertain the kyat’s market value before bidding each day, said U Mya Than.“While the Central Bank has not been able to intervene in the market, its recent policies seem to have helped counter currency depreciation,” he said. A weaker US dollar since the end of last month has also helped.In particular, two recent policies may have helped support the currency, said a Yangon-based economist.The first is that exporters and importers must now use banks for all foreign currency transactions. The rule, introduced in December, is aimed at paving the way for a functioning interbank currency market.The government also amended its 2012 Foreign Exchange Management Law in December to prevent exporters from selling foreign currency. The amendment also requires lenders with foreign exchange licences to check that exporters with foreign currency accounts deposit export earnings in their bank account. Any discrepancies must be reported to the Central Bank.In the past, exporters and importers typically exchanged foreign currency directly by transferring money between bank accounts – often held with state lenders.The second change is that Nostro accounts – held in a foreign country and denominated in the currency of that country – can now be used for making import payments on behalf of clients. This reduces the demand for dollars within Myanmar.","/business/18834-kyat-appreciates-as-imports-slow-ahead-of-chinese-new-year.html"
"205",205,"Rubber farmers struggle as prices fall",2016-01-29,"Business","At Shwe Kokko Myaing’s rubber plantation in Myawady district, crowded trees stretch endlessly on either side of the road. The workers live in old dwellings by the roadside.           The five children are used to looking after each other. The oldest, aged eight, rocks his sister’s cradle while fixing lunch for the middle three.Their mother is out grinding rubber; their father is scraping latex.On another nearby farm, a worker said, “We start at midnight or 1am, scraping latex and collecting the latex cups, grinding the rubber and setting it out to dry. We come home at 3pm to eat and sleep.”Two families live on the farm. “We have no children,” he said. “The other family has two school-age kids, but they can’t afford to send them to school, and the village is far away. The farm owner provides housing and food, but it’s not enough. Anything else we need, we have to buy ourselves.”A decline in Chinese demand and the low quality of much of Myanmar’s rubber are combining to drag down income levels at the country’s plantations, depressing much-needed investment and deterring skilful workers who can earn more elsewhere.Rubber prices are down, says U Kyin Thein, the farm’s owner, affecting Thailand as well as Myanmar. “In the past, we got a good price when the dollar was high. It’s high now, but prices have not recovered.” The big problem is the slowdown in Chinese demand.“Low prices are bad for farm owners and workers alike,” U Kyin Thein said. “Workers are paid by the pound, and the price of a pound of rubber is just over K500. Of that, the owner takes 60 percent and the worker 40pc. An acre, with 700 trees, will yield only 10 pounds of latex a day.”Prices started falling last year, from a 2011 high of K900 a pound, said U Nyan Sein, a trader at the Sein Myitthar rubber trading centre in Myawady city, on the border with Thailand’s Mae Sot.Benchmark Tokyo rubber fetched 158.9 yen (US$1.34) a kilogram yesterday, falling around 70pc from a high of 526.4 yen in February 2011.Most of Myanmar’s rubber plantations use Thai species, so the quality is the same on both sides of the border, he said, adding, “Production and quality are less here because fertiliser is not used properly and growing techniques are inferior. Myanmar rubber is no better than third class, sometimes fifth class, except for at Thanbyuzayat in Mon State, which invested in machinery and produces rubber for use in Japan.”Everyone else, he says, is bound to the Chinese market.Rubber trader U Nyan Htun says the equipment in use in most Myanmar farms – latex cups, collecting bins, grinding machines – is dirty.“This affects the quality of the product. That’s why our rubber is poorer than Thai rubber even though we have the same type of trees.”Low prices are hindering plantation owners from hiring the best latex scrapers, said U Nyan Sein. In Kayah State, farm workers are employed to scrape latex, he said.“The best workers are not paid by the pound, but by the tree, at the rate of K7-8 per tree,” he said.Scraping is suspended from mid-January and February when the rubber tree leaves fall, resuming in March and recessing again in June.Farmer U Kyin Thein says the low prices are also driving down investment. The capital required exceeds K10 million per acre, plus the cost of hiring guards, mowing and fertilisers. He said some growers in Thailand were already switching to corn and palm oil. Some investors plant coffee alongside the rubber to cover costs.Daw Aye Nwe, 60, a rubber farm worker from Balu Kyun, Mon State, who now works at Shwe Kokko Myaing, said, “I’ve been here three years. I work as a guard, and I also scrape latex. Even if all our family members work, we earn only K1.5 million a year. Wages are so low we spend that much going back to our village during the rainy season.”Earlier this year, U Khaing Myint, secretary general of the Myanmar Rubber Planters and Producers Association, said rubber plantation owners across Myanmar are shuttering their businesses. If they paid workers to scrape the latex, they would make a loss, yet they cannot afford to trade in the rubber business for another industry, he said.“Changing the crop is not a good solution,” he told The Myanmar Times. Planting is not cheap – it costs between K2.5 and K3 million to plant rubber on 1 acre.“Rubber planters should persevere. The low prices won’t last forever,” he said.Translation by Emoon","/business/18743-rubber-farmers-struggle-as-prices-fall.html"
"206",206,"Dry port discussions under way on China border",2016-01-27,"Business","Two miles north of Muse, on Myanmar’s border with China, a company is negotiating with farmers to buy their land with a view to building a dry port.           The Shan State government has approved the project, and has asked First Golden Dragon Company to secure consent from landowners, said Muse district administrator U Kyaw Kyaw Htun.The company hopes to build a 210-acre dry port including a highway bus station, space for trucks to load and unload, cold storage and new warehouses, he said.All large trucks passing between Myanmar and China would be able to use the new development for storage, reducing heavy traffic and facilitating smoother trade, he said.“Trucks currently have to park along the side of the road while they wait to enter the customs area at 105 Mile,” he said. As a result, the two-lane road grows quickly congested. Muse is the main overland trading point between Myanmar and China, bordering Ruili in Yunnan province.“Myanmar exports are checked at 105 Mile, and sometimes do not pass through to China for some time. But there is no parking space. It’s essential that fields are set aside for vehicles and that warehouses are built to house Myanmar and China products,” U Kyaw Kyaw Htun said.The only problem, he said, is that the land is owned by farmers.“We have been seven or eight times to negotiate, as we want to make sure they understand. The zone would need to be very big, and would have to cross the 105 Mile trading zone.” Of the 201 acres, 147 would be used for the dry port, and the remaining land for warehouses, offices, restaurants, hotels and shops.If the company is able to negotiate sale of the land, the project will pass to the Myanmar Investment Commission for approval.The area includes Shan traditional houses, a museum and a restaurant, which would all have to make way for the dry port, U Kyaw Kyaw Htun said.“We are offering much higher compensation than is offered elsewhere in Myanmar, but farmers want more. Ultimately it depends on their agreement,” he said.U Sai Hla Min of First Golden Dragon Company said he had originally offered to pay K30 million per acre, but his offer had been refused. He is now offering K80 million for an acre – which some landowners have accepted, though others are still holding out. He hopes the negotiations will be complete by the end of this year.If it goes ahead, the project would tie in with a government plan to build a network of eight inland ports across the country, under a United Nations initiative.Thura U Aung Myo Myint, general manager of Myanma Railways, previously told The Myanmar Times the government has plans to develop inland ports in eight locations by 2020 – Yangon, Mandalay, Muse, Tamu, Mawlamyine, Monywa, Bago and Pyay.Dry ports can help combine the use of road, rail, sea and waterways when moving cargo across and between countries.U Win Lwin from the Ministry of Commerce, who runs the trading zone at 105 Mile, said around 1300 trucks pass through the area each day, and that a dry port could reduce traffic congestion and make the customs process more efficient. For now, the small area is jammed with laden trucks.“When the traffic is very heavy, far fewer trucks are able to pass across the border, or if the traffic is clear, many will arrive at once, both from lower Myanmar and from Muse. Larger facilities would keep the traffic stable, resulting in better business,” U Win Lwin said.U Soe Tun, deputy chair of the Myanmar Rice Federation, said for the rice trade it is very important that trucks are given more space and that new special economic zones are developed on the Myanmar side of the border.“The problem now is that Chinese traders don’t want to come, so goods from Myanmar have to be taken to China. If the project is successful, it would bring huge benefits,” he said. “The 105 Mile point was built for only a few hundred cars, but more than 1000 trucks pass through each day, so the traffic builds up and time is wasted.”Translation by Khine Thazin Han","/business/18677-dry-port-discussions-under-way-on-china-border.html"

Zhuoyuan Iskandar, a Chinese-Malaysian joint venture, is the latest in a line of foreign developers to use Yangon agents to market housing projects. Singaporean, Chinese, Thai and US properties have all been marketed in Myanmar.Agent KAE Alliance Company is selling units in the company’s flagship project Paradiso Nuova Condominium, Ko Kyaw Min Zin, chief executive officer of KAE’s local subsidiary.“We saw many good reasons for Myanmar customers to buy luxury apartments in Malaysia,” he said. “Housing there is cheaper than luxury housing here, and investors can make good profits from investing overseas.The condominium is located in Iskandar, Malaysia, on a purpose-built site on the border with Singapore. Developer Zhuoyuan Iskandar is a joint-venture between China’s Zhuoda Group and Malaysian firm Medini Iskandar.The condominium is due to be completed at the end of this year. It will comprise two tower blocks of 25 storeys each on 2.22 acres of land. Its 382 apartments range in size from 713 square feet to 6080 sq ft, with launch prices starting from 850 ringgit (US$192) per sq ft – lower than the average price for a luxury condominium unit in Yangon.“This is the first time a Malaysian condominium has been on sale in Myanmar,” said Ko Kyaw Min Zin. “Foreigners cannot buy property in Malaysia if it costs less than 1 million ringgit, but there is no limit in the Medini development.”Medini was built to generate investment and is the largest urban development project in Malaysia. It includes foreign hospitals, business parks, a Pinewood Studios and a Legoland theme park.Foreigners buying apartments in the development are exempt from paying a 30 percent sales tax to the Malaysian government.More than 80pc of units had been sold before the project went on sale to Myanmar, according to Ko Kyaw Min Zin. “Singaporean customers bought 76pc of the apartments sold and customers from Japan, Korea, China and Indonesia bought the other 26pc,” he said. “We have sold two apartments in Myanmar so far.”He hopes to sell another 18 apartments at the launch event on January 23 at Hotel Esperado in Yangon, he said.","/business/property-news/18470-malaysian-condo-sales-launched-in-myanmar.html"
"208",208,"China frets over relations with Myanmar",2016-01-08,"National News","China is clearly anxious over the trajectory of relations with Myanmar, concerned that a West-ward shift in policy under President U Thein Sein will go even further in that direction under the new government to be led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.          Those worries were seemingly on display late last month when a large Myanmar delegation – including National League for Democracy members, researchers and journalists – were given a 12-day tour of three Chinese cities sponsored by the ruling Communist Party.Rao Huihua, deputy director general of the party central committee’s International Department, cautioned that Myanmar’s development of relations with the West should not have a negative impact on its ties with China, its largest trading partner and a major investor.“Relations between Myanmar and China have been built systematically. Such good relations did not harm any country, and also relations between Myanmar and Western countries should not harm China,” she told her Myanmar guests.Visits to China over the past 20 years by senior members of Myanmar’s previous junta and U Thein Sein’s military-backed government were commonplace. But last year China capped its efforts to build a relationship with the NLD leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi by arranging her first-ever visit to the country last June, at the invitation of the Communist Party.Once-close ties between the two neighbours, enhanced by the West’s imposition of sanctions on Myanmar, have cooled considerably since President U Thein Sein took office in 2012 and, in one of his first acts, suspended the controversial Myitsone dam project in Kachin State that was to supply power to China.China’s privileged position in Myanmar has steadily eroded as the West has eased its sanctions. Relations between the two militaries, where China remains a major supplier of arms and equipment, have been sorely tested by the Kokang conflict in northern Shan State and the Tatmadaw’s offensives against ethnic Chinese insurgents close to the shared border.Nonetheless, China has sought to adjust to this new reality.“China always wants a smooth diplomatic relationship between Myanmar and the United States. That’s why we have always asked the US to lift economic sanctions against Myanmar,” Ms Rao said.“If Myanmar is prosperous, it is good for China. No matter what changes happen in the region, we are neighbours forever. So we should not deal with a win-lose pattern. It should be a win-win situation for both sides.”Relations between Myanmar and China did not just depend on diplomatic ties but also on economic sectors, she said. Regarding Chinese investment projects in Myanmar – which like the Myitsone dam have sparked considerable public opposition – Ms Rao said China accepted it should be more transparent in implementing such projects.However, she also suggested that the situation would improve if Myanmar developed its rules and regulations for doing businesses and – in a nod to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s election campaign – enforced the rule of law.“No one can work in any country lacking specific foreign policy for economic cooperation. Foreign policy [of every country] should meet with international standards and laws. China will work together and support Myanmar’s reform process in accordance with the laws,” she said.“We understand that the issue of rule of law will be challenging to handle for the new [NLD] government,” said Ms Rao. “All will wait and see with interest the reform process. China is keen to support Myanmar’s reforms.”Well aware of China’s concerns, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi sought to set the record straight in an interview she gave to the official news agency Xinhua shortly after her party’s November 8 election landslide. She pledged to pay “special attention” to ties with Beijing while saying that Myanmar would take a balanced approach in its foreign relations. She also stressed the need for transparency in economic projects.The Myanmar delegation, staying in top-class hotels, visited Beijing, the port of Xiamen and the southern city of Nanning. The delegation was treated to discussions with Communist Party officials, academics and political experts, and a field trip to learn about poverty alleviation projects. Professors sought to convince the visitors of the benefits to Myanmar of China’s “One Belt One Road” infrastructure projects linking eastern and southern China to markets in the West.The Myanmar delegation took the opportunity to explain the background to public protests against Chinese investment projects, such as the Myitsone dam and the Letpadaung copper mine, saying there was an acute lack of transparency and little benefit for local people.Chinese officials remained silent about the Myitsone dam, which analysts in Myanmar suspect will not see the light of day under the new government. However, Cui Chunlai, a Chinese NGO coordinator, explained that despite their initial opposition to hydroelectric power, the Chinese people “now understand that getting electricity from building dams is better than using the coal industry”.Suggesting that China had not given up on the vast project in Kachin State, he said Myanmar journalists would be invited next to visit China to understand the benefits of hydropower.","/national-news/18379-china-frets-over-relations-with-myanmar.html"

That forum objected to a lack of transparency in the tender selection process, demanded more consideration for the welfare of local people and asked that the project be suspended until the National League for Democracy takes power.The selection of a consortium led by a Chinese firm has done nothing to soothe local concerns. Some Rakhine locals have pointed to CITIC’s nationality as yet another concern. Several Chinese firms or projects involving Chinese companies have under fire from local protestors.Activists in Kachin oppose a US$2 billion hydroelectric project jointly run by Myanmar Economic Holdings and Chinese state-owned CPI Yunnan International Power Investment Company. Earlier this year local activists failed again in a bid to get a Chinese mining company to answer questions about its involvement in mining activities in Sagaing Region.But Rakhine people told The Myanmar Times that a larger concern was that the CITI-led-consortium will have a 70-year lease on the land, which can be extended.“Some locals are dissatisfied with the tender selection [of CITIC], although I have no comment on that,” said U Tun Kyi. “But I want to raise questions about plans for the long-term interests of locals. We’ll wait and see how the committee responds, and if it doesn’t have a plan we’ll demand one.”The first CITIC consortium won a tender to develop a deep sea port, and the second to develop an industrial zone. U Than Maung, who works in legal affairs for the BEAC, said that the CITIC consortia will own no more than 51 percent of shares in the industrial zone project, and not more than 85pc of the deep sea port projects.“We need six months to assess the land and calculate the cost,” he told The Myanmar Times. “Then, we will negotiate with local public companies for their share of the investment. Meanwhile, we’ll start the construction process.”Investments from local companies will begin after March, he added. The National League for Democracy is due to take power late that month.– Translation by Thiri Min Htun","/business/18388-rakhine-locals-to-dispute-sez-tender.html"
"210",210,"Can the NLD and China usher  in a new era in relations?",2015-12-16,"Opinion","China expects a new page to emerge in Myanmar’s domestic politics and foreign policy following the landslide election victory of the National League for Democracy. At the same time the party’s yet-to-be-clarified strategy has fuelled considerable uncertainty in the Chinese policy community, giving rise to heated discussion about whether – and if so, how – China should once again adjust its policy toward Myanmar.           China’s relationship with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was largely suppressed under the military government – a decision of expediency and necessity given the political reality between 1990 and 2011. After the NLD victory in the 1990 election, the then-Chinese ambassador was among the first to send her a letter of congratulations, an initiative that did not go down well with the junta. Bilateral ties were affected, leading China to recall its ambassador from Yangon from mid-1990 until July 1991. Contacts with the NLD were minimised and, as a result, Chinese diplomats, officials, scholars and businesses had almost no relationship with the democratic opposition.But with the political reforms adopted by President U Thein Sein’s government since 2011, the re-emergence of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi made the absence of relations with the NLD no longer a sensible or practical strategy. China took pains to build ties almost from scratch. Since 2011, three consecutive Chinese ambassadors have met regularly with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and there has been a flow of Chinese visitors to NLD headquarters in Yangon. Chinese authorities invited several NLD delegations to China to build relations, display the achievements of the Chinese government and express a desire to maintain a friendly relationship with Myanmar.Nonetheless, China remains uncertain about the NLD leader’s intentions. There is concern that she might harbour some resentment against China for its steadfast support of the military government that held her under house arrest for 15 years. Her democratic credentials, her status as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and her presumed close relationship with Western countries, especially the United States, all lead to a sense of foreboding in China about her future positions.The NLD leader seems to have demonstrated that she understands these Chinese concerns. So far, she has said and done the right things. She has been graceful and respectful in her meetings with Chinese dignitaries. In bilateral and other public occasions, she has openly committed herself and the NLD to a friendly policy toward China. The investigation committee for the Letpadaung copper mine project, which she chaired, approved the continuation of the joint venture despite opposition from local residents and Myanmar society in general. On issues that China prioritises, such as ethnic conflict on the border and China’s commercial projects across Myanmar, her position (or rather lack of it) has made her, at the minimum, an acceptable Myanmar politician for China.All these factors combined to culminate in a normalisation of relations between Beijing and the NLD leader during her visit to China in June 2015. The two sides seem to have demonstrated that they can move beyond ideological differences and narrow personal preferences to work well together as partners in pursuit of common interests. This reflects a maturing of China’s policy toward Myanmar and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s pragmatism as a politician.But she inherits a difficult legacy. Despite the official portrayal by both sides that the bilateral relationship is healthy, positive and expanding, the reality is that Sino-Myanmar relations have been on an abnormal, problematic trajectory since President U Thein Sein’s suspension of the China-backed Myitsone dam in September 2011. China bears deep grievances about its troubled economic projects in the country, feels unfairly penalised for its relationship with the military government by a pseudo-democratic government, and sees itself as victimised by Myanmar’s political transition. Furthermore, it has been frustrated by the government’s reluctance to cooperate with China’s strategic initiatives and profoundly disturbed by the Myanmar military’s audacity in attacking Chinese territory during its conflicts with ethnic minorities on the border.The rapidly growing presence and influence in Myanmar of the US and its allies, such as Japan, have further undermined China’s confidence and enhanced its sense of vulnerability.These perceived problems and challenges have had an impact. Annual approved foreign direct investment from China has dropped from US$8.2 billion in the peak year of 2010-11 to merely $56 million in 2013-14. Although the amount recovered to $516 million last year, it remains puny in comparison with the past. China is still Myanmar’s largest trading partner, although the largest factor has been a 446pc hike of exports to China due to a single project – the Sino-Myanmar gas pipeline, which started pumping in mid-2013.Under the political pressure of this uncertainty, China has felt compelled to strengthen its strategic leverage vis-à-vis Myanmar on different issues, leading to some Myanmar officials’ accusation in October that China had been meddling in the peace process and prevented certain groups from signing the nationwide ceasefire agreement.President U Thein Sein’s government has always had a public-opinion problem, stemming from past military dependence on China and crony relations with Chinese companies, leading it to feel compelled to cater to anti-China sentiment to gain popularity. In comparison, the NLD will operate from a position of strength domestically and will start from a clean slate in relations with China. It will be in a better position to make policy decisions based on the objective merits of specific projects or issues, allowing it to treat China rationally and pursue cooperation possibilities on a practical basis without emotional or historical baggage.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s initial statements on China have indicated she will go in this direction. In an interview with the Chinese Xinhua news agency after the elections, she promised a friendly policy toward China, but emphasised that China’s investments should be designed to gain the trust of the Myanmar people. She praised China’s One Belt One Road initiative. These messages have been welcomed in China.China still enjoys overwhelming influence in Myanmar. Its presence and influence can be felt in almost all walks of life. The change of government does not alter China’s strategic pursuits. It still wishes to press development of its infrastructure and connectivity projects through Myanmar to the Bay of Bengal. It still needs a tranquil and stable border. And it still competes with the US for influence.In this context, China will initiate its relations with an NLD government by demonstrating cooperative intentions with friendly gestures. It is likely to offer the new government financial capital, aid projects and even assistance in the peace process to help it achieve its priority goals. However, in six to 12 months, China will also demand responses on certain critical issues. This would include a final resolution to the suspended Myitsone dam project, a clear decision on development of the Kyaukphyu special economic zone, and agreements on the series of One Belt One Road projects, such as Sino-Myanmar highways and the Ayeyarwady River land-water joint transportation program.China will closely observe the development of peace negotiations with the ethnic groups, especially with those in northern Myanmar along the Chinese border. China understands well that a peaceful and unified Myanmar would serve China’s broader interests, since the conflicts are the most immediate obstacle blocking its economic and strategic programs. If Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is capable of shaping the consent of the ethnic minorities and bringing peace, China is unlikely to sabotage the process.China’s olive branch comes with certain conditions, however. Although specific terms might be negotiable, China will demand Myanmar’s genuine cooperation on the economic projects listed above. China will also want the NLD government to “respect” China’s national interests when working with Western countries, especially the US. Beijing is likely to react strongly to anything short of a clear middle-way approach. Indeed, uncertainty and suspicion surrounding Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s democratic convictions and her relationship with the West could escalate China’s reaction in such a scenario, making it harsher than it has been with President U Thein Sein’s government. The future NLD government should be particularly mindful of this perception.Neither should the NLD leader expect that China will abandon its relationship with other political forces in Myanmar, including the Union Solidarity and Development Party, the military and the cronies. The lesson of picking either or any side in Myanmar has proven costly and Beijing is unlikely to repeat the same mistake.China and Myanmar stand at a historic moment with a genuine opportunity to make their relationship truly normal. It will require supreme political wisdom, courage and leadership from both governments. Neither will get everything they want, but both will benefit from dialogue and cooperation. China should understand that an NLD government will be more responsive to the people’s will and accept the new political reality in Myanmar. And the NLD government should seek maximum strength from popular support for its policies, since that is the last thing China can defeat with coercion and economic enticement.– This is an edited version of an article that originally appeared on Asia Times.Yun Sun is a senior associate at the Henry L Stimson Center and a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution.","/opinion/18167-can-the-nld-and-china-usher-in-a-new-era-in-relations.html"
"211",211,"Tough decisions for NLD as Myitsone suspension deadline looms",2015-12-14,"Editor's Pick","For the opposition, the stakes couldn’t be higher. On the one hand there are the livelihoods and expectations of thousands, while on the other a multi-billion-dollar contract and relations with the world’s next superpower.           For both sides the pendulum hinges on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and whether she will sacrifice a site of great environmental and cultural significance, or choose instead to risk alienating China.Either way, she doesn’t have much time. When her National League for Democracy takes up the lead of the government next year, the temporary suspension of the Myitsone dam – located near the confluence of the Maikha and Malikha rivers just north of Myitkyina – will be up for renegotiation.Political analyst Yun Sun from the US-based Stimson Center gives the party a six-to-12-month window before China will demand a yes-or-no response.Working in China’s favour is the opposition leader’s lack of a decisive line on the issue. During her election campaign in Kachin State, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi hedged on questions about the project, which President U Thein Sein suspended for the length of his term in office in September 2011. “It would be irresponsible to make promises without knowing the details of the contract,” she said, adding that she would “do what [she] can”.Axing the project would surely earn the Nobel laureate a groundswell of popular support, while a refusal to do so could elicit cries of hypocrisy given that she personally penned appeals to protect the vital artery. But as Graeme Smith, a research fellow at the Australian National University, has noted, “the letters were penned a while ago”.In Kachin State, many believe the termination of the behemoth project is already a foregone conclusion.At Aung Min Tha, one of the relocation sites hosting more than 2000 families uprooted for the project, residents anxiously await the transition. They are convinced that the NLD will deliver a final blow to the hydropower deal and allow them to return to their former homes.The families were evicted from their riverfront properties five years ago. China Power Investment (CPI), the builder of the US$3.6 billion hydropower dam project, trucked them beyond the anticipated flood line into a newly erected model village with rows of identical stilt houses complete with white crosses tacked on front. By the developer’s estimates, around 11,800 families would need to be relocated to make way for the dam’s reservoir, which will see 766 square kilometres (almost 190,000 acres) inundated.While the Chinese state-backed builder has gone to pains to paint the trade-off as preferential – the new houses have running water and electricity, schools were built, scholarships provided, a clinic set up – Aung Min Tha retains the impression of a ghost town, where residents act as if they are serving time in prison.Beyond the cookie-cutter facades, the town is little more than a simulacrum. There are no markets, no shops, no jobs and no commerce.“It looks nice from the outside, but they didn’t build these houses well,” said Ma Luu Ja, a 30-year-old mother of four. “In rainy season there are leaks, and the windows are broken. I don’t feel like it’s a very safe house.”The 3-inch gap between her empty window frames and the wall create a draught. Her ceiling has holes, the concrete foundation is cracked, and the doors refuse to close properly. But far worse than the decrepit houses, is that she and her neighbours, formerly subsistence farmers, have no way to earn an income.“Where we lived before we could grow our own food. We had mangoes, oranges, tea and vegetables, like carrots and tomatoes,” said Ma Luu Ja. Forced from her 2-acre plot in the middle of the anticipated flood zone, she was given a small, infertile square in exchange. Her neighbour said the soil is “too thin and rocky” for farming, with five years of failed crop experiments to prove it. The hill abutting the village has even earned a nickname, “Grow-Nothing Mountain”.“Our previous life was better, easier,” said Ko Brang Mai, 35. “Here we have electricity and running water and our children can go to school, but we have no way to get money to support our families. We can’t keep living here.”He said he was travelling at the time his family was forcibly relocated. When he returned he was given just $40 in exchange for the plot of land that had formerly sustained them.Many of the villagers have taken up odd jobs in nearby goldmines. But some have refused to give up their hillside cultivation, even though it’s now 9 kilometres (5.6 miles) down a windy, landslide-prone road bearing “restricted access” signs.“What choice do we have for our families to eat?” said Daw Luu, 50. “Here we can grow just two or three plants. That’s hardly enough.”Representatives from CPI did not return repeated requests for comment, but a press officer from CPI’s parent company told The Myanmar Times in June that the developers had not gotten a fair chance to pitch the benefits of the project before it was shot down. They said the terms of the original contract, agreed with the former military government, prohibited them from explaining the benefits to locals.The relocated villagers said they have heard enough promises from the company, however.“The developers told us after the dam was constructed that our lives would be better, that this would become a city and we would have 24-hour electricity and many people would come here,” Daw Luu said. “But no one believes them. How could we when they have left us without even enough food?”Not a single one of the Aung Min Tha villagers said they would stay if the dam is cancelled. And after the election, the expectation shifted, and cancellation became not an “if” but a “when”.“If this is a democracy then the government must listen first to the needs of the people,” said U Sam Ra Zau Naw, 74. “Perhaps the government could get benefits from this project, but certainly the Kachin people would not.”Under the terms of the original contract, about 90 percent of the power generated from the hydropower dam was to be pumped back to China.Some of the relocated families have not bothered waiting for the government transition, but have slowly, quietly returned to houses grown wild with five years of neglect. Their return was pre-empted by many signs of an impending cancellation. For years, the Chinese dam workers’ houses were abandoned, leaving behind an empty, rusting compound. Restricted access signs have disappeared within the last month or so, and rations formerly provided by developers CPI and Asia World have all but dried up.At a roadside teashop in Tang Hpre, one of the evicted villages, the owner said authorities have stopped making even half-hearted attempts to warn the residents away.CPI appears to have fought, and lost, a last-ditch push for the dam in May. Local administrators were dispatched to get evicted villagers to sign contracts relinquishing any control over the vacated properties. The developer had even hired British public relations firm Bell Pottinger to help promote the 458-foot-tall (140-metres), 6000-megawatt dam as purveyor of more good than harm. But the PR contract lapsed in July – Bell Pottinger did not return requests for comment about whether the arrangement was renewed in any capacity – and the villagers refused to ink any contracts.According to the Kachin Baptist Convention daycare director in Tang Hpre, 50 to 60 families have already started re-inhabiting their homes, with most going back and forth between Aung Myin Tha and the old properties. Signs of inhabitance are clear, but subtle: Weeds have been ripped out to make way for vegetable patches, dogs and well-fed pigs linger in fenced-off yards, and laundry lines are tucked just out of sight.Daw Laikh Aung Khun, 40, said she never stopped returning to her family home, the last house along a grassy lane behind the church where she, her children, and her grandson were all born. She says she comes very often, but never stays “too long” and the police do not bother her.“Nobody can really live in Aung Myin Tha,” she said. “People will always come back home.”According to political analysts, the NLD doesn’t have to wreck its ties with China to backpedal on the Myitsone dam. Sino-Myanmar relations, though strained, have already moved past the “Myitsone event”, as it was dubbed by Lu Guangsheng, a Chinese academic and professor at Yunnan University. President U Thein Sein’s decision to postpone the project may have been perceived as a “slap” to Beijing, but China has too many other interests at stake to castigate its resource-rich neighbour in retaliation for one axed project.“For Myanmar citizens, Myitsone is many things: national identity, environment, autonomy, peace, and livelihood. It is uncompromisable,” said U Soe Myint Aung, a political analyst and founder of the Tagaung Institute of Political Science.“While the cancellation may result in short-term repercussions on the bilateral relations, Myanmar and China will have many other issues to cooperate and ways to patch up relations,” he said.Getting out of the contract for the Myitsone, one of seven planned cascade dams with a combined 20,000-megawatt capacity, would be an expensive endeavour. Under a bilateral agreement from 2002, Myanmar would have to reimburse the state-owned electricity giant for any investments already disbursed.“Unless there is a significant political agreement on the top level, meaning the Chinese government [okays] it, Myanmar cannot potentially get out of the deal without financial consequences,” said Ms Yun from the Stimson Center. “However, the Chinese government will not offer such good will for free and there will be other strategic demands.”But perhaps further evidencing groundwork laid to finally end the dam, CPI has already conducted an evaluation of its expenses for the project, which were totalled in October at around $800 million. How the NLD could refund the expenditure and placate its energy-hungry neighbour remains unclear. A party spokesperson would not even confirm if Daw Aung San Suu Kyi discussed a cancellation strategy during her visit to China in June when she met with President Xi Jinping, or in subsequent meetings with the ambassador to Myanmar.In the valley along the Myitsone, the choice to build or to cancel the dam is perceived narrowly – the government can protect the people and the main waterway, or exploit them.“Every political party that came here promised they would support the people and do good,” said Daw Luu. “The people have chosen the government and now must wait and see if the promises are true.”","/home-page/editor-s-pick/18126-tough-decisions-for-nld-as-myitsone-suspension-deadline-looms-2.html"

"213",213,"Experts call for dam review to consider earthquake risks",2015-12-14,"National News","If there is one place most ill-equipped for a mega hydropower dam holding back cascades of water, it might very well be along a fault line. Yet China’s Myitsone project is slated for such a quake-prone site not far from the Sagaing Fault.          In addition to concerns of environmental degradation and displacement, opponents of the Myitsone dam have noted that if the water storage bank were to rupture in an earthquake, the flooding would stretch so far as to inundate the Kachin State capital, Myitkyina, 27 miles away (43.4 kilometres).U Chit Ko Ko, a geological engineer from Australia’s New South Wales University, said the earthquake risk alone should prompt a revaluation of the temporarily suspended project. The National League for Democracy government next year will be tasked with choosing to axe or continue the project, which is funded by a Chinese state-backed energy giant.“We need to observe the potential risks and benefits of the project via a team of experts,” he said, adding that such a survey could not be rushed.Envisioned as a Myanmar-based twin to the Three Gorges project, the US$3.6 billion Myitsone would be the 15th-largest dam in the world. Despite its massive size, few environmental studies were conducted before the contract for the 6000 megawatt project was signed.The dam builder, China Power Investment Corporation, said it would study downstream impacts during the construction phase, meaning that averting environmental impacts would be nearly impossible. A survey conducted by US-based environmental research group International Rivers and local NGOs found the developer’s environmental impact assessment “seriously flawed” and “deficient”.Due to an outpouring of popular dissent, President U Thein Sein put a pause on the project – the largest Chinese investment in Myanmar then to date – in 2011.According to U Chit Ko Ko, since the dam is slated to be especially large – 4300 feet (1310 metres) long by 458 feet tall – any future consideration of reinstituting the project will need to take into account the earthquake risk.“I think it’s probable that the next government will not resume it. But they will have to decide by studying the plans, and consulting with experts, which will all take time,” he said.U Aye Lwin, a member of the Myanmar Geological Association, said the NLD will also have to consider what kind of precedent it set when it decides on the dam’s future.He added that the Ayeyarwady River has already been muddied and filled with silt due to bridges built without regard for the environment, and that though the country is rich in rivers and creeks, it is also subject to the whims of floods and droughts that could be exacerbated by developments.“As it a people-elected government, we hope it will make decisions after consulting with the people,” he said.Translation by Thiri Min Htun","/national-news/18112-experts-call-for-dam-review-to-consider-earthquake-risks.html"
"214",214,"Myanmar faces high barriers to joining AEC: economists",2015-12-10,"Business","The challenges Myanmar faces as it prepares to join the Asean Economic Community are formidable, said economists, as regional countries prepare to form a unified economic group on December 31.          The AEC vision is a globally integrated single market and production base in a highly competitive economic region, with equitable development. In theory, the economic bloc will lead to unlimited investment and trade opportunities between members.In practice, the barriers are high. Along with Cambodia and Laos, Myanmar has been granted an extension and will not join the AEC until 2018, but economists say even this target may be hard to meet.“It is true that we are struggling to prepare for the AEC,” economic adviser to the president U Zaw Oo told The Myanmar Times.“So we are stepping very carefully. We of course need to develop our economic infrastructure, but we must build it without leapfrogging.”In infrastructure development, a key driver of economic growth, Myanmar lags well behind other countries in the region, including Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.Poor infrastructure is a major barrier to competitiveness. Myanmar is rated 145 out of 160 countries in the World Bank’s 2014 Logistics Performance Index – the lowest score in Asia. This will put it at a disadvantage once it joins the regional community.A lack of skilled labour, combined with outdated economic policies, investment laws and weak law enforcement will set Myanmar back even further, economists said.They pointed out that the country still needs to tackle essential issues such as food security, competition laws, intellectual property rights and gearing up its agriculture sector, to allow a smooth entry to the AEC.Le Luong Minh, ASEAN secretary general, said while the AEC is 80 percent complete, it would only be fully complete once customs tariffs were eliminated entirely. A number of countries in the region including Myanmar have yet to relax trading regulations and taxes, including customs tariffs.For this reason, the least developed countries in the bloc have been given a chance to catch up, he said.Yet U Tin Cho, senior adviser to Parami Energy Group of Companies, believes this extension is in some ways a disadvantage. “At first, Myanmar will be unable to take advantage of the benefits, while other members will profit,” he said.From early next year, said U Tin Cho, the member countries that have abolished taxes will form strong trade relations, leaving Myanmar and other Least Developed Countries one step behind.Meanwhile, Myanmar is taking a number of steps to ensure its readiness.Japan has been helping with infrastructure upgrades since 2012, and the commerce ministry is preparing to adopt a national single window system. Scheduled to launch in 2016, this will allow traders to secure all the permits they need in one place, and is a precursor to cutting tariffs completely.By the end of this year, customs duties will be cut by more than 90pc, said U San Lwin, deputy director general of the ASEAN single window department at the customs ministry. Once the new system is in place, he said, it will create more opportunities for economic development, as well as facilitating free regional trade.Beside infrastructure development, Myanmar must also take steps to improve the transparency and accuracy of its statistics, said Hank Lim, senior research fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. In the past, the country has not invested in accurate data, figures and information on bilateral or regional trade, he said, due to weak rule of law and customs red tape.Many of Myanmar’s industries are poorly regulated and official figures on exports of natural resources such as jade, rubies and teak, differ from the import figures of neighbouring countries. In the jade sector specifically, official figures put exports in fiscal year 2014 at barely US$1 billion, whileChinese import data indicates gemstone imports from Myanmar were worth $12.3 billion last year. Advocacy group Global Witness puts the value of the industry last year at $31 billion.When Myanmar took the ASEAN chair for the first time in 2014, it signed a number of pro-trade bilateral agreements, and connected with regional members to discuss the practical implementation of the AEC.Since then, the government has geared up its support for small and medium sized enterprises and is taking steps toward poverty reduction, said U Moe Kyaw, managing director of Myanmar Marketing Research & Development Company.But Myanmar may not be unable to create the conditions needed to join the AEC on its own, he said.“It might not be successful, because it cannot afford to reduce poverty and narrow development gaps with other countries in the region, however hard it tries to prepare.”Poverty reduction is one of the greatest challenges Myanmar faces, with 26pc of its 51.4 million citizens living beneath the poverty line and more than half living just above it. Climate change and challenges in the food and energy sectors are likely to hold back poverty reduction efforts.After Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar in 2008, the government began to focus on food security and developing solutions for natural disasters, as well as accelerating poverty reduction efforts. When it took the ASEAN chair, Myanmar adopted the ASEAN Framework for Equitable Economic Development.Yet questions remain. Daw Tin Tin They, former director of the Foreign Economic Relations Department under the national planning ministry, said it was not yet clear how Myanmar would adapt its laws and services without losing out.Mr Ponciano, senior economist at the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia told The Myanmar Times that Myanmar needs more time before it is ready to join the AEC, and must first solve its own issues including poverty.The country has so far been unable to use its natural resources to lift the living standards of 25 million people, who remain in deep poverty, he said. “An agricultural revolution is one of the solutions to help Myanmar move forwards, but the government has not yet set this in motion.”U Kan Zaw, Union minister of national planning and economic development, told The Myanmar Times that Myanmar may be defeated by some challenges on the way to implementing the AEC, even as it succeeds in overcoming others.“We need to overcome the challenges and continue to move forward on the essential elements,” he said. “No country will implement the AEC perfectly. We must try to do our best.”","/business/18071-myanmar-faces-high-barriers-to-joining-aec-economists.html"
"215",215,"CB Bank launches new trade finance products ",2015-12-04,"Business","Local lender Co-operative Bank, better known as CB Bank, has ramped up its trade financing services and will now provide financing directly to exporters, becoming the first bank in the country to do so.          At the launch of the new products in Yangon yesterday, U Kyaw Lynn, the bank’s executive vice chair said exporters will now be able to take out loans, using their trade documents as collateral. This will make local exporters more competitive, allowing them more flexibility, as well as reducing their credit and exchange rate risks, he said.The bank’s newly formed trade unit team will handle international trade finance, based on four new products. The first is financing loans before shipment, to cover working capital costs. The second is invoice financing, which allows exporters to borrow money based on what they are owed.The third is export bills purchase under documents against payment, which means the bank can buy an exporter’s trade documents in return for the amount of money owed by the buyer, before the trade payment is made.The fourth service is letters of credit in the post-shipment period, which allow a bank to guarantee that the seller will receive a timely payment from the buyer – if they fail to pay, the bank steps in. Trade financing is still new in Myanmar – most exporters and importers pay for shipments on the spot. With a letter of credit agreement in place, exporters are able to ship products before receiving payment.CB Bank will be able to extend loans within five days of confirming an exporter’s documents are sound, said U Kyaw Lynn. Short-term financing will help customers to meet manufacturing or production expenses, he said.Banks in Myanmar can only issue loans against collateral. Typically this is property or occasionally gold, on which banks can lend up to 40 percent of the value. CB Bank also accepts original letters of credit, said U Kyaw Lynn.“We only provide loans to customers with a good credit rating, as this type of collateral is high risk. Our internal credit rating committee will carry out careful checks,” he said.Many banks in Myanmar lack a credit rating system or basic know-your-customer standards, one of the reasons the Central Bank of Myanmar imposes such strict lending rules.Myanma Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) and Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB) have provided basic export financing services for years, while commercial banks only started to move into trade finance in 2011 after being authorised for the first time to handle foreign exchange.However, until now banks have required customers to deposit 100pc of the value of the trade payment to be viable for a letter of credit.CB Bank’s treasury department will also offer forex services to its corporate customers, through account-to-account transfers, said deputy general manager U Kyaw Thu Ko. In addition to US dollar, Singapore dollar and euro currently offered by most domestic banks, CB Bank will trade the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, he said.CB Bank is leading the way in trade financing. In October it became the first local lender to sign with the Asian Development Bank under its Trade Finance Program. The ADB will provide up to US$12 million per year to support CB Bank’s trade finance operations. CB Bank already had several trade lines, but its standalone credit rating is low – around ‘B’ – which limits the business it can do.On the other hand, the ADB has an ‘AAA’ credit rating – the highest rating available. Once CB Bank’s trade finance lines are guaranteed by the ADB, it will be able to finance much larger trades.","/business/17977-cb-bank-launches-new-trade-finance-products.html"
"216",216,"Companies begin to feel the heat as import costs climb",2015-12-02,"Business","Myanmar's plummeting currency has prompted a vicious circle of rising prices in the import-dependent economy, in which even export-driven companies face rising costs, say businesspeople.           New laws and regulations are urgently needed to control the kyat, they said, which has fallen by more than 25 percent to the US dollar this year to K1300 yesterday, its weakest since Myanmar adopted a managed float in 2012.In the unofficial market, the rate has reached up to K1315. The currency seems a one-way bet amid growing government deficits and the near-term prospect of rising rates in the US.“Rising US dollar prices are directly affecting importers, but consumers are facing the most difficulties as the price of commodities is rising and will continue to rise,” said U Ye Min Aung, director of Myanmar Agriculture Public Corporation (MAPCO).“When US dollar prices rise, traders cannot import as much as before, so local prices increase even further,” he said. “The Ministry of Commerce, the Central Bank, Myanmar Investment Commission and the Ministry of Finance must meet and work out how to solve the problem.”A weaker kyat makes exports more competitive. In theory this should benefit farmers, but Myanmar imports farming machinery and fertiliser, he said.As these essentials become less affordable to farmers, production will fall, along with exports of rice, beans, pulses and other products, he said.“It’s a circle, it’s all linked, and it will make business for everybody very difficult,” said U Ye Min Aung. “In the agriculture sector, we are worried. The situation is weak. We need more international investment, but for that we need the government to cooperate.”Export volumes have already taken a hit following nationwide flooding earlier this year that destroyed large areas of farmland across the country.Businesspeople say they are feeling the heat. Very little is produced in Myanmar, which imports almost everything from construction materials, to petroleum, to cooking oil, to cars, to industrial materials, to medicines and any number of other basic goods, said petroleum importer U Myo Htwe.“The price of all materials and products except petroleum has risen. But the price of fuel is out of Myanmar’s control, and if it rises again the situation here will be bad,” he said.The price of international benchmark Brent crude oil had fallen from $57.33 a barrel at the start of the year to $44.82 yesterday, according to Bloomberg data.“Local businesspeople have stores of petroleum, but if these stores run out and prices rise, we will really face difficulties,” said U Myo Htwe. “We have a choice now – stop importing, or sell our goods at an expensive price. That’s why I say prices should be controlled.”In the garment sector too, materials are almost all imported. Chair of the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association U Myint Soe previously told The Myanmar Times the only materials produced domestically are cotton balls and high-density poly- ethylene bags, which are also made from imported materials.Myanmar does not even produce thread, he said, adding that such reliance on imports is dangerous for the cut, make and pack industry. Tailors too, are losing out because they have to import textiles, which are becoming increasingly expensive, said Ma Su Wai Yee, owner of CiCi clothing.Electronics shops in Yangon say the weak kyat has not yet caught up with them but that once they replenish stocks they will have to raise the price of products and mobile phone handsets.A salesperson at J Phone in Kyauktada township said prices are likely to rise as soon as this month. “After this, the market will become tougher because our products are not basic commodities, and people won’t want to buy expensive goods,” she said.In the past, businesspeople imported electronics and accessories directly from China, but as the kyat weakens against the Chinese renminbi, they are increasingly buying from local wholesale shops, said the owner of Handsome handsets and accessories in Tarmwe township.“We face difficulties because the price of accessories is rising. Now we can’t go to China anymore to trade directly because the kyat has weakened and the price of accommodation there is too high.”In late June, the Central Bank increased the volume of US dollars it sells to the market in its daily auctions, after pledging to supply enough dollars to local banks to support essential imports such as fuel and palm oil.Deputy governor U Set Aung told The Myanmar Times last week that the Central Bank is planning to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation and stabilise the exchange rate.A new reserve requirement ratio will be imposed on local banks by January and the Central Bank also plans to scale up the deposit auctions it holds every fortnight, he said, adding that the monetary authority may consider raising interest rates in the future.The Central Bank is also working with organisations including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency to work out how best to address the problem, according to reports last week in state media.Meanwhile, money changers in Yangon say they are running into problems as few people are willing to sell their dollars for kyat. Supply and demand are out of balance, said U Myo Htwe, who is also the director of Farmer Pho Yar Zar money changer.“Dollars are expensive so there are no sellers, but demand is high – we only have buyers. As a result, business is bad,” he said.","/business/17917-companies-begin-to-feel-the-heat-as-import-costs-climb.html"
"217",217,"Education is key to the top table",2015-11-24,"Sports","Investment in education is the key to seeing Myanmar catch up with the rest of the table tennis world, according to Myanmar Table Tennis Federation president Kyaw Kyaw in an interview with The Myanmar Times.           The sport administrator’s plans range from the introduction of the sport into the country’s public school sector to the delivery of international standard officiating courses in Myanmar.It is these measures that he hopes will lift Myanmar from the periphery of the ping-pong world to SEA Games success.“Myanmar’s table tennis lags far behind the rest of the world and table tennis is a game of intelligence so to improve we must start young with improved education,” said Kyaw Kyaw.On the elite participants, front Kyaw Kyaw said preparations for the 2017 SEA Games – and beyond – were well under way but recognised that success at that level will take time and well-targeted resources.“We currently have 12 national athletes in camp in Yangon training under a Chinese coach. We hope also to send the players to China for a joint training camp – without such a trip we cannot face Singapore’s Olympians and hope to medal at the SEA Games,” said Kyaw Kyaw.With that in mind Kyaw Kyaw also has plans to improve the presence of the sport in the education sector.“We plan to launch table tennis into schools by supporting Yangon’s Basic Education High Schools with equipment and sending our athletes and coaches into the schools to demonstrate the sport,” said Kyaw Kyaw.The president was speaking following a presentation ceremony to recognise Myanmar’s first in-country-trained international-standard referees.As part to improve the elite end of the nation’s game, the Myanmar Table Tennis Federation are investing in talent both in officials as well as players.That process includes bringing international standard officiating courses to Myanmar, the first of which has led to one graduate being offered a place table-side at the upcoming ASEAN Para Games.Thuzar Lwin will referee at the regional disability-sport contest running from December 3 to 9 in Singapore.“Normally international referee qualifications are held in established table-tennis-playing nations but I requested that the International Table Tennis Federation come to Myanmar,” told The Myanmar Times.The course started in April 2014 with 33 participants beginning the process but only three – including Thuzar Lwin – successful completing the course.But the president has further plans to upskill those working around the sport. “I hope our second holding of the course [in September 2016] will be even more successful than the first … We will provide our local referees with English-language skills,” added Kyaw Kyaw.And Thuzar Lwin hopes to be able to pass on the knowledge she will gather from her experience on the international scene.“This will be my first experience as an international referee but my second international competition after the 27th SEA Games [hosted in Myanmar] where I was a local referee.“When the MTTF hold the next international referee qualification course I’ll be there helping the junior referees,” said Thuzar Lwin.","/sports/17781-education-is-key-to-the-top-table.html"
"218",218,"NLD leader assures China of continued friendly ties",2015-11-19,"National News","Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has assured China that Myanmar’s next government will maintain friendly relations while paying “special attention” to ties with its neighbours, according to Xinhua news agency.          The National League for Democracy leader was also quoted as saying in an interview with China’s state-run agency after her election triumph that Myanmar welcomed foreign investment, including from China.But she stressed it was imperative that investors gain the trust of the people.Her remarks could be taken to refer to the controversial Myitsone dam project which President U Thein Sein suspended in 2012 under public pressure. That suspension ends with the president’s departure from office early next year and the Chinese entity running the project, CPI Yunnan International Power Investment Company, says it hopes to resume work.Chinese-backed companies make up the largest source of foreign investment in Myanmar but their heavy-handed approach, especially in exploitation of natural resources, has triggered a public backlash.“Ties between neighbours are always more delicate than that between countries far apart,” Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was quoted as saying. “We’ll pay special attention to our relations in order to make them smooth, effective and clear.”Xinhua quoted the NLD leader as saying Myanmar had always adopted a friendly foreign policy with all countries, including China, since independence in 1948 and that the NLD could successfully implement such a policy.She was also quoted as praising China’s “Belt and Road” initiative launched by President Xi Jinping to expand trade and infrastructure between Asia, Africa and Europe. She said she hoped the plan could benefit all sides.China’s pragmatic leadership took advantage of Western sanctions to develop closer ties with Myanmar’s former military regime, but started to pay attention to the rise of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi after her release from house arrest in 2010 and election to parliament in 2012.Protracted negotiations between Beijing and the NLD leader resulted in her first visit to China in June this year. In an unusual break with protocol for a visit by a party leader, Beijing agreed to her insistence that she meet Mr Xi. A source close to the process said Beijing requested that in turn the Nobel peace laureate make no public reference to human rights and the jailing of Chinese dissidents.China fears that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s close, life-long ties to India and Europe will lead to a westward shift in Myanmar’s strategic focus. Diplomats say that at the same time relations have worsened because of the Kokang border conflict and what Myanmar perceives as China’s backroom interference in the nationwide ceasefire process.“China has its concerns about the NLD being pro-West but most likely will watch how the NLD manages the relationship with China over issues such as the ethnic minorities and the Myitsone dam. The carrots and sticks are both readied to prepare for different scenarios,” said Yun Sun, analyst at the Washington-based Stimson Center.“China wants Myanmar to acquiesce to China’s strategic, political and economic demand for cooperation. To be more specific, it wants Myanmar to respect China’s interests and keep a distance with the US,” said Ms Sun, who was also an observer of the November 8 election for the Carter Center. However, the relationship between the Tatmadaw and Beijing is “more complicated than just love or hate”, she said.“They need each other: The Tatmadaw is isolated by the international community and Beijing is a stable source of aid, equipment and training. Beijing also sees the Tatmadaw as a resort of support since they share interests on joint projects,” she said.Those ties have been strained over their differences towards Myanmar’s ethnic minorities but they have too many convergent interests to end their relationship, Ms Sun said.","/national-news/17696-nld-leader-assures-china-of-continued-friendly-ties.html"

Villagers living in compounds eight miles from their former homes have been in limbo for almost five years, after they were forced to relocate to make way for the ambitious Myitsone hydropower dam, by Chinese developer CPI Yunnan International Power Investment Company (CPIYN).Shortly afterward in 2011 under pressure from civil society groups, President U Thein Sein suspended the project for the duration of his term in office.Yet 500 households from three villages in southern Kachin State – Tan Hpre, Myitsone and Padan Par – have not been allowed to return home.Villagers say they are optimistic the new government will grant them some certainty about the future.They say they have struggled to settle – each household has been given an 80-by-80 foot compound, whereas they used to live in much largercompounds of two or three acres with space to farm.Without enough land to continue in their old line of work, the men say they have and to find new jobs.Ko Tu Maing, a 29-year-old resident who moved from Tan Hpre, says he is unhappy in his job as a truck driver and mechanic and wants to return to his old village. Authorities provide rice as compensation – 10 bags a year for his nine family members.“We want whoever wins the election to stop this project. Everybody needs things to change for their future,” he said.In the past, authorities threatened the 80 households that did not move from Tan Hpre, said 35-year-old grocery shop owner Daw Htu Raw.“If it is mandatory we have no choice but to leave our properties, but they haven’t come after us for a long time. The new place is not like they said it would be, and it doesn’t suit us,” she said.“We will vote in this election in the hope that we will be able to live peaceful lives,” she said.Daw Su Su Maw, a 40-year-old vendor who moved from Pyay in Bago Region to Kachin State five years ago, said she was unable to vote in the 2010 election, and was unsure yesterday whether she would be able to vote this time.She sells snacks and alcoholic drinks at a stall beside the Ayeyarwady River close to the site of the suspended project.She has an identity card but did not partake in the nationwide census. Authorities only come to the area to discuss settlement, not for voter education, she said.“I am willing to see a change in government for the benefit of our future. But we are worried that we won’t benefit, whatever the policy changes,” she said.“I think the National League for Democracy could change the situation or even stop the project.”Many others from central Myanmar and the delta region have left their homes to make a living in mining, trade or other jobs in Kachin State, as they can earn more money than in their home towns.Almost 100 migrants from Southern Myanmar live and work along the bank of the river near Myitsone, said Daw Su Su Maw.The Myitsone project, which was set to become one of the world’s largest hydro projects, has been criticised for its negative impact on the environment and local residents, as well as its role in fuelling ethnic conflict.Until recently CPIYN had been lobbying for the dam to be resumed. While the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party has not made a public statement on the project’s future, NLD leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi told an audience in Kachin State last month that she could not promise to cancel it if voted into power.Manam Tu Ja, chair of Kachin Democracy Party, said he will continue to oppose the government on this project.“Even if the project will benefit the people, the government must guarantee their livelihoods,” he said.“The people own these resources. The government cannot sell them without their consent.”","/business/17486-myitsone-villagers-hope-to-return-home.html"
"220",220,"Pilot Yangon bus upgrade to be funded through share sale",2015-11-03,"Business","The public-private partnership formed to introduce a bus rapid transit (BRT) system to Yangon will begin selling shares to the public today.           The company, which was set up with K10 billion from the government and K2.5 million from five private companies, will begin selling shares on November 3, said U Maung Aung, chair of the BRT lite establishment committee, at an investor education event on October 30.He said the company plans to sell 1000 shares at K100,000 each, with shareholders promised annual returns equal to or higher than the Central Bank’s interest rate of 13pc.Investors should think carefully before buying shares, said the president’s economic adviser U Aung Htun Thet, at the event. “The company must also ensure transparency to all shareholders,” he said.The project will cost K25 billion, with the government shouldering 40 percent of the costs, and private investors putting up the remaining 60pc, he said.The plan was first announced in May this year. Known as BRT lite, the system is an abridged and cheaper version of a city-wide bus network plan drawn up by the Japan International Cooperation Agency in 2013.It received the green light from the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration in the last week of October, said Yangon Region Chief Minister U Myint Swe. The government will take responsibility for building supporting infrastructure such as new bus stations, he said.The system will use new buses, which will drive in a dedicated lane on the right hand side of the road. Ordinary buses will have to give priority to the new buses, said company officials. BRT buses will initially run along Pyay Road and Kabar Aye Pagoda Road – the city’s two main thoroughfares.“There are currently 49 daily bus lines running on Pyay Road and 45 on Kabar Aye Pagoda Road, transporting nearly 700,000 commuters every day,” said U Hla Aung, chair of the Yangon Region Supervisory Committee for Motor Vehicles, better known by its Myanmar acronym Ma Hta Tha.“I don’t think the BRT buses will have an impact on the existing bus lines,” he said. If the new system is a success, the government will consider more changes to Yangon’s bus system, but for now existing bus companies will still be able to operate as normal.U Ko Ko Naing, owner of the No 31 buses, said the new scheme will have limited impact. “But we will need to care more about maintenance,” he said. “If not, we won’t be able to compete with the BRT buses – our vehicles are not brand new.”The new project will start small, with buses running four times a day between 6:30am and 9:30pm, each carrying up to 80 people. The company has already bought 65 buses for the initial route, which are expected to start running in early January.Five companies are responsible for supplying the new buses, including Greater Man International Trading which will import a Chinese brand called Higer, and Capital Development which will import China’s King Long city buses.Myanmar Coach Centre Company will import Korea’s Daewoo buses, General Arr Mahn Thit Company will import the Hyundai Super Aero City Bus and Octagon International Services Company will import Scania’s Neo Buses. The buses will arrive in Myanmar at the end of November.Four of the five Myanmar companies have invested capital into the BRT lite venture, with the exception of Greater Man International Trading, said U Maung Aung.He hopes the new buses will reduce commuter travelling time. “People waste two or three hours commuting every day and the existing public buses are not safe. We also hope to make travelling more comfortable,” he said.Under the current system, drivers compete against one another for custom, and are paid according to their success. Drivers of BRT lite buses, on the other hand, will be paid a monthly wage.Commuters agree that it’s time for change. “The buses should be upgraded as soon as possible,” said Ma Hnin Moe from Insein township. “Commuters are spending up to four hours travelling each day. BRT buses will hopefully cut travel time, but the fares should be no more than K500 per journey, so that everyone can afford them.”U Soe Htun, chair of the Myanmar Automobile Manufacturers and Distributors Association, said that as Myanmar is a developing country, people are unable to pay high bus fares. “In other countries, one bus journey can cost between K800 and K1700, but the public here can’t pay this much,” he said.Bus fares in Yangon now range from K100 to K300, he said. “The BRT buses must compromise on fares. If not, some people will be unable to afford to travel.”The BRT fares have not yet been disclosed. The new buses will use an iPay system in addition to collecting fares in cash, said U Maung Aung. Attempts four years to introduce an iPay system were abandoned due to opposition from bus conductors, who feared a loss of earnings.U Maung Aung said that the BRT lite system is the most effective and simplest way to solve traffic jams. Congestion in Yangon is hurting productivity and morale, he said.“We must save Yangon. This project will be carried out regardless of changes in the government [after the November 8 election].”","/business/17329-pilot-yangon-bus-upgrade-to-be-funded-through-share-sale.html"
"221",221,"Norway and MoF plan natural resource fund",2015-10-29,"Business","The Ministry of Finance is researching the potential for a Myanmar natural resource fund, in collaboration with Norway.           Norwegian experts suggested the idea several months ago and have since been collecting data, deputy finance minister U Maung Maung Thein told The Myanmar Times. Meanwhile, the finance ministry has formed a committee, he said.A natural resource fund is a type of sovereign wealth fund – a special-purpose investment vehicle owned by a government, and financed by revenues from oil, gas or mineral sales.The money can be used in a number of ways including covering unexpected budget deficits, ring-fencing resource revenues or saving for future generations, according to non-profit Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI).For economic development and to preserve the country’s natural wealth, “necessary information is being collected to draft a law to govern such a fund”, said U Maung Maung Thein.Despite living in a country with vast natural resources including oil and gas, gold, jade, gems and forests, the people of Myanmar are among the poorest in Asia, he said.Myanmar’s extractive industries are notoriously opaque, though the government has recently voluntarily signed up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), with its first report due next year.None of the ministries governing natural resources, such as the Ministry of Mines or the Ministry of Energy are involved in researching the natural resource fund, said U Maung Maung Thein. “Once we have done the initial research, we will consider which other ministries should be involved,” he said.Finance minister U Win Shein will chair the project’s executive committee and U Maung Maung Thein will chair an implementation committee, with Norwegian experts acting as consultants.Over the past few weeks Norwegian researchers have come up with five main research topics, the deputy finance minister said. These are the source of capital, whether the fund should be held onshore or offshore, who would manage the fund, how it would be spent, and ways to ensure transparency in spending.“Once [the Norwegian researchers] submit their findings in December, the implementation committee will examine them and draft new laws accordingly,” he said, stressing the importance of getting the laws right and educating people, to prevent mistakes.Myanmar does not yet have a sovereign wealth fund. In July, the Norwegian government held a conference in Yangon to create awareness about the potential for such a project.During the event, ambassador Ann Ollestad said that the country’s natural resources belong to the people, and that the focus of such a fund “should be to ensure that the people of Myanmar benefits from the country’s vast resources”, according to a speech later posted on the embassy website.However, Ms Ollestad also noted that a natural resource fund should be established only when a government has a budget surplus.In Myanmar – where the budget deficit is widening fast and may reach 5 percent of GDP this fiscal year – such a fund may not yet be suitable, she said.Questions about how Myanmar’s government is spending the proceeds of its natural wealth are left largely unanswered and data on the value of some of its most profitable industries varies enormously.While Ministry of Mines statistics published in state newspapers on October 24 show sales of minerals, gems, jade and pearls at K3.76 trillion (US$2.9 billion) between financial year 2011-12 and September 2016, a recent report by non-government Global Witness claimed that the jade industry was worth up to $31 billion last year alone.Chinese import figures for last year value Myanmar jade at $12.3 billion, while Myanmar’s official data puts exports for the same year at little more than $1 billion.Natural gas revenue figures are less disputed. U Win Myint, director general for the Department of Trade Promotion under the Ministry of Commerce, told The Myanmar Times that gas exports to China and Thailand had earned the government $1.7 billion this financial year to August.Translation by Kyawt Darly Lin","/business/17255-norway-and-mof-plan-natural-resource-fund.html"
"222",222,"China pledges support for next Myanmar government regardless of winner",2015-10-26,"National News","China will support the new government that emerges from next month’s elections in Myanmar no matter which party wins, senior officials told The Myanmar Times in Beijing.          During an interview at a media forum in the Chinese capital last week, Sun Haiyan, director general of the international department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said China’s relations with Myanmar would remain unchanged.“We will support any government, whoever wins the election,” she said.The media forum was a sideline event of the International Conference of Asian Political Parties.The conference was called to help promote China’s ambitious Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative. Attention was also focused on the Chinese-founded Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.A total of 57 countries, including Myanmar, have applied to become founder members. Myanmar will pay US$264.5 million over 10 years as its contribution. Despite widespread interest in the region and beyond, the bank has aroused scepticism in some quarters, with the United States, Japan and Canada refraining from participation.No Myanmar political parties attended the Beijing conference last week due to the event’s proximity to the November 8 election.“We invited both the ruling party and the opposition to send representatives, but they said they could not come because of the election,” said Ms Sun.The once-close relations between Myanmar and its giant neighbour have appeared to cool since the emergence of a new government in Nay Pyi Taw in 2011 and its engagement with the broader international community, especially the United States, Europe and Japan. Within Myanmar, Chinese investments have encountered public opposition, prompting speculation that Beijing might be reconsidering its attitude to Myanmar.In 2011, President U Thein Sein ordered the suspension of the controversial Myitsone dam project in Kachin State amid accusations that the huge hydropower project was having a damaging environmental and social impact.Local residents have also staged repeated protests against the Letpadaung copper mine near Monywa, Sagaing Region, sparking a violent response from the Myanmar government, including the shooting of unarmed demonstrators and the alleged use of white phosphorous against protesting monks.Another controversial Chinese project is the natural gas and crude oil pipeline linking Kyaukpyu in Rakhine State to the Chinese border. Opposition from local people and organisations arose over land compensation and other environmental and social issues.Since February this year, fighting has occurred between the Tatmadaw and ethnic Chinese Kokang insurgents near the border. China launched an official complaint and deployed military aircraft and troops to the border region after Tatmadaw artillery shells fell on Chinese territory, causing casualties among Chinese citizens.If China’s relations with Myanmar are age-old, its interest has been renewed in the light of its southern neighbour’s growing strategic importance as a regional hub. Beijing is concerned to ensure that its intentions and positions are properly understood.“There are problems on both sides,” said Ms Sun. “Some Chinese companies are not behaving well, and our government is training them in the exercise of greater social responsibility.”Other experts agree that the need for Chinese companies investing in Myanmar to behave more responsibly is a major concern.“You could criticise the bad behaviour of some Chinese businesses. They don’t do enough even in their own country. They don’t pay enough attention to environmental protection,” said Yang Rui, host of CCTV English Section, who served as a panellist in one of the media forum discussions.Since Myanmar’s transition got under way, China has sought to maintain close political ties to the government and the Union Solidarity and Development Party, with regular exchanges and reciprocal visits taking place.But last June, Chinese President Xi Jinping also invited National League for Democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to Beijing for talks. It was the first time that China had extended such an invitation to an opposition leader from Myanmar.China also invited U Aye Maung, chair of the Arakan National Party (ANP), to visit in July, apparently to hedge its bets in its dealings with a future Myanmar whose political complexion was changing in unpredictable ways.In addition to protecting its investments, another motive could have been to resolve misunderstandings at a time of rapid and dynamic change in Myanmar. China is talking to representatives of diverse forces and learning how to cope with different voices so as to be able to maintain a steady, healthy and sustainable dialogue between the two governments.Mr Yang said he believed China is quietly acting to position itself in Myanmar so it can weather any future political changes.“We hope for a genuine process of national reconciliation in Myanmar. And we hope that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will play a positive and more powerful role in the future.”","/national-news/17193-china-pledges-support-for-next-myanmar-government-regardless-of-winner.html"
"223",223,"Illicit jade worth $31b a year: report",2015-10-23,"Business","Myanmar's illicit jade trade is controlled by networks of military officials and their business allies, according to a new report, which also values the industry at up to US$31 billion last year alone.           The report, published today by NGO Global Witness, argues that the elites who have the most to lose from an open, fair and peaceful future for the country “also have access to a multi-billion dollar jade ‘slush fund’”.Global Witness said the value of illegal jade in 2014 equates to almost half of Myanmar’s GDP, which the World Bank says was $64.33 billion. The jade figure is also 46 times national spending on health last fiscal year.“Myanmar’s jade business may be the biggest natural resource heist in modern history,” said Juman Kubba of Global Witness.“Since 2011, a rebranded government has told the world it is turning the page on the ruthless military rule, cronyism and human rights abuses of the past. But jade – the country’s most valuable natural resource and a gemstone synonymous with glitz and glamour – reveals a very different reality.”If this vast wealth was fairly distributed among the residents of Kachin, where the mines are located, it could pull the region out of poverty and drive development of the entire country, she said.The sector and its players have received very little attention, partly because a web of obscure companies and proxy owners make it difficult to work out who is making money, said Ms Kubba.However, after extensive research Global Witness claims that “those involved in the jade trade today reads like a who’s who from the darkest days of junta rule in Myanmar”.The families of heavyweights in the former military regime are among the biggest beneficiaries, as well as at least one Union government minister, a Union Solidarity and Development Party powerbroker and serving parliamentarians.None of the individuals or their linked companies could be reached for comment at deadline.Companies including Asia World, Htoo Group and KBZ are among the other players in the jade industry – in some cases through front companies – the report said.A Htoo Group spokesperson said in an emailed statement said that the company focuses on development of the jade industry and finished products, rather than on extraction and sales in Hpakant.“While the other companies extracted thousands of tonnes of jade annually from this area, Htoo Group of Companies’ annual production is just about 20 tonnes at the most,” the spokesperson said.None of the other companies replied to requests for comment by press time.The Tatmadaw too is “helping itself to a gigantic slice of the pie via its own conglomerates and an elaborate extortion racket run by officers in Kachin State”, Global Witness says.A Tatmadaw spokesperson did not respond to questions by press time.A number of Chinese individuals also reportedly play a role – either as backers for local companies, or by taking Myanmar identities – and much financing comes from within China, said the report.Chinese import data indicates gemstone imports from Myanmar were worth $12.3 billion last year, though Global Witness believes that 50 to 80 percent of jade is smuggled across the border. Myanmar official figures for 2013-14 put the trade at barely $1 billion.Sources interviewed by Global Witness describe bribery, tax evasion, market manipulation, money laundering and smuggling.This should sound alarm bells for those hoping to build a peaceful and prosperous future for Myanmar, said the report, this is not just a political issue, but should be a major consideration for international businesses operating in Myanmar.The report names the Coca-Cola Company, which reportedly spent more than $1 million on due diligence but failed to spot its local partner’s interests in the jade industry.Caterpillar, too, reportedly has business relations with the front man for a group of jade companies that Global Witness claims is controlled by drug lord Wei Hsueh Kang, a commander in the United Wa State Army who is wanted by US authorities. Spokespeople for both companies told The Myanmar Times that they have conducted comprehensive due diligence and are committed to transparency.Local destructionThe negative impact on local communities cannot be overstated, said the report, which cites fatally dangerous conditions around the jade mines, and endemic drugs and prostitution.“The elites cream off vast profits while local people suffer terrible abuses and see their natural inheritance ripped out from beneath their feet,” it said.“Those who stand in the way of the guns and machines face land grabs, intimidation and violence.”The majority of the jade is excavated at Hpakant in Kachin State by migrant workers, with locals “systematically cut out of the business”.Elites on both sides continue to benefit from the industry since the war in Kachin State reignited in 2011, Global Witness said, creating incentives for military commanders and hardliners to prolong the conflict.Furthermore, according to the report, extraction in Hpakant has intensified over the past year. “Now jade mountains disappear in just a few days,” one jade businessman is quoted as saying.Licences only last for three to five years, creating incentives for businesspeople to grab as much of the precious stone as they can, as quickly as possible.According to Global Witness, while the situation is dire, all is not lost. It argues that resource sharing must be addressed immediately “and built into a comprehensive peace agreement to end the conflict”.Change is urgently needed, said Ms Kubba. Reformers within the government have already signed Myanmar up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) – an international scheme aimed at halting corruption and abuse in the oil, gas and mining sectors.“EITI offers a credible framework for change, but unless officials take urgent steps to implement its recommendations openly and fully in the jade business, the process risks being a sham,” said Ms Kubba. Htoo Group is a surprising early champion of transparency, she said. The company – owned by well-known businessperson U Tay Za, has disclosed data on its jade mining interests.Peace negotiations are also a chance to increase transparency – greater involvement from local people is necessary for a new model of shared ownership, management and revenue distribution, it said.The jade industry is also an important test of US foreign policy in Myanmar, said Ms Kubba. The US supports EITI and has sanctions on the jade sector “imposed during the Than Shwe dictatorship to deny money and power to abusive members of the military junta”.However, in many cases, these sanctioned individuals continue to rake in billions of dollars – as do others who are under US sanctions for their roles in the drugs trade.Global Witness has asked the US along with other international governments to benchmark sanctions against reforms in the jade sector. Priorities should include sharing control and benefits with people in Kachin State, and making businesses accountable to the public, it said.“The US is uniquely placed to help take the jade out of the hands of the military, cronies and drug lords. It must make this a priority for its partnership with the new government that emerges from November’s elections,” said Ms Kubba.   A US embassy spokesperson said he had read the report, and that remaining sanctions are carefully targeted, including investment with the military, as well as a general prohibition on importing jadeite and rubies mined or extracted from Myanmar into the US, including jewellery containing such gems. “The US government remains committed to breaking the link between conflict, violence and natural resources. The purpose of maintaining the current sanctions on jadeite and rubies is to encourage the government to make reforms that would address continuing concerns about management of the gem sector, including violations of land rights, corruption and lack of transparency,” he said.“We will continue to support those promoting reform and taking positive steps to operate in a transparent and accountable manner.”","/business/17158-illicit-jade-worth-31b-a-year-report.html"
"224",224,"CPI calculates cost of Myitsone Dam",2015-10-08,"Business","CPI Yunnan International Power Investment Company (CPIYN) has recalculated its spending on the suspended Myitsone hydropower project, and is waiting for the government to approve the figure.           CPIYN is the majority shareholder in Upstream Ayeyarwady Confluence Basin Hydropower Company (ACHC), the dam’s developer.The calculation was made in coordination between the Chinese and Myanmar parties, according to a company official who preferred not to be named.“About US$800 million has been spent on the project,” he said.The huge hydropower dam in Kachin State was temporarily halted by President U Thein Sein in 2011, around six months after he took office, on the back of widespread local opposition.The project has been criticised for its impact on the environment and local residents, and its role in fuelling ethnic conflict, as well as a lack of transparency in the way the contract was awarded.It was set to become one of the world’s largest hydropower plants with an installed capacity of 6000 megawatts.The CPIYN official did not explain the reason for calculating the project’s expenses. However, according to the contract, Myanmar’s government is required to compensate the Chinese state-owned electricity giant if the project is permanently cancelled.Until recently CPIYN had been lobbying for the dam to be resumed, and last year hired British reputation management company Bell Pottinger to manage its public relations, though the contract ended in July this year.CPIYN officials declined to comment on the potential value of a settlement, and said they could not confirm whether the project will be resumed or scrapped altogether.This largely depends upon the new government. President U Thein Sein said the project would be halted for the duration of his term, leaving the decision in the hands of whoever takes power after the November 8 polls.He discussed the project with the chair of CPI in a visit to China for “the 70th anniversary of the victory of the world anti-fascist war” in Beijing in September 3.CPIYN officials did not comment on what had been discussed at the meeting, but said they have not received any instruction to halt the calculation of expenses.In a joint announcement issued after the president’s visit, both countries said they plan to increase cooperation in “agriculture, power production capacity, finance etc, for common development and the well-being of the two peoples”.While the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party has not made a public statement on the future of the dam, opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi answered questions on the project’s future during her campaign in Kachin State earlier this month.Asked if she would re-start the project if the National League for Democracy was voted into power – during a question-and-answer session in the state capital Myitkyina – she made no commitment.She promised to publish details of the $3.6 billion contract between the government and CPIYN, but added, “It would be irresponsible to make promises without knowing the details of the contract. I promise to do what I can, but I’m not going to promise what I cannot deliver. That would be cheating.”She pointed out that the government would have to pay compensation if the dam is stopped, and asked for residents’ “consideration”.CPIYN officials said that the company has faced difficulties since the project was suspended.Several people within the Ministry of Electric Power including permanent secretary U Htein Lwin declined to answer inquiries about the recalculation of expenditure.Currently 27 employees including seven Chinese staff are based at the site of the Myitsone hydropower project, to work on social relations, said the CPIYN official.“It is not possible to withdraw the Chinese staff, as local villagers have been relocated and we need to take care of their social affairs,” he said.Over 2100 people from five villages have been relocated to two resettlement sites, Wang Ping, chief of the department of public affairs at CPIYN, previously told The Myanmar Times.To facilitate the entire project, which includes six other large dams as well as Myitsone, 18,000 people would need to be relocated from 53 villages – 11,000 of these from the Myitsone area.Since the project was suspended four years ago, many relocated villagers have returned to their homes to work on the farms and some have opened restaurants and shops.However, residents said several months ago that authorities have tried to prevent them from returning, in case the project is resumed after U Thein Sein’s term.The Myitsone Hydropower Project is situated at the confluence of the Malikha and Maykha rivers and is the largest of seven dams slated to be built along the Ayeyarwady, Malikha and Maykha rivers.The Chibwe Dam is the only project that has gone ahead, and began operations last month. “Chibwe is producing only 25 percent of its capacity and supplying electricity to Myitkyina,” said the CPIYN official.CPIYN is the majority shareholder in ACHC, a joint venture between the Ministry of Electric Power (15 pc), CPIYN (80pc) and Myanmar Asia World Company (5pc).","/business/16882-cpi-calculates-cost-of-myitsone-dam.html"
"225",225,"World Bank slashes growth forecast",2015-10-06,"Business","The World Bank has slashed Myanmar’s economic growth forecast to 6.5 percent for this financial year, citing nationwide flooding and a slowdown of investments linked to next month’s election and the subsequent political transition.           Just four months ago the World Bank predicted in its Global Economic Prospects report that Myanmar would grow at 8.2pc this year and 8.0pc in fiscal 2017, to become the world’s fourth-fastest-growing economy.However, this outlook took a hit as floods swept the country in July and August, destroying almost 1 million acres of crops and affecting more than half of Myanmar’s 51.4 million people.The 6.5pc forecast is subject to revision as more details emerge on the impact of the floods, the World Bank said in its 2015 Myanmar Economic Monitor.The latest forecast puts the World Bank at odds with more optimistic growth predictions made recently by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).The World Bank said that while output in manufacturing and industry has been strong over the past few years – thanks to gas in particular – investment in these sectors is also likely to remain slower until the political transition runs its course after the November 8 election.The formation of a new government after the elections, involving parliament’s selection of a president in early 2016, could take about five months in all – a long transition and period of uncertainty that has led many investors to put plans on hold.The run-up to voting has already seen problems emerge with the electoral system, with large numbers of eligible voters not registered on electoral rolls.The Bank said investment in light manufacturing and construction also began to slow at the start of this year, linked in part to uncertainties over the transition.Inflation is likely to increase to an average of 11.3pc due to supply pressures caused by the floods and currency depreciation, said the World Bank. The kyat has fallen by around 25pc versus the US dollar since January to K1287 yesterday, according to the Central Bank of Myanmar’s reference rate.Depreciation is due to “a general strengthening of the US dollar, a growing current account deficit, and slowing foreign investment inflows in the run up to the elections”.While fiscal policy is likely to remain on track, the current account deficit is likely to widen further from over 6pc of GDP in fiscal year 2015, due to slowing agricultural exports and import demand for post-flood rehabilitation, the Bank said.In contrast to the World Bank, the IMF predicted last month that growth would remain buoyant at 8.5pc this fiscal year due to expansionary macroeconomic policies, including a widening fiscal deficit. However, this was based on data collected in June, when the World Bank’s forecast was also much higher.The IMF forecast a fiscal deficit of 5pc by year-end, with a current account deficit of 9pc of GDP and foreign currency reserves falling to 2.5 months worth of imports. The Central Bank will require significant financing as a result and credit growth will accelerate, leading to strong inflationary pressures, it said.Warning of overheating, the IMF added that inflation would reach 13pc by year-end and recommended authorities urgently tighten monetary policy.In September, the ADB also forecast that Myanmar’s economy would grow at 8.2pc this fiscal year, pending data outcomes and the results of the election.It also warned against rapid credit growth, an expansionary budget and widening trade deficit, advising that monetary and fiscal policy should be tightened to dampen inflationary pressures and stabilise exchange rate expectations.The IMF, the World Bank and the ADB agree that Myanmar is facing a number of external challenges. Growth in China will slow to 6.9pc this year, according to the World Bank, which could adversely affect demand for Myanmar’s merchandise exports.The Bank cut regional growth forecasts to 6.5pc yesterday and advised developing economies in East Asia and the Pacific to reduce the impact of a slowdown in Chinese growth through “prudent macroeconomic management … and deeper structural reform, focused on encouraging private investment”.Low international commodity prices will also affect Myanmar’s gas exports, though these could be offset by higher output from the Shwe and Zawtika gas fields, and also by higher kyat earnings from gas as a result of currency depreciation, said the World Bank.Natural gas is Myanmar’s largest export commodity and is an important driver of government revenues and economic growth.The exchange rate could also be hit further, pushing up import costs, when the US Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates from the 0-0.25pc range, which could happen as soon as December.Over the medium term, economic growth is likely to pick up again, assuming continued progress on economic reforms and a smooth transition to the new government, said the World Bank.Assuming a well-managed transition and progress in economic reforms, the agriculture sector should bounce back quickly, and services should continue to grow at a strong pace, driven by developments in the telecommunications and banking sectors, the World Bank said.“Manufacturing and industry are also expected to pick up post elections, particularly as recent investments in light manufacturing, such as garments, begin their operations in newly established economic zones.”While medium-term growth prospects are strong, addressing the impact of flooding on poor households will be a challenge.“The floods have hit two of the poorest States in Myanmar, namely Rakhine and Chin, which have been declared as natural disaster zones,” said the World Bank.“Loss of livelihoods has been compounded by loss of assets and reduced access to social services. This will require a strong public sector response.”Estimates of the budget out-turn for fiscal year 2015 suggest government efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal stance, in the face of growing public sector demands, said the report.While revenue performance was partly propped up by telecoms licence receipts, tax reforms are beginning to translate into higher revenue collections.In future, it will be important to maintain exchange rate flexibility, and implement new prudential regulations in the banking sector to avoid a build-up of risks, and to gradually eliminate monetary financing of the budget deficit by the Central Bank.“Strong growth prospects assume continued progress on structural reforms,” said the report. The recent adoption of a minimum wage should be supported by strong institutional arrangements to make sure labour markets are efficient.“Efforts to address access to finance are another priority,” the World Bank said. “This remains a big constraint, particularly for poorer households.”","/business/16833-world-bank-slashes-growth-forecast.html"
"226",226,"Malaysia seeks new trade and business opportunities",2015-10-05,"Business","Malaysian businesses are seeking new opportunities in Myanmar as falling oil prices dent export figures and the domestic economy is hit by a slowdown in Chinese growth.          The price of crude oil and palm oil has dramatically fallen over the past year, hurting export values, said Wan Latiff Wan Musa, senior director at the Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (MATRADE).Refined petroleum products, edible vegetable oils and other hydrogenated oils, all of which have been hit by falling prices, are a major component of Malaysia’s exports to Myanmar, he said.On the other hand, exports of processed food to Myanmar have risen, along with chemical products and machinery, though these comprise just a small part of the total.According to the most recent figures from Myanmar’s Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) in March, Myanmar imported US$6.18 million worth of edible vegetable oil and other hydrogenated products from Malaysia and $4.74 million of refined mineral oil.Imports of chemical elements and compounds were worth $1.1 million, and machinery imports $1.31 million.“Trade relations and business relationships between the two countries can only go up - they cannot go down,” said Wan Latiff Wan Musa.Bilateral trade between the two countries was $972.1 million in 2014, around 6.6 percent higher than in 2013, according to the Department of Statistics, Malaysia.Until June 2015, Malaysia was the seventh-largest investor in Myanmar, having invested around $1.66 billion, according to the CSO.However, Malaysian companies must continue to visit Myanmar to prove they are serious about doing business, said Wan Latiff Wan Musa. “If we don’t come, we will not have opportunities. Big or small, we must build trust with our partners.”MATRADE ran the fourth Malaysia SME Products & Services Exhibition from September 30 to October 3 at Tatmadaw Hall in Yangon.“At last year’s exhibition we were looking at $290 million worth of business opportunities and we are looking to achieve at least the same level this year,” he said.Thirteen Malaysian companies are currently investing in Myanmar – the largest is state-owned energy giant Petronas which is involved in the exploration and production of oil and gas and is considering moving into the assembly of cars and construction projects, said Wan Latiff Wan Musa.MATRADE wants to encourage more companies to become actively involved in Myanmar, particularly in the services sector, he said.Around 50 companies offering services such as construction, healthcare, education, business services and logistics are exhibiting at this year’s showcase. However, this is lower than last year’s turnout of 70 exhibitors.“Our expectations are very high, and we’ve had a good response from Myanmar companies,” said Wan Latiff Wan Musa.“We see Myanmar as a fast developing market. As far as services are concerned, we have a great deal of experience and are able to form reliable partnerships and to help with technology and capacity.”Malaysia generally has more success when offering services than products, he added.He does not believe the general election on November 8 will have any significant impact on the business environment. “We remain neutral, and I am confident the election will run smoothly. We look forward to growing our business relationship with Myanmar after the election, and are not worried at all,” he said.MATRADE’s CEO Dato Dzulkifli Mahud said that with the launch of the ASEAN Economic Community this year, there will be more opportunities for border trade and investment within the wider market.“As Malaysia is a leading country in terms of trade, with technology and experience, we are ready to assist Myanmar companies through collaboration and partnership,” he said.","/business/16810-malaysia-seeks-new-trade-and-business-opportunities.html"
"227",227,"Ethnic Chinese hope for an NLD victory",2015-10-05,"National News","For many elderly ethnic Chinese residents of Yangon, the anti-Chinese riots of 1967 are still a fresh wound. It is widely believed that the military government deliberately stoked the violence in an attempt to divert attention from the deteriorating economy. The anti-Chinese sentiment fomented by the regime continues to reverberate, and many of the ethnic Chinese in Yangon consider a vote for the ruling party, the brainchild of then-Senior General Than Shwe, unthinkable.           In a busy morning market in Chinatown, it was “Mother Suu”, as opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is often called by her supporters, who had the community talking.“The NLD is our only hope for change. The old government did not care, not only about Burmese-Chinese, but about anyone,” said U Htoo Htoo, who is ethnically Chinese and witnessed the riots as a young boy.Sitting in a Chinese temple enveloped in a scent of incense, he recalls how Chinese-owned shops in the city were destroyed. “The soldiers were behind [the rioters]. They didn’t stop them. They let them continue without constraint,” he said.During the years that followed, the Chinese community kept a low profile, trying not to attract any unwanted attention. Whereas most ethnic and religious minorities in Myanmar have an organisation advocating for their rights, no such form of support seems to exist for the Chinese. The Chinese embassy also appears to have distanced itself from the community.“We are not strong enough to oppose the government, so we have to vote for the NLD because they are strong,” U Htoo Htoo said.In Chinatown, Myanmar’s ethnic Chinese live behind grilled doors and windows. They are citizens and have been in the country for generations, their lives interwoven with Myanmar society. They wear longyis and speak Myanmar, as well as Chinese. Even though most describe themselves as Myanmar rather than Chinese, they feel their country continues to regard them as foreigners.“We are not seen as Burmese, [but] still as Chinese, even though we have lived here for a long time,” said a 60-year-old shop owner in Yangon, who requested anonymity.“I was a child [during the riots] and I didn’t understand, but I was scared and saw people being hit and killed,” the woman said. The violence motivated her to learn how to speak and read Chinese, thinking it would enable her to leave the country. But while her parents have emigrated, her marriage has kept her in Myanmar. Her language skills she later used to work as an interpreter in a garment factory.Most ethnic Chinese in downtown Yangon do not dare to speak so openly about their insular community’s fears and politics. Many agreed to speak to The Myanmar Times only under the condition that their name not be published, because they fear reprisal from the authorities.Not all Chinese in Myanmar are full citizens – some are working in the country illegally, while others, until recently, held temporary identity cards also called white cards. An unknown number of Chinese were blocked from voting in the coming elections by the government’s decision earlier this year to invalidate these white cards and disenfranchise wide swathes of minority voters. The Muslim Rohingya community, living mainly in northern Rakhine State, was most widely affected by the sweeping identity card overhaul.Myanmar’s ethnic Chinese population is mainly concentrated in the country’s second-largest city, Mandalay, which is perched on the border with China’s Yunnan province. The ethnic Chinese families dominate the commercial sector, mainly in the trade of jade and timber.“Mandalay is surrounded by the Bamar, but occupied by the Chinese” is a joke often made as large swathes of the ancient capital are now predominantly Chinese. Though official ethnicity figures from the 2014 census have yet to be released, some have estimated as much as 40 to 50 percent of the city is now ethnically Chinese.In Yangon, Chinese traders said they struggled to work under the decades of oppression, but that business is now finally picking up again.“My father had a big shop, but it was nationalised. After that we could only have a small business because large businesses were always investigated by the authorities,” said a trader who declined to give his name.Under President U Thein Sein’s government, anti-Chinese sentiment has been resurging, mainly as a result of controversial investment projects, like the Letpadaung copper mine in Myanmar’s northern Sagaing Region, that are backed by the Chinese government. At the Chinese-operated mine, a female protestor was killed in December last year after being fatally shot by police. In May of the same year, two Chinese workers were kidnapped by angry farmers at the mine, who have been protesting against land confiscations. The workers were released unharmed a day later.In February, anti-Chinese sentiment was further fuelled by fighting between the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Tatmadaw in northern Myanmar near the Chinese border. Beijing has denied involvement with the ethnic Chinese rebel group, while the Tatmadaw has used the conflict as a PR war, with some success.In July, 150 Chinese illegal loggers were sentenced to life imprisonment – the harshest penalty ever meted out to timber smugglers. But after Beijing lobbied for leniency, they were released a month later during a presidential amnesty. The decision drew ire within the country, as floods, partially a consequence of unchecked logging, hit most states and regions, and affected more than 1 million people.In Yangon, the ethnic Chinese community is divided over whether the resurfacing of anti-Chinese sentiment poses a threat to their safety. Many don’t think the government would dare risk its profitable relationship with China by targeting the community. “I don’t think this will happen, because some government people are sharing in the profits of the Chinese projects,” said U Htoo Htoo.But others are not so positive. “In 1967 the problem was between the Burmese, but the anger was directed toward the Chinese. Now we are in danger for the same problem,” said the 60-year-old shop owner.","/national-news/16823-ethnic-chinese-hope-for-an-nld-victory.html"
"228",228,"Negotiation impasse for China oil pipeline",2015-09-25,"Business","Myanmar and China need to return to the negotiating table to finalise the terms of the controversial cross-Myanmar oil pipeline, according to senior officials.          While the South East Asia Crude Oil Pipeline (SEAOP) has been essentially completed since the start of 2015, and its sister natural gas pipeline is already operating, there remain unresolved arguments on investment and tax terms, officials told The Myanmar Times.The pipeline provides a shortcut for Middle Eastern crude oil to reach China. Rather than being shipped south around Singapore, it can be offloaded on Made Island in Rakhine State and sent via a 700-kilometre pipeline across Myanmar to its terminus in China’s Yunnan province.A trial operation was launched in January, but agreements with Myanma Port Authority to offload crude at Made Island and a transportation agreement with China National United Oil Corporation (Chinaoil) require further government-to-government discussions.“It is now beyond our capability to decide on a deal for the project,” said an official from Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise, which holds a 49.1 percent stake in the project. He declined to be indentified as he is not allowed to speak to the media.The agreement to build the pipeline was inked in 2008, with construction essentially completed earlier this year.“Discussions with the Myanma Port Authority to use Made Island Port ended without any result,” the official said. “It is beyond our level to negotiate.”Similarly, discussions with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), another shareholder and the main operator of pipeline, could not be completed due to concerns on taxation and other charges relating to the pipeline project, which were originally completed during the time of the previous government.The Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise official said that some of the agreement terms are no longer relevant in a changing Myanmar, while there is still disagreement over various fees and taxes.The pipeline had cost US$2.45 billion to construct, with CNPC holding 50.9pc and the rest held by Myanmar. The pipeline is designed to transport 22 million tonnes of crude annually. Myanmar’s first international oil unloading terminal on Made Island is at one end of the pipeline, and includes 12 oil storage tanks, a dockyard and a sea port with a 480-metre terminal.Speaking at a soft opening ceremony in January for the Made Crude Oil Unloading Terminal and Pipeline, U Nyan Tun, vice president and chair of the National Energy Management Committee, said the project will promote the country’s economy and develop pipeline crossing areas.China became the world’s largest energy consumer in 2011 and is the world’s second-largest crude oil consumer after the United States. It imported an average of nearly 6.2 million barrels per day of crude in 2014, a 10pc increase on 5.6 million barrels in 2013, according to a report from the US Energy Information Administration.The Myanmar-China crude pipeline was intended as one of China’s main oil import links. China National Petroleum Corporation plans to send crude from the pipeline to service a Yunnan refinery which is slated to open in 2016, as well as a Chongqing refinery which is to begin operations in 2017, according to a May 2015 report.Yet the Yunnan refinery is still under construction, according to a Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise official.“The refinery is still being constructed,” he said. “This is one of the factors delaying the project, while another is the fall in crude oil prices.”Still, the project has attracted a large share of controversy. It is one the most well-known China-backed projects in Myanmar, and has been the target of opposition from the public and from non-government organisations.In 2011, one of the first acts of President U Thein Sein was to suspend another large Chinese project, the Myitsone hydrodam in Kachin State. That project had come under attack from concerns over its environmental and social impact. Similar, the government renegotiated terms at the Letpadaung copper mine in 2013.The 771km crude pipeline was tipped as a revenue generator for Myanmar. The country was to direct obtain a road-right fee of $13.81 million from both the gas and oil pipelines each year, as well as a transit fee of $1 per tonne of crude oil transmitted to China under a 30-year concession agreement.However, authorities have never fully disclosed the exact income and profit sharing from the project, with detailed information behind the agreement not publically released by either side.Industry observers have questioned the pipeline.“Some previously approved projects have some social and environmental concerns,” said U Pyi Wa Tun, chief executive officer of Parami Energy. “In addition, for some projects we are not clear about the economic benefit for Myanmar.” He added a possible change of government can be quite risky for investors and developers.Risks can be minimised with the inclusion of multilateral associations such as the World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Asian Development Bank. “They can bring best practices from around the world to address community participation, environmental issues and economic benefit for the people of Myanmar,” he said.The pipeline project has providence $13.26 million for corporate social responsibility programs to date. It will improve the wellbeing of local people as well as create employment and assist the country’s economy, according to previous information from SEAOP.The Myanmar Times requested the SEAOP consortium provide an update the pipeline’s status last month. In a partial reply on September 22, the company said the process is still being discussed.“The preparation for full operation is completed. The pipeline is ready to pump crude oil, but no date has been selected for operations of transferring and pumping,” a representative said. No further information was provided.","/business/16697-negotiation-impasse-for-china-oil-pipeline.html"
"229",229,"ADB downgrades regional growth on slowing China, India",2015-09-23,"Business","Weaker growth in China this year is expected to cause a slowdown in the rest of Asia, the Asian Development Bank said yesterday as it became the latest major body to revise down its forecasts for the world’s number two economy.          It also warned central banks to prepare for an expected Federal Reserve interest rate rise, with many nations already seeing huge capital outflows as dealers look for safer US investments.The report comes as markets have been hit by extreme volatility driven by fears over the Chinese economy – and its leaders’ management of it – after last month’s surprise devaluation of its yuan currency.“The combination of a moderating prospect in China and India, together with delayed recovery of advanced countries, weighed on our forecast for the region as a whole,” said ADB chief economist Shang-Jin Wei, who presented the report at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong.In an update to its flagship Asian Development Outlook released in March, the Bank said growth in the region would hit 5.8 percent this year and 6.0pc in 2016. March’s forecast was for 6.3pc for both years.Myanmar’s GDP growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016 were held steady at 8.3pc and 8.2pc respectively, pending data outcomes and the results of the November election, the report said. Still, the report noted several risks, such as rapid credit growth, an expansionary budget and widening trade deficit, as well as noting that a prolonged decline in natural gas prices would erode its fiscal and external position.“The economy as a whole nevertheless continues to expand at a robust pace on investment stimulated by structure reform and generally strong domestic demand,” it said.“Fiscal policy and expanded credit are contributing to growth, though both fiscal and monetary policy will likely need to be tightened in the forecast period to dampen inflationary pressures and to stabilise exchange rate expectations.”Myanmar inflation also accelerated year-on-year in May 2015 to 8pc, while disruptions of food and other goods from recent flooding could add to the pressure, the report said.Inflation in the developing Asia region was forecast to ease further, partly due to lower global commodity prices.Mr Wei said that the overall outlook for the region was “still positive” but had been impacted by capital flow reversals and weakened commodity prices for exporters, partly related to the China slowdown.“Developing Asia is expected to continue to be the largest contributing region to global growth despite the moderation,” he added.However, it tipped China – the main driver of global economic growth – to expand 6.8pc this year, instead of the 7.2pc previously estimated, following a stream of weak indicators including on trade, inflation, investment and consumer spending.The ADB predicted growth rate would be the slowest since 1990, a year after the Tiananmen Square crackdown that led to global sanctions against Beijing. It is also below China’s official target for the year of “about” 7pc.But Mr Wei said talk of a collapse in Chinese growth was “overblown”.“Consumption growth continues to look relatively strong. Retail sales look relatively resilient ... Job market employment looks relatively resilient,” he said.Mr Wei added that stocks volatility was unlikely to have a long-lasting effect on growth.It added that Southeast Asia was bearing the brunt of China’s slowdown, with growth in Southeast Asia this year put at 4.4pc, before rising to 4.9pc in 2016.Jurgen Conrad, head of the ADB’s economic unit, told reporters in Beijing that the revision was “mainly due to the delayed recovery in industrial countries reducing export demand”.Last week the OECD cut its 2015 growth forecast for China by 0.1pc points to 6.7pc.Forecasts for India were also lowered to 7.4pc from 7.8pc, weighed by the slow pace of reform by the new government and weak external demand, the report said.The ADB urged regional central banks to move now on monetary policy to prepare for a US rate hike, which Fed chief Janet Yellen has said will come before the end of the year.“To counter the impacts of a US rate rise, monetary policy authorities in developing Asia will need to find a balance between stabilising the financial sector and stimulating domestic demand,” the report warned.A tightening of US monetary policy would likely lead to the flight of much-needed capital from developing nations as traders move into the US in search of better returns.This would in turn put pressure on central banks to lift rates themselves in a bid to protect their currencies, at a time when they are struggling to kickstart tepid growth at home.World markets were rocked after the Fed on September 17 held off announcing a rise, with Ms Yellen citing the threats to the US economy caused by China’s economy as a key reason for the decision.Additional reporting by Jeremy Mullins","/business/16637-adb-downgrades-regional-growth-on-slowing-china-india.html"
"230",230,"UMFCCI official calls for help from neighbours on smuggling",2015-09-22,"Business","Neighbouring countries need to rein in their illegal trading to prevent further damage in Myanmar, according to a senior businessperson.          U Aye Lwin, joint secretary general of Myanmar business association UMFCCI, called on neighbouring countries to take responsibility for smuggling and enforce the rules, during a presentation at the 12th China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit taking place in Nanning. The summit is a sister event to the larger 12th China-ASEAN Expo, which is taking place concurrently.U Aye Lwin showed photos of illegal timber trading between Myanmar and its neighbours, China, Bangladesh and Thailand. He claimed the trade leads to extensive deforestation, pointing out that the lack of trees made the flooding much worse in July and August.It is illegal to export unprocessed timber from Myanmar, while processed exports are supposed to only leave the country by sea from Yangon. However, a report published earlier this month by the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency showed that illegal timber trading with China is worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year, and is rapidly depleting the country’s forests.U Aye Lwin also said some foreign traders from neighbouring countries bully their Myanmar counterparts. Some Myanmar traders have fixed prices for melons with Chinese traders, only to arrive in China with the goods and have the Chinese traders demand a price reduction. Myanmar traders have no choice but to then sell the goods or abandon them, as they cannot return to Myanmar with the melons, said U Aye Lwin.He also pointed to Thai traders exporting expired fertiliser and frozen meat to Myanmar.“I am not complaining about it, I am just sharing the information. It is not for us but for the next generations. All of you should think about it. This is very important. We need legal enforcement,” he said, to an assembled group of high-ranking officials and traders from neighbouring countries.“I think good governments prevent illegal and informal trade. And then governments need to take action by law, and protect those who follow the law.”Following U Aye Lwin’s presentation, Chinese audience members declined to comment.U Aye Lwin told The Myanmar Times that he had been wanting to talk about this issue for a long time, and finally received his opportunity.“The authorities of our country do not rule by law. They are doing their job as a kind of nepotism, and are forgetting about the law,” he said. “All they need to do is enforce the law.”While U Aye Lwin’s comments cast a shadow over the event, it was not the only item being discussed. China and ASEAN signed a memorandum of understanding for legal cooperation, and participants also discussed establishing a cross-border business-to-business platform.U Than Maung, a legal expert with UMFCCI’s Legal Affairs Committee, told The Myanmar Times that the memorandum is a starting point to prevent illegal activities by traders between China and ASEAN. “Currently, if someone is blacklisted in China, he or she can still run a business in Myanmar or other countries. In the future, we will be able to protect against that,” he said.U Than Maung added the legal cooperation will be between China and all ASEAN members, and will also provide another legal recourse if problems arise.“If someone breaks Myanmar’s business law and goes back to China, we can sue and charge them under our country’s law in the future, because of this legal cooperation,” he said. “It is likely it can prevent inappropriate trading and legal abuse in each country.”","/business/16595-umfcci-official-calls-for-help-from-neighbours-on-smuggling.html"
"231",231,"Myanmar risks overheating: IMF",2015-09-21,"Business","Myanmar's economy is showing strong signs of overheating and has become increasingly vulnerable over the past 12 months amid rising macroeconomic imbalances, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).          An expansionary budget and limited monetary policy tools will see inflation at 13 percent by year-end, the IMF said in its annual 2015 Article IV Consultation report, which advises authorities to urgently tighten monetary policy.By the end of the year, Myanmar will also have a fiscal deficit of almost 5pc and a current account deficit of around 9pc of GDP, with foreign currency reserves falling to 2.5 months of imports.However, medium to long-term prospects remain “favourable”, assuming continued structural reforms, foreign direct investment and macroeconomic stability. Industry sources said this outlook is somewhat optimistic.The economy is set to grow by 8.5pc this year – reflecting expansionary macroeconomic policies, including a widening fiscal deficit. Myanmar is likely to be the world’s fourth fastest growing economy until 2017, according to the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report, published in June.In financial year 2015 (FY2015), Myanmar’s fiscal deficit grew to 3pc of GDP and its current account deficit widened to 6pc of GDP. As deficits continue to grow, the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) will require significant financing at around 1pc of GDP and credit growth will accelerate, resulting in strong inflationary pressures.Credit to the private sector grew by 35pc last fiscal year. Inflation rose to 8pc year-on-year in May, up from 4pc last October, and will continue to rise this fiscal year to reach 13pc, said the IMF.A senior CBM official told The Myanmar Times yesterday that while the economy is not yet overheating, “signs of economic overheating may be evident due to constantly high economic growth”. As a side effect, inflation is inevitable, he added.The IMF notes the exchange rate has also been under strong downwards pressure, depreciating by around 25pc this year, to K1292 to the US dollar yesterday, according to the CBM rate.In a private briefing on the foreign exchange market seen by The Myanmar Times in July, the IMF raised concerns that the CBM had moved away from its managed floating exchange rate system introduced three years ago, and that economic reforms were stalling.At the time, the CBM was keeping the exchange rate artificially low, leading to a flight to US dollars and a widening gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates. However, since then, the President’s Office stepped in and adjusted the official rate to meet the market rate.The IMF said in the September 18 report that it welcomed this move, and noted the importance of maintaining exchange rate flexibility, adding that further reform is needed to bolster regulatory capacity at the “relatively weak” CBM, particularly in light of nine licences granted to foreign banks this year.It also stressed the “urgency” of allowing interest rates at Treasury bill auctions to rise, to attract more bidders and reduce the CBM’s role in financing fiscal deficits. The government offers 8.75pc for two-year, 9.0pc for three-year and 9.5pc for five-year bonds, and state-owned Myanma Economic Bank dominates the fortnightly auctions, buying up to 80pc of each issue.The IMF also believes the CBM should also push ahead with plans to enforce higher reserve requirements at banks, to withdraw liquidity from the banking system.Minimum paid-up capital is set to rise to K20 billion (US$15.5 million), with statutory reserves of another K10 billion. Furthermore, the CBM “should be prepared to increase this further and scale up deposit auctions if signs of second-round effects from food price increases on inflation emerge”, said the IMF.Prudential measures should be enforced and state-owned banks and non-bank financial institutions should be a priority for reform, as should tackling money laundering and the financing of terrorism.The IMF also recommends wide-ranging tax reforms. A report released earlier this month by US non-profit Global Financial Integrity finds that illicit, un-taxed inflows from trade misinvoicing average over $8 billion each year. Between 2010 and 2013, lost income from technical smuggling was the equivalent of 129pc of health spending and 42pc of spending on education.Authorities should also tighten monetary policy to reduce macroeconomic vulnerabilities, said the IMF, noting that some flexibility may be needed due to nationwide flooding over the past few months, which could lead to a “spike in demand for liquidity.”The floods have affected 34.6 million of Myanmar’s 51.4 million people, according to a September 16 snapshot by the United Nations. An estimated US$75.5 million is needed to repair the damage, though the indirect impact on the economy is likely to be much higher.Additional downside risks to growth and stability include lower natural gas prices – which have fallen from $3.85 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) this time last year to $2.61 yesterday.Natural gas is Myanmar’s largest export commodity and is a key driver of government revenues and economic growth. Senior official from the Ministry of Energy told The Myanmar Times earlier this year that income from natural gas exports could decrease by $1.5 million a day as the effects of the global price slide kick in.Myanmar’s trade channels are also likely to be impacted by slowing growth in China. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s corruption crackdown in Yunnan province has also made many cross-border traders wary, according to U Shine Zaw Aung, country analyst at Myanmar-focused research firm New Crossroads Asia.“Myanmar’s rice exports have been halted at the border, while Yunnan tycoons – traditionally large buyers of Myanmar’s gems and jade – are trying to be more modest than before,” he said.As the United States tightens monetary policy, the US dollar will strengthen further against the kyat, pushing the costs of imports higher. The Federal Reserve may raise its benchmark rate from the 0-0.25pc range in December for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2008.“A combination of potential shocks – if materialised amid political uncertainty related to the general elections – could severely strain the economy,” said the IMF. In the worst case, the fiscal deficit could rise to over 6pc, the current account deficit could widen to 10pc and CBM reserves could fall to 1.3 months of imports by the end of this fiscal year.“On the other hand, a well-received election outcome and peace process may provide an upside surprise, resulting in higher-than-expected FDI inflows,” said the report, which did not elaborate on this.Foreign investors say FDI inflows will depend on a stronger Central Bank and a potentially protectionist new Foreign Investment Law, which is slated to be passed soon. However, U Aung Naing Oo, director general of the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration last week dismissed concerns of undue protectionism, saying that the government wants to “create a better investment climate”.Others say political and non-commercial issues, such as the political environment, ongoing economic sanctions and human rights concerns will hold back foreign investment.The IMF noted that continued structural reform – including improvement to the business environment, financial inclusion, health services and education – is essential.Sean Turnell, an expert on Myanmar’s economy at Sydney’s Macquarie University and an economic adviser to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, wrote in a post on Facebook yesterday that the macro economy “is set for a wild ride”.He also voiced fears that the IMF report is too sanguine in a number of areas.The first is that it assumes a new banking law will be in place to guard against financial sector instability. “But this will not be in place. Moreover, most banks ignore prudential directives anyway. Significant vulnerabilities here remain,” he said.The second is that IMF urges monetary tightening. “This misses the major issue, which is not monetary in nature, but fiscal. The budget deficit is driving monetary creation, but this in turn is driven by excessive spending on Burma’s coercive apparatus. Military spending ... not a word from the IMF!”Military spending has continued to increase, accounting for 27pc of government spending for fiscal year 2013, according to a July report by the Asian Development Bank.However, the IMF does note that reducing the fiscal deficit is “urgently needed to contain immediate inflationary pressure and anchor exchange rate expectations”, recommending it remains within 4pc of GDP in FY2016, through reducing low-priority spending, “including on goods and services, and travel expenses”.","/business/16567-myanmar-risks-overheating-imf.html"
"232",232,"Let the girls play",2015-09-18,"Sports","Head coach of Myanmar’s national women’s football team has called on the authorities to make good on their promise of regular competitive football for her players following their 2-1 defeat at the hands of neighbours Thailand.           The long-awaited women’s national league has received several knockbacks but is currently slated to begin in January with teams formed by interested clubs and government ministries.Thet Thet Win believes the lack of regular football for Myanmar’s women is at the root of their difficulty to overcome their derby rivals. Thailand have a two-tier women’s football system and have seen that investment pay dividends with a recent visit to the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup in Canada.“Myanmar is lacking the numbers of women footballers to produce a national team for the next generation,” Thet Thet Win said after her side’s loss on September 16 at the Mandalar Thiri Stadium in the second round of the AFC Women’s Olympic Football Qualification.“We only have a pool of about 30 players to choose from and the new generation do not have the experience to fill the positions of our senior squad members.”“Thailand has players competing in international leagues, whereas in Myanmar we don’t even have our own league,” added the experienced coach of the Myanmar side.“We’ll continue to ask for that opportunity. With that anything could be possible.”Referring directly to the defeat, Thet Thet Win explained that she was struggling to keep her team competitive in a tournament situation with her ageing “Daw’s Army”.“This is match is the second in three days for Myanmar, but the first game of the tournament for Myanmar, so the Thai side were a little fresher,” said Thet Thet Win in her post-match press conference.The coach pointed out that while Thailand have been busy playing on the world stage despite attempts her side has lacked a serious build-up to this Olympic qualifier.“Plans were made to visit Japan or China for friendly warm-up matches but the Japanese and Chinese club sides were busy with their own competition so we were left with games against amateur sides in China.“I think ultimately we have entered this competition on the back of weak preparation. In future I’ll be asking the Myanmar Football Federation for more preparation time and more competitive friendlies,” said Thet Thet Win.Before the Thailand game the coach told The Myanmar Times that two key players Khin Marlar Tun and Than Than Htwe having suffered injuries were still lacking full match fitness because of lack of opportunity.Than Than Htwe made an appearance off-the-bench in yesterday’s game as did San San Maw, who had played as captain in the 2-0 defeat of Jordan on September 14 and came on to score Myanmar’s goal.“Our new generation don’t have the experience. Without that they can’t make the required impact on the international stage. This means players like San San Maw are still key to this side even though she is 36. This is very old to still be playing so I can only use her as a substitute,” said the coach.Anootsara Maijarern scored twice, once with her head and once with a free-kick in front of goal before San San Maw brought Myanmar back into the game for the last quarter-hour.Despite Thet Thet Win’s concerns, Thai coach Nuengrutai Srathongvian praised her opposition.“Myanmar’s players know very well about Thailand’s style of play, so it is very difficult to come here and get a win. The Myanmar team are a tougher challenge than they were a year ago,” said Nuengrutai.Thailand will now face bottom-side Jordan on September 18 before current group toppers Chinese Taipei on September 20.“Jordan are a physically strong side whose play on the counter attack is very dangerous,” said the Thai coach, looking forward to this afternoon’s 3:30pm kick-off.Myanmar will face up in the 5:30 pm kick-off against Vietnam, another strong nation that have come off a three-day rest.With only one team advancing to the next round of qualification, Myanmar’s chance has probably gone, but Thet Thet Win will continue to fight in case other results go her side’s way.“This was a great match, but a disappointing result. In our final matches we’ll keep looking for wins and try our best regardless [of qualification].”","/sports/16558-let-the-girls-play.html"
"233",233,"Post 9-11 or Thailand’s Erawan shrine bombing; safety matters",2015-09-16,"Opinion","With Thailand often a gateway by international tourists travelling on to Myanmar, understandable concern exists about any long-term impact of the recent Erawan Shrine bombing in central Bangkok. The questions raised by would be travelers to hotels, travel agencies and reservation agents across Southeast Asia about safety are reminiscent of even more deadly attacks in the United States and Southeast Asia during the last 14 years.          Ever since 2001, thoughts in m New York turn again this time of year to the tragedy of September 11, when terrorists brought down the World Trade Center. Thousands were killed and lives and livelihoods were sent reeling. Here in Asia, the travel and tourism industry was not spared, as Japanese, Koreans and other nationalities joined Europeans and Americans in cancelling business and leisure trips.Economies and businesses slowly recovered. Then, in October 2002 and October 2005, terrorist bombings devastated parts of  the Indonesian resort island of Bali, killing hundreds of tourists and residents.Tourism receipts again spiralled downward.Now, fears have been raised again about travel to Southeast Asia. Where once it might have been Indonesia, or the Philippines given that nation’s longstanding struggles with separatists on the island of Mindanao, this time it was Thailand.After the bombing of the revered religious shrine in central Bangkok, which injured more than 100 and killed 20 people – many of ethnic Chinese origin – Hong Kong quickly raised its  “Outbound Travel Alert” for Bangkok to red. “Residents intending to visit Thailand (Bangkok) should adjust their travel plans and avoid non-essential travel, including leisure travel,” said the official Hong Kong government news release.Arrests and investigations continue to play out as to the who was behind the Bangkok attack, and whether an “international terrorist group” was involved. Regardless, steps will need to be taken on fundamental traveller safety and security issues, including for example addressing broken surveillance cameras, and other shortcomings uncovered so far. And such steps must be taken not just for tourists, but for a city’s own citizens. All lives matter, tourist or resident.So, what more can all the nations of Southeast Asia do as a region to keep travel and tourism as a key economic contributor to local businesses and communities, including in Myanmar? The 10 countries that comprise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, have committed in the past to a vision of “responsible, sustainable and inclusive tourism development”. The need for greater connectivity of Southeast Asia’s diversity of destinations also will be underscored in an “ASEAN Tourism Strategic Plan, 2016-2020” to be launched at the 2016 ASEAN Tourism Forum to be held in the Philippines. But ensuring greater information sharing and other steps to ensure visitor safety is also critical. Policy makers also should recommit to three broad steps to ensure Southeast Asia remains competitive, individually and collectively, and safe as a destination. First, ASEAN member nations must work to build greater flexibility and segmentation into their efforts. The ability of hotels and tour operators, among others, to adapt is critical particularly as the visitor mix evolves.Meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions may well come to the forefront for some destinations. The growing numbers of Chinese tourists and the need to tailor marketing and outreach efforts to their needs, just as has been done for Korean and Japanese visitors in the past, is one clear trend that can be leveraged.  Chinese travelers already now make up about 25 percent of all foreign visitors annually to Thailand, and their presences is being felt across the region. More than 4 million visitors from China travelled to Thailand in the first half of this year alone, and those numbers were expected to grow, prior to the recent bombing. Myanmar too must be prepared for growing numbers but also a shifting makeup of inward-bound visitors’ home countries.Second, all 10 nations of ASEAN must continue to invest in their product offering. This must include finding funds for the maintenance of existing destinations as well as the establishment of new ones. While not every nation will have the resources of a Singapore to fund landmark new attractions such as the city-state’s award-winning Gardens by the Bay, investment and a supporting regulatory environment is critical to ensure continued competitiveness.The need for resources for both development and maintenance also is best addressed by partnership with and involvement of the private sector. Development of a corruption–free, enabling environment for business to succeed must be a clear priority, including in Myanmar.The upcoming “2015 Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix” is just one example of a corporate-supported travel attraction and how public and private sectors can work together. And as hotels and restaurants must reinvest in their properties, so too must government-owned attractions, from national parks to state-funded museums and airports.And third, all of ASEAN must recognise that the region’s sustained attractiveness will be driven by its residents and the services they provide – and then act accordingly. At the heart of Southeast Asia’s attractiveness as a destination must be its people – more than buildings or beaches, no matter how historic or attractive. Educational investments must follow as well as access to capital, with clear metrics for success.For emerging destinations in particular, such as Laos and most definitely including Myanmar, this focus on human resources and capacity building is as critical as any focus on building core physical infrastructure. Community involvement also will be important to build support for nascent travel and tourism efforts and to help ensure tourism dollars stay in the community. Even the richest of ASEAN’s member states also must address the issue of human capital as higher paying industries draw people away.Even amid terrorism worries, Southeast Asia’s attractiveness as a destination rightly endures. Tourism can more than survive. It can continue to thrive, attracting growing numbers from Hong Kong, mainland China, Japan, Korea and elsewhere, even as we mourn the loss of life at Bangkok’s Erawan shrine.But, a focus on strengthened security and basic law and order will be fundamental to the sustained growth of any ASEAN member state’s tourism sector, including Myanmar’s.  Vigilance and preparation are key. And so too, lessons must be learned and acted upon.Curtis S Chin, a former US ambassador to the Asian Development Bank, is managing director of advisory firm RiverPeak Group, LLC.  Follow him on Twitter at @CurtisSChin.","/opinion/16507-post-9-11-or-thailand-s-erawan-shrine-bombing-safety-matters.html"

Instead of earning their first day of the newly implemented K3600 minimum wage, they learned their factory had shut and they were all suddenly out of work amidst an industry-wide gutting of staff.          More than 1000 factory workers have lost their job in the wake of the new minimum wage, according to the Ministry of Labour. Just one factory has so far closed however.U Maung Maung Hlaing, head of the Labour Laws Inspection Department in Hlaing Tharyar township, said the Jasmine Pwint factory shuttered on August 31, the day before the national minimum wage took effect. The factory has not provided an official reason for closing. U Maung Maung Hlaing said repeated requests for information from the factory’s owners have gone unanswered.A total of K200 million of compensation was divvied between the 237 former workers, but job prospects are in short supply as the garment sector undergoes an industry-wide purge to accommodate the new salary floor.“We are trying the best we can to quickly create more jobs for those [laid off] workers,” said U Aung Htey Win, deputy director general of the labour ministry.It’s a stark departure from the burgeoning textile industry’s growth throughout the previous year, when a new factory opened every week according to the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association’s count. But the entry-level wages at those factories were on average 4.5 times less than the new minimum, which is still among the lowest daily salaries in the region.“Some factories paid as little as K450 a day. The payment system relied on overtime and bonuses based on the quantity of garments produced,” said Ko Wai Phyo Maung, leader of the Labour Union Network.While factories are precipitously shedding their workforce, they claim it’s only tangentially related to the minimum wage implementation. It has to do with a recent decline in orders, the factory bosses claim, or a lack of productivity.Factory employers ardently resisted the K3600 wage. Discussions concerning a minimum began years ago, and the Minimum Wage Act was approved in 2013. In July, 200 representatives from the 145 garment factories unanimously voted against the minimum. Citing productivity concerns and unusually high national overtime rates, the factory bosses suggested K2500 or even K1500 would make a more reasonable starting point.But trade groups and big brand-name retailers like GAP and H&M threw their weight behind the minimum wage, and suggested stabilising the strikes and pickets would do more to attract foreign investment than a wage hike could possibly detract from it.But the largely Chinese and South Korean-owned industry is already making good on threats that thousands of jobs would be at stake if the government arm-twisted them into accepting the K3600 wage.“We cannot continue operating the garment business with these runaway costs. Therefore, we have had to lay off the workers and give compensation,” said Ma Myat San Win, director of the UMH garment factory at Shwe Pyi Thar Industrial Zone where more than 400 labourers have been dismissed.She added that the layoffs were attributable to a lack of orders, as Myanmar’s factories must import everything, including the fabric, the designs and any accessories.“Local factories which cannot become self-sufficient will surely be closed down by the minimum wage,” she said.U Aung Lin, chair of the Myanmar Trade Unions Federation, said factories were facing difficulties because of their mismanagement, rather than because of a reasonable and rather low daily minimum.“The garment factory owners do not have good market planning and the government has not limited overcrowding in the industry,” he said. “By comparison, the new minimum wage does not even cover the real living expenses of the workers. Therefore, if the condition was not changed, the labour dispute and unrest would be continuing.”According to global trade unions, the firings and factory closure in the wake of the minimum wage are less the spectre of coming instability than normal road bumps along a well-travelled route to fairer labour practices.“This is normal fluctuation,” said Petra Brannmark, a spokesperson for IndustriALL Global Union, adding that the “lack of managerial competence to make garment factories sustainable” is to blame in many cases.And in neighbouring countries that have experienced the same wage-hike growing pains, the hiccups have hardly crippled the industry.“In Cambodia, minimum wages were raised in two phases by 60 percent over 13 months to US$128 as of January 1, 2015. Despite these considerable increases, the ILO reports that Cambodian garment exports grew by 9.3 pc in 2014, and expanded further by 10.6 pc in the first quarter of 2015,” she said.While the forecast may be bright the factories, the workers say they have gone from cramped spaces,10:55:05 and dangerous conditions to now being unemployed and unable to feed their families.“I can’t afford to complain because most of the laid-off workers did not receive compensation,” said Ko Chit The Aung, a laid-off worker from the Shwe Swan Yee Penan factory in Hlaing Tharyar, referring to the firing of workers with less than six months’ experience who can now be dismissed without compensation.“But the little money I received as compensation is gone now. My family has eight members and we are facing a crisis because of the minimum wage,” he said.Additional reporting by Laignee Barron. Translation by Khin San May","/national-news/yangon/16332-thousands-out-of-work-as-minimum-wage-kicks-off.html"
"235",235,"Mandalay firms fight forex their own way",2015-09-04,"Business","Importers and distributors in Mandalay struggling to keep afloat amid the rising tide of a depreciating currency have taken matters into their own hands.           Betting the US dollar will continue to strengthen against the kyat, importers and distributors are raising prices to beat the exchange rate.“We set the price higher, but then offer promotions for our customers to encourage them to continue buying,” said U Hla Phone Kyaw, director of Rainbow Bridge Distribution Company, which imports high-end brands such as Panasonic and Johnson & Johnson.The discounts depend on the gap between the sales price and the exchange rate. The smaller the difference, the smaller the promotion, Once the market rate overtakes the sales price, it is time to temporarily halt sales and reset the price higher, said U Hla Phone Kyaw. “This has happened two or three times this year,” he said.For two years until the end of 2014, the exchange rate was fairly stable, allowing businesses to keep prices steady. However, this year the kyat has depreciated by 24pc versus the US dollar to K1278 yesterday, according to the official rate. At times, the fall has been swift – in July, for example, the kyat dropped 11pc.Myanmar’s currency, like many others in the region, will continue to be hurt by a strengthening US dollar. Domestic issues such as a widening current-account deficit and hold-ups in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will continue to put pressure on the currency. A flight to the US dollar over the election period and the threat of double-digit inflation will add to the kyat’s weakness.U Hla Phone Kyaw said he is also hedging risk by reducing the duration of credit to customers. In the past, he was able to provide credit for a month, but has recently limited this to just a week. “Now we have narrower margins and the risk is higher,” he said, adding that improved customer relations can also help keep the business alive.Other traders say the volatility has led them to stop selling altogether. Gold traders, for example, prefer to wait until the currency is stable before parting with their wares.The weakening kyat and the national flooding disaster have hit the electronics market hard, with the sale of luxury electronic items falling by up to 90pc, said distributors.U Myo Thein, owner of Myo Thein Electronics, said he has been unable to raise prices to keep up with the forex rate, because sales are already down by 20pc to 50pc.“We have not increased the price of items imported directly from China, Korea or Thailand, because they are not selling well,” he said. However, other companies selling goods in his shops have raised their prices.Importers now prefer to receive immediate cash payments from customers, and are offering incentives for upfront payments and discounts for larger orders. However, distributers are limiting purchases to items they are sure they will be able to sell.U Naing Toe, who imports Chinese fertilizer, said he never stores his goods to wait for a higher price.Traders have plenty of experience in managing exchange rate volatility. From 2010 to 2011 the kyat appreciated 20pc, spurring inflation. In recent history, traders have navigated hyper-inflation and demonitisation.However, the kyat has never reached K1300 to the US dollar, said U Hla Phone Kyaw. “The change is much bigger and the rate of change is fast. We didn’t need to think so hard about it in the past,” he said.Traders and distributers said that besides the currency problems, business in Mandalay has not been impacted by the new minimum wage of K3600 per hour, because most employees in the trade sector already receive at least this amount.However, the property and jade markets in Mandalay have been hurt by the slowdown in neighboring China, said traders.","/business/16333-mandalay-firms-fight-forex-their-own-way.html"
"236",236,"Informal cash flows threaten kyat policy",2015-09-02,"Business","An increase in informal cash flows poses a challenge to domestic monetary market stability, leaving the kyat exposed to movement in international currencies, say experts.           The capital accounts at domestic banks are controlled but there are a number of informal channels where foreign exchange flows can force the currency to move beyond the control of the Central Bank of Myanmar, said deputy governor U Set Aung.“Nobody can deny the volume of capital flows in the hundi market, though it’s hard to put a figure on it, as transactions are not processed through official channels,” he wrote in a journal published by the Ministry of Commerce.The hundi or informal remittance system is an exchange in which paying someone in one location allows a payment to be made by an agent in a distant location and the difference settled between the agents later on.The system was first developed in India to move money around the subcontinent. The word itself derives from a Sanskrit word meaning “bill of exchange”. In Myanmar it continues to fill the gaps that modern banks haven’t yet covered. Supporters of the system say it is convenient and cheap.The Central Bank of Myanmar allowed domestic banks to begin offering remittance services in 2012, but has struggled to formalise the sector.According to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, remittances from non-resident Myanmar citizens total around US$8 billion annually. Only 50 percent of these are processed through formal channels, according to official figures, though others estimate the percentage is much lower.U Set Aung said that due to a lack of monetary policy tools, the Central Bank has found it hard to protect the kyat against movements in other currencies. Domestic problems have also hurt the currency, he said. The kyat has fallen by 24pc this year against the US dollar, according to the official reference rate.“The domestic market has posed as much of a challenge as developments in the international market, yet everyone looks to the Central Bank to solve the problem,” he said.For example, recent rumors of a run on several major banks threatened economic stability, he said.In mid-August, after Thura U Shwe Mann was removed from his post as leader of the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) in a midnight coup, reports spread on social media that depositors were withdrawing funds from banks including AGD Bank, AYA Bank, CB Bank and KBZ.The Central Bank moved quickly to quash the rumours, announcing through state media that all banks were operating within the law.The monetary authority is trying to protect against weakness by practicing contractionary monetary policies, which are typically employed to slow an economy by reducing the supply of money in circulation.This is done through holding deposit and treasury securities auctions and raising the reserve requirements for banks, said U Set Aung.The Central Bank is also working hard to widen the cashless payment network by implementing mobile bank systems, e-commerce and other card payments, he added.The devaluation of the Chinese yuan has also weakened Myanmar’s currency, but the kyat is most vulnerable to movements in the greenback. Almost all trade payments are made in US dollars, even in border trade, where currencies such as the yuan and the Thai baht are converted.Trade across Myanmar’s porous borders accounts for another large portion of informal cash flows. Ministry of Commerce figures for border trade with Thailand are 90pc lower than official figures published by Thailand three years ago.U Soe Thein, former deputy director general of the Ministry of Finance, said the kyat is depreciating due to fundamentals, such as a growing budget deficit, inflation and a slowing economy, which are long-term structural issues.Myanmar’s trade deficit has risen quickly since fiscal year 2012, when the country recorded a surplus of $100 million. In financial year 2013, the deficit was $91 million, rising to $2.6 billion in 2014, according to statistics published by the Central Statistical Organisation.In 2015, the deficit jumped another 88pc to over $4.6 billion, according to The Global New Light of Myanmar. It is expected to widen further this year, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to the Ministry of Commerce, the income from five months of exports this year was $4.3 billion, compared to import costs of $6.3 billion.The trade deficit could be narrowed if remittances from abroad were formalised, said director U Win Myint. An increase in tourists would also help, or a rise in the international price of crude oil, he said.Year-on-year inflation this February was 7.45pc according to the most recent figures from the Central Statistical Organisation. The IMF said inflation had picked up to 8pc in May and is likely to rise further.The foreign currency reserves held by the Central Bank of Myanmar fell over the past few months, as it sold US dollars to the market, said U Soe Thein. The reserve bank has sold additional US dollars to local banks on condition that they on-sell 80pc of this to importers.US dollar income from remittances and foreign direct investment has not been enough to meet domestic demand, said U Soe Thein.“Even though informal remittance flows are large, they are unlikely to cover the US dollar transactional demand generated by the trade deficit,” he said.","/business/16267-informal-cash-flows-threaten-kyat-policy.html"
"237",237,"Can Myanmar benefit from China plan?",2015-07-13,"Opinion","China’s leaders are looking to convince us that their dreams of “one belt, one road” can lead to a new wave of global prosperity. These initiatives are designed to enmesh partners from near and far in a Chinese-led network of investment and economic growth.          The Silk Road Economic Belt runs straight out into Central Asia from China’s metropolises. With new train routes, roads and tunnels, it will offer the economic juggernaut better access to a sprawling Eurasian backyard and the lucrative European market beyond.The Maritime Silk Road will latch on to the Bay of Bengal – and therefore Myanmar – as it snakes its way right around to the Mediterranean. It is supposed to secure energy supply chains and access to new markets across southern Asia, the Middle East and Africa. It is an oversized plan meant to fill the appetites of the world’s most populous country.With all those growing bellies being fed, it will need to be a big belt and an enormous road — one that will encircle and possible entwine Myanmar, joining an estimated 2 million Chinese citizens and former citizens who already call the country home.Across Shan and Kachin states, and right down into central Myanmar, these ethnic Chinese enjoy a dominant commercial status. In certain corners of the country, in places like Mong La and Laiza, Chinese-language skills are essential for business.The fact is that Chinese investors bring technical and financial muscle that is rarely found on the Myanmar side of the border. The headline investments – like the off-shore oil and gas fields in Rakhine State, the postponed Myitsone hydroelectric dam in Kachin State and the contentious Letpadaung copper mine in Sagaing Region – tend to get the attention, but these are only the start.In construction, energy, manufacturing and services there are dozens of new Chinese players, some of whom have enjoyed unimaginable success back in China. Backed by the Chinese government, they want to seize the opportunities available next door. The brand-new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank promises to further change the equation in favour of Chinese companies.For its part, the Chinese government inevitably has firm ideas about how Myanmar fits into its bold plans for 21st-century economic development. It sees the country as a key site for large-scale Chinese projects, including the dams, bridges, roads and ports that will be the concrete-and-steel manifestation of the “one belt, one road” idea.How can Myanmar respond? Naturally, some key decision-makers in Nay Pyi Taw are reluctant to give the Chinese any more access to their markets and resources. Myanmar’s ongoing political transformation can be explained, in part, by a desire to create diverse international partnerships. The embrace of officials, businesspeople and academics from the Western democracies is caught up in this story.Yet there is no advantage for Myanmar in ignoring the Chinese plans or their global implications. The oil and gas pipelines that now dissect Myanmar territory have already re-configured the regional economic landscape. The oil pipeline was built to carry a maximum capacity of 440,000 barrels of oil a day, which is just shy of 5 percent of China’s daily consumption.For Myanmar, conversations with the Chinese should serve to support what will work best for locals. One priority is bolstering training and employment opportunities to improve the lives of working people. China has done this on a vast scale for its own citizens over the past generation. Its engineers, technicians and trades-people have proved the linchpins of an astonishing economic boom.Myanmar is well-positioned to capitalise on China’s next phase of growth but will need the commercial and political leadership to make sure that it gets a good deal. That deal can focus on the aspirations of the Myanmar people. They want stable jobs, good educational prospects and a healthy environment that supports the full diversity of cultural life.But understanding what China wants to achieve is a foundation for everything that follows. The fear in China is that to sustain its growth trajectory, and pull even more people out of poverty, it needs to rearrange its economic diplomacy and build new links across the world.This gives the Myanmar people the chance to build a relationship with China that takes the grand idea of “one belt, one road” and turns it into hundreds of bridges, training institutes, factories and communication hubs. It will be in those many investments that Myanmar can reap the benefits from the geopolitical reordering that is under way.During the coming years Myanmar will struggle to harmonise its needs with the wants of its giant neighbour. Ensuring that each investment maximises local returns will remain an ongoing challenge – a challenge that has proved arduous in some of the world’s most developed nations, including Australia, the United States and Canada.The balancing act of maintaining productive investment flows from China while protecting local interests will require a clear development strategy, robust institutions and high levels of transparency to ease public fears of losing control over Myanmar’s economic future.– New MandalaNicholas Farrelly is a partner at Glenloch Advisory and the director of the Australian National University’s Myanmar Research Centre.","/opinion/15460-can-myanmar-benefit-from-china-plan.html"
"238",238,"Unravelling the minimum wage",2015-07-10,"In Depth","A dozen young women sit on the curb outside a garment factory in Hlaing Tharyar township, holding brightly coloured umbrellas as shelter from the midday sun.          They are hoping to be allowed inside so they can apply for a job. Some already have work nearby, but they have heard the United Knitting Company is offering a relatively high rate for unskilled workers of K90,000 per month, and are hoping to switch.The standard monthly pay for a semi-skilled garment factory worker in Yangon is K95,000, including a base wage of roughly K40,000, a bonus of around the same value, an award and several payments made at the discretion of the factory owner, according to U Thet Hnin Aung, secretary of the Tai Yi Basic Labour Organisation and a member of the Myanmar Trade Unions Federation.“They usually pay the bonus, but there is no security. If we’re absent for one day, they can take some of these payments away,” he said.This is likely to change at the end of next month, when a national tripartite body will finalise details of Myanmar’s first minimum wage. On June 29, the National Minimum Wage Committee announced a provisional base wage of K3600 per day, and opened a two-month window for comment.Since then, factory workers and owners have fervently debated this figure, with owners saying they will pay no more than K2500 and workers saying they will agree to a minimum of K4000. Businesspeople from China and South Korea have threatened to shut their factories in Yangon if the K3600 wage is enacted, saying that costs are already high due to low productivity and poor infrastructure.For the workers, inflation and unstable commodity prices mean they may not be able to survive on less. On the current wage, many workers in Yangon are forced to live outside factory walls in structures built from bamboo and plastic sheeting. Some live beside large pools of stagnant water – breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes. Healthcare options are limited and expensive.Balancing the booksDespite the heated exchange of views, many say the impasse is not impossible to breach. A number of things could be done to improve living standards for workers and keep factory owners happy at the same time.The first is to renegotiate the overtime pay structure, said Jacob Clere, project manager at the Myanmar Garments Manufacturing Association (MGMA). According to Myanmar law, employers must pay double the basic hourly wage for overtime work. This compares to one-and-a-half times elsewhere in the region. Furthermore, a basic working week in Myanmar is 44 hours, compared with 48 in neighbouring countries.“Myanmar law presently requires the highest overtime wages in the region, meaning that a higher minimum wage has larger add-on effects if factories operate on overtime,” said Mr Clere. “Unless other changes are made, the proposed wage structure makes Myanmar uncompetitive with Vietnam and Bangladesh, as well as several other countries.”Additionally, some have suggested that factory owners could adhere to the minimum wage, but reduce or remove bonus payments.This “salary restructure” would leave workers with roughly the same wage as before – K72,000 for a 20-day month as a base wage, plus discretionary and overtime pay. Workers may feel cheated of their bonus, but it would also reduce opportunities for factory owners to use a “carrot and stick” method to ensure attendance, said the Myanmar representative of one international NGO.A compromise must be reached because many factories operating under the cut, make, pack (CMP) model genuinely cannot afford to pay their workers much more, said Daw Khine Khine Nwe, MGMA secretary general. Owners receive a fixed income, which averages at around 10 percent of raw material costs. Poor infrastructure means logistical costs are higher than in other countries, she said.As a result, the average locally owned garment factory is loss-making. “Salaries account for between 70pc and 80pc of total income, and other expenditures are around 50pc,” she said.Even before the introduction of the minimum wage, owners had been shuttering uncompetitive factories.“Last year many Korean and Chinese businesspeople closed their factories and ran away because they lost a lot of money,” Daw Khine Khine Nwe said.Boosting productivityMajor investment in training and infrastructure is necessary so that garment factories can stay open and provide safe, well-paid, long-term employment, according to workers, NGOs and factory owners.“In China productivity is three times higher than Myanmar and in Vietnam it’s twice as high,” said Daw Khine Khine Nwe. “It is hard for us to make the fixed delivery time, but we don’t have extra money and we cannot afford to provide compensation for the whole garment if it is delayed.”When US sanctions were imposed in 2003, factories in Myanmar closed and skilled workers moved abroad - mostly to Thailand and Malaysia. Although garment workers in Thailand are often not paid the daily minimum wage of 300 baht (about US$10), they can make more than in Myanmar, particularly in value-added industries. As a result, factories in Yangon are left with a stream of untrained workers and struggle to increase output, said Daw Khine Khine Nwe.On the other hand, workers argue that retention is low because owners are unwilling to provide training. “There are some training programs but they are very limited and the skilled workers leave as soon as they are skilled, because their pay is not increased,” said Daw Moe Wai, leader of the Tai Yi Basic Labour Organisation.Owners should realise the link between training and competitiveness, said Toshihiro Kudo, a researcher at the Tokyo-based National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies who has been studying Myanmar’s garment sector for the past decade. “An increase of productivity can offset the hike of wages, and the industry can keep its competitiveness in spite of the wage hike,” he said.However, this will require increased cooperation between the private sector and the government, he said.“In the short term, factories should set-up their own rigorous internal training programs,” said Mr Clere.In the longer term, MGMA has drafted a 10-year strategy and is working with international governments and agencies to improve the training infrastructure. “We are also working with the National Skill Standard Authority to issue competency certificates, which will help factories to determine suitable salaries,” said Daw Khine Khine Nwe.“But to do this, we need time. For the time being, we should accept [a minimum wage of] K2500. If in three months productivity is up, this can become K2800 or K3000. In six months it could become K4000 – it depends on how much we collaborate and work together,” she said.Infrastructure challengesThe other major barrier to competitiveness is Myanmar’s archaic infrastructure. The country is rated 145 out of 160 countries in the World Bank’s 2014 Logistics Performance Index – the lowest score in Asia.“We lack the infrastructure and logistics – our production lines are very expensive, they take time and time is money,” said U Myint Soe, chair of the MGMA and managing director of Chindwin Banner Company.“Everything is imported; the only things we can buy here are cotton balls and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bags, which are also made from imported materials. We don’t even have thread - this [reliance on imports] is dangerous for CMP.”Import costs rise when a domestic currency depreciates in value, and the kyat has fallen 9pc against the US dollar since the start of the year according to the Central Bank’s official rate and about 17pc based on the market rate. Inflation is also a concern, said Daw Khine Khine Nwe, and has edged up to around 8pc, according to the International Monetary Fund.“The fluctuation worries us. Workers are asking for a higher minimum wage – even though they know the owners cannot pay it – because of the rise in living costs. If we agree to pay and there is no control over rising costs, what will happen? Someone has to control this, but I don’t see any effort,” she said.Many believe that if the government is committed to supporting workers through a minimum wage, it could provide other incentives for international businesses to stay. “In Bangladesh some of the factories are able to move away from the CMP model, because of government support for the industry,” said Daw Khine Khine Nwe. “Here the government facilitates it verbally, but there is still a long way to go. Some of the ministries are willing to help but others take a hard line.”Lower taxes and an investigation into corruption could also help incentivise foreign workers to stay, according to commentators. According to an MGMA report published earlier this year, the garment sector could provide around 750,000 new jobs over the next decade, the majority for women, which account for 93pc of the workforce.“The government needs to do everything it can to support the garment sector as a major creator of jobs. But this shouldn’t be at the expense of decent work,” said Vicky Bowman from the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business.The main issue, according to Dominique Muller at the Clean Clothes Campaign, is the end price set by brands.“Clothing brands and companies should set concrete, measurable steps throughout their supply chain to ensure garment workers get paid a living wage,” she said. “If the industry lobby in Myanmar successfully pushes for the opposite it will prove extremely difficult for the Myanmar government to claim that it is making progress towards responsible investment and equitable economic growth.”For Daw Khine Khine Nwe, the situation “reminds me of a war-time movie”.“Four or five soldiers are trapped in a cellar. The enemy lets water into the room and the soldiers have no way out,” she said, adding, “I fear our industry could become like this. The costs are rising from beneath and the ceiling is fixed. We need to find a way to raise the ceiling and help the people.”","/in-depth/15431-unravelling-the-minimum-wage.html"
"239",239," Discover  a land of treasures in Mogok",2015-07-10,"","""More secret than Mecca and harder to access than Lhasa, there is, in the heart of the Burmese jungle, a small unknown city, whose fabulous resources have yet ruled over people for centuries: It is Mogok, the citadel of ruby.”          The mythical city of Mogok, 200 kilometres (126 miles) north of Mandalay, has excited many imaginations since French writer and traveller Joseph Kessel’s adventure novel Mogok, the Valley of Rubies was first published in 1955. It hit the headlines in May when the 25.59 carat ko-thwe (pigeon-blood) Sunrise ruby found in the area was sold for a world-record US$30.33 million at auction in Geneva, proving – if evidence were needed – that the market for precious stones is still booming.Today, a visit to Mogok guarantees a captivating experience in what is still a largely unexplored region of the country.The narrow twisting road that leads to the city snakes through densely forested hills and up into the clouds. Mogok’s scenic valley is surrounded by golden pagoda spires sat atop lush green peaks. The mist around the valley lends an air of mystery which is immediately striking to visitors. Jesuit missionary Giuseppe di Amato, the first European to live in the area from 1784 until he died, wrote, “It is surrounded by nine mountains. The soil is uneven and full of marshes, which form seventeen small lakes…It is this soil which is so rich in mineral treasures.”Mogok, whose rubies are exceptional in terms of both quantity and quality, is first the result of an extraordinary global geological process, in which the collision of tectonic plates liberated essential substances for the formation of rubies – notably chromium. But with temperate climates year-round, the twelve villages that make up the city – consisting of one-storey wooden houses and shops around a lake that was once a ruby mine – also make for a pleasant place to visit.The majority of Mogok’s population, which according to the 2014 census now totals around 166,000, is dependent on the ruby industry. For the miners, many of whom are descendents of Nepalese Gurkhas, life is tough. The hope of one day unearthing a giant gemstone – and the vast riches that come with it – keeps them going, though employment opportunities in the region are rapidly declining.“Miners earn about US$100 to $200 monthly on average, plus commission if they are lucky enough to find the finest gemstones,” said Jordan, a local miner whose father also worked on the mines. But with licensing fees, taxes and operational expenses – most notably the price of oil – increasing, salaries are being cut back, forcing many young people to leave Mogok in search of better jobs elsewhere.Every day, hordes of traders rush to the busy gem market in the middle of town. A closed world until recently, the market still operates the way it has done for centuries. The friendly women who come here to sell their wares – women, it is believed, are more patient than men for this job – proudly display their gemstones on small bronze plates or sheets of paper. It’s easy to marvel at the intense colors of the brilliant gemstones. The highest-quality gemstones don’t appear at the market, of course, but are sent directly to Bangkok or Hong Kong instead.Window-shoppers are advised to peruse judiciously: As soon as one shows interest in a gemstone, word quickly spreads between sellers. Sellers sit surrounded by calculating machines, scales and bundles of banknotes: Negotiations here proceed slowly, like a long game requiring patience, but always with a smile. Nearby, a street of old-style houses is home to a dozen family workshops where gem cutters and polishers are hard at work.Natural and unenhanced rubies, the national Myanmar gemstone, are among the rarest, and therefore most valuable, of all gemstones today. Stones are examined and certified by qualified gemologists, who use several criteria to determine value, including weight (1 carat equals 200 milligrams), brilliance (the amount of light that reflects back to the eye), cut, hue, transparency and tone.Some rubies can be worth more than diamonds. Certainly, their scarcity endows them with a greater market value. More than just a purchase, rubies are considered to be a sound financial investment, in the same way that gold and silver are. Reputable dealers and wholesalers, who mine or cut the stones themselves without using treatments, are the safest option.Rubies are not, however, the only gems that can be found in Mogok: Sapphires, spinels, peridots, lapis lazuli, moonstones, topaz and amethysts, to name just a few, complete the diversity of gems and semi-precious stones peppering the area – among the choicest stones in the world, with the exception of emeralds.The area has been mined by hand since the British colonial era. The British, knowing the interest of the French in Mogok and Upper Burma, feared that their ancestral rivals would take over the region and control access to China. Backed by a consortium of London-based gem merchants, they successfully planned an invasion of Burma with one of its main objectives being control of Mogok and its ruby mines. After three Anglo-Burmese wars (1824-1886), the Burma Ruby Mines Company, created in 1889 in London, was the exclusive operator in Mogok’s ruby industry for four decades until 1931. This fact partly explains the international notoriety of Mogok today. Yet the relationships between the British and the Burmese in Mogok reflected the colonial context of the time: The British notably forced the Burmese miners to wear heavy iron helmets to prevent them from stealing the gemstones by swallowing them.Myanmar’s military rulers in the past depended on the sale of precious stones to fund their regime. Gem trading centres were licensed to open with 15 percent tax paid to the government. The New Gemstone Law enacted in 1995 allowed local entrepreneurs to mine, produce, transport, and sell gemstones and manufactured jewellery in Myanmar and abroad, and since 2000, the government has undertaken joint ventures with private companies in the mining of gems on a profit sharing basis.Myanmar’s flourishing ruby industry today supplies over 80pc of world demand. India, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Greenland, Tajikistan, Madagascar and Tanzania are also known for their fine-quality rubies, though none of the mines in these countries have been able to rival the inimitable colour of Mogok’s rubies, which boast a fluorescent red shade, often with veins of light pink. And colour is king in the market: A change in international buyers’ taste toward coloured gemstones was reflected in the unprecedented high prices at major auction houses earlier this year. For this reason, Myanmar – known around the world as “Ruby Land”– is sure to continue being the most reliable resource of unequalled quality rubies in the world for many decades to come.Deposits of rubies in Mogok are said to be thinning today, and the number of fine quality stones, once abundant, is said to be declining. But the potential of the Mogok valley remains enormous, despite growing concerns about environmental impacts on the region. The greatest challenge in the coming years will be ensuring the people of Mogok are able to earn a living from the ruby industry in a sustainable way, as Chinese influence in the region becomes noticeably stronger.Getting therePreviously off-limits to foreigners, Mogok opened to tourism at the end of 2013. Visitors require a non-extendable permit from the government – which takes around three weeks to obtain (and can be refused for any arbitrary reason) – a licensed guide and an advance booking at a hotel to visit the area. Ananda Travel in Yangon can help with arranging travel to Mogok (www.anandatravel.com).Mogok is a scenic, five-to-seven-hour drive from Mandalay by bus or share-taxi.Where to stayThe charmless state-owned Mogok Hotel, built in the 1990s, is approved for foreigners. Located in the heart of the city near the lake, it offers basic double rooms for $40 per night.

The project is located on the Thanlyin River, near to the Chinese border, where ethnic armed groups are based.The government plans to build at least six major hydropower dams on the Thanlyin, also called the Salween, which flows from China into Myanmar, passing through the Shan, Kayin, Kayah and Mon states, into Thailand and the Andaman Sea.U Aye San, director general of the Department of Hydro Power Implementation, told The Myanmar Times on July 7 that “The project is still in process but is being delayed due to security issues.”A feasibility study and environmental and social impact assessment survey (ESIA) have been completed by third parties, and the project is now due to be submitted to the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC).“We will present details of the initial investment to the MIC. We have already estimated the total project costs,” said U Aye San.If it goes ahead, the completed Kunlong hydropower dam project would have an installed capacity of 1400 megawatts and Myanmar would have the right to buy 12 percent of generated electricity.Hanergy Holding Group and Gold Water Resources from China signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the project in 2007 with the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP), formerly known as Ministry of Electricity.The companies signed another memorandum of agreement in 2010 for work to begin. Asia World Group from Myanmar is also involved, through a partnership with Hanergy Holding Group.The feasibility study was carried out by Hydrochina Kunming Engineering. Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association (Banca) from Myanmar and Khiti Engineering Institute from China conducted ESIA surveys but they have not yet been made public.“According to the surveys, four villages in the area will be flooded if the dam is built. The villagers have agreed to move, and we paid K3.6 million to them last December for their rubber plantations,” said U Aye San.The Kunlong project is one of the largest hydropower projects in Myanmar to be developed through a joint venture with foreign and local companies. The government is planning at least 50 hydropower projects around the country through build-operate-transfer and joint venture agreements.The security in Kunlong area is unstable due to past clashes between the Tatmadaw and the armed wings of several ethnic armies.In 2010, government troops launched an offensive to seize control of the area but the Kokang army resisted, forming a Border Guard Force (BGF). Serious fighting broke out again between government troops and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) in February this year.","/business/15422-kunlong-hydro-project-delayed-over-security-concerns.html"

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe unveiled the pledge at a summit with his counterparts from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam – fast-growing economies through which the lower section of the Mekong river flows.“Japan will implement support worth around 750 billion yen [$6.1 billion] in official development assistance for the next three years,” Mr Abe told a news conference following the seventh annual Japan-Mekong summit.“The Mekong region, which has vast demand for infrastructure, is one of our most important areas,” Mr Abe said.“Japan will contribute to infrastructure development of the region in both quality and quantity,” he added. “The Mekong region and Japan are partners that will develop together.”It was not immediately clear if the pledge included previously earmarked Japanese financial assistance, or whether it was made up entirely of newly allocated funds.“The Mekong region is the most dynamic economic centre, but there still is room for huge growth,” Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha told the news conference.The meeting came as the leading Nikkei business daily said on July 3 that three Japanese companies had secured an order worth over 32 billion baht ($947 million) to equip a railway linking the Thai capital Bangkok with nearby suburbs.The Japanese government plans to offer loans to cover part of the cost, the newspaper said, a common sweetener that helps clients afford these kind of big-ticket projects.In a separate deal, Japan, Thailand and Myanmar signed an accord for a special economic zone (SEZ) in Dawei, southeastern Myanmar, local media said.The Bangkok Post reported yesterday that the three countries had signed a memorandum on tripartite cooperation in Tokyo.When completed, the zone on the Andaman Sea coast will have a total area of 200 square kilometres (80 square miles), making it one of the largest SEZs in Southeast Asia and a gateway for the Mekong region’s trade with India, the Middle East and Africa, Kyodo News said.Mr Abe has upped efforts to sell highways, train systems and power plants around the world, a key element in his bid to bolster the economy and Japan’s standing abroad.Beijing’s growing financial muscle, as well as its increasing willingness to throw its diplomatic weight around, have added urgency to Japan’s efforts to step up engagement in the battle for regional sway.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in November at a summit in Myanmar that Beijing’s strategic partnership with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping was entering a “diamond decade leading to broader and deeper cooperation”.Then in March, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China hoped to boost trade with ASEAN countries to $500 billion this year and $1 trillion in 2020.Beijing’s new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has also upped the stakes, rivalling the Tokyo-backed Asian Development Bank and offering the kind of financial firepower rapidly developing countries are keen to tap.In a bid to counter the Chinese move, Mr Abe in May announced a $110 billion investment plan for infrastructure projects in Asia, including in the “Mekong Five” states.Japan is keen to be seen as the benevolent giant in the region and has worked hard to burnish a reputation as the nation bold enough to push back against China in territorial and other disputes.Tokyo has its own spat with Beijing over islands in the East China Sea, but is increasingly vocal over China’s ambitions to control almost the whole of the South China Sea.Vietnam is one of a number of countries that have territorial disputes with Beijing over this busy shipping area.Siding with Tokyo and Hanoi, the participants jointly expressed “concerns” over the territorial disputes involving Beijing, saying in a statement that they “will further complicate the situation and erode trust and confidence and may undermine regional peace, security and stability”.But the meeting avoided touching upon other sensitive issues for the region, including a growing migrant crisis.Some 100 protesters from Myanmar and Japan staged a rally in light rain over Myanmar President Thein Sein’s presence at the summit, demanding that Yangon release all political prisoners.- AFP","/business/15360-japan-shores-up-influence-with-pledge.html"
"242",242,"The depreciating kyat-dollar exchange rate issue",2015-07-03,"Business","Myanmar has adopted a managed float exchange rate system. How does this system work? A useful way to find out is to look at how China has used such a system to fix the exchange rate of its currency the renminbi (RMB) against US currency the dollar ($). To illustrate, we begin by considering the US’s balance of trade with China as provided in the table below.          Table (1) shows the US buys (imports) goods and services from China more than it sells (exports) goods and services to China for 10 years from 2001 to 2010. That is, the US has had a balance of trade deficits with China for 10 years in a row. This affects the exchange rate  between the $ and RMB. There are two foreign exchange markets to show how this takes place. First is the exchange market for RMB in the US. And second is the exchange market for dollars in China.RMB exchange market in US is presented in Figure (1). For illustrative purpose, start with  demand and supply curves of D(r)0 and S(r)0 that give rise to exchange rate of $0 per RMB.Now consider what happens when US balance of trade deficits as shown in Table (1) comes into play. US consumers are now buying goods and services far in excess of what the US is selling to the consumers in China. Buying more Chinese goods and services implies an increase US demand for RMB. As a result, the demand curve of the US for RMB shifts upwards to D(r)1. With supply curve of RMB remaining the same at S(r)0 the RMB dollar exchange rate will appreciate to $1.US trade deficit with China will mean a trade surplus with US from China’s point of view. The  impact of China’s balance of trade surplus with US on the dollar exchange rate in the exchange market in China is presented in Figure (1a). Here again for illustrative purpose, we start with demand and supply curves D($)0 and S($)0 in the dollar exchange market, and the $/RMB ($ per RMB) exchange rate is R0. With such a balance of trade surplus the in-flow of dollars  exceed the outflows of dollars into China and supply curve for dollars increases and shifts to the right to S($)1. This in turn causes the $ per RMB exchange rate to decline to R1.To summarise the presentation up to now, two countries, USA and China, are engaging in trade. The US came to have a large balance of trade deficit in this engagement. The trade deficit will cause a rise in demand for RMB in the US and the $/RMB exchange rate will appreciate in that country. This appreciating RMB exchange rate will raise prices of imports from China and reduce these imports into the US as time passes.In the case of China, a trade surplus with the US will increase the supply of dollars in its economy, which leads the RMB/$ exchange rate to depreciate, makes American goods and services cheaper for Chinese consumers, and leads to higher demand and increasing US exports to China.The final outcome: as imports from China are reduced in the US and at the same time exports from US to China are increased, the trade imbalance between the two countries will narrow as time passes and ultimately disappear.But as we can see in Table (1), the trade imbalance did not narrow or disappear. On the contrary, the US balance of trade deficit with China continued for 10 years and the size of the deficit increased every year except in 2009 when there was a recession in the US. The  question is – WHY?The reason: the Central Bank of China did not allow a free float of its currency against the US dollar as mentioned in the paragraphs above. Instead, it prevented its currency from appreciating against the dollar, and also for the dollar to depreciate against the RMB. This is done by China’s Central Bank’s managed float action that involves buying billions of dollars worth of US treasury (government) bonds. As can be seen in Figure (1) such purchases by China floods the US with large inflows of RMB, causing the supply curve S(r)0 to rise to S(r)1. This results in the $/RMB exchange rate falling from $1 back to its original rate $0.Likewise, China’s Central Bank buying billions of US treasury bonds will lead to an increase in demand for dollars in the country’s dollar market. As shown in Figure (1a), demand curve for dollars will rise in China from D($)0 to D($)1. This increase in demand for dollars causes the RMB/$ exchange rate to rise back to the original R0.Resort to import of financial assets such as US treasury bonds plays the crucial role in the managed float of China’s currency exchange rate. On December 31, 2014, US treasury bonds held by foreigners amounted to $6.15 trillion. Of this China held $2.24 trillion, the largest amount which accounted for 36 percent of the total.Why did China from 2001 to 2010 engage in managed float and prevent the RMB to  appreciate with respect to the dollar? The simple answer: Maintaining high exports to the US is good for its economic performance and creating employment for its workers.Goods sold in the US market are produced in China by US multinationals. Multinationals gave  technology, know-how, enterprise, capital, management and marketing skills to China to make laptop computers, digital cameras, washing machines, out-sourcing services, etc, using cheap labour. These improved productivity, employment, incomes and living standards in China.  Purchasing US treasury bonds in fact amounts to giving loans to the US. Interest is earned on these bonds and risks are low as they are backed by the US government and the dollar is a relatively stable currency.Now, coming to the managed float exchange rate system in Myanmar, many reasons have been given for the present depreciation of the kyat-dollar exchange rate over the past months. Among them, one popular reason given is Myanmar’s rising balance of trade deficit. This can be seen in Table (2). The table shows Myanmar’s balance of trade deficit has increased substantially over the past three years, from $92 million in fiscal year 2012-13 to $2.6 billion in 2013-14 and to $4.1 billion in 2014-15.Since the kyat-dollar exchange rate depreciation has occurred over the past months, Table (3) presents the monthly balance of trade deficits from May 2014 to April 2015. There have been continuous deficits at the monthly level as well, except in August 2014, when a surplus of $84 million was recorded.Taking account of Myanmar’s balance of trade deficits with the rest of the world given in Tables (2) and (3) above, Figure (2) sets out the US dollar exchange market in Myanmar. For illustrative purpose, we start with D($)0 the demand curve for dollars, and S($)0 the supply curve which results in the exchange rate of K1000 per dollar. Now when Myanmar imports goods and services from abroad far greater than what it is exporting, the demand for dollars to buy these imports will increase in the dollar exchange market in Myanmar. Suppose demand curve increases to D($)1. Assume also that under a free float system the exchange rate will result in K1300 per dollar. But the authorities who are running the show in Myanmar had reservations with such a free float outcome. In latter half of June 2015, attempts were made to hold the exchange rate at K1105 per dollar (+/- 0.8pc). What is the reason for this?The reason may be provided by approaching the matter by means of a branch of study known as behavioural economics. Behavioural economics is defined as a study of psychological, cognitive, social and emotional factors ineconomic decision making of individuals and institutions.1To put it simply in looking at our situation, the authorities who are currently taking care of the exchange rate and monetary policy are also those who have been performing the same tasks  under the previous regime. Under the past regime, Myanmar was inward-looking, not in the  good books of major economic powers, was isolated, and under economic sanctions for many years. These had an impact on the behaviour and mindset of key economic policy-makers in the country at that time.Due to sanctions and other discriminatory acts, foreign exchange such as the dollar was scarce in those days and care has to be exercised in meeting three demands for its use. These are:(a) Transaction demand: to meet demand for dollars – to buy and sell in the world market;(b) Precautionary demand: to have dollars in store for security and to meet unexpected events and emergencies; and(c) Speculative demand: to have dollars to speculate in the foreign exchange, commodity, stock and financial markets.Among the three, priority has been given in the past to meet precautionary demand – to have sufficient foreign exchange reserves to take care of emergencies, man-made and natural disasters and huge economic disturbances coming from across the border due to regional and global financial crises. Similarly, as currency speculation has been a source of exchange rate instability in the country, cracking down on such activities has been a well-established measure that continues up to now, although with limited success.Hence, priority concerns of those in charge of foreign exchange management in present day Myanmar seem to be devoted to precautionary and speculative demands. Sufficient attention does not appear to be given to transaction demand, in order to ensure adequate foreign  exchange is allocated for the smooth functioning of the external trade sector.The need for the public sector to be more liberal with its foreign exchange earnings in support of the private sector is also highlighted by Table (4). It shows 57pc of the country’s receipts  from exports of goods and services are obtained by the public sector, while the expenditure for buying 83pc of imports of goods and services are met by the private sector.Figure (2) illustrates a managed float aimed at fixing the exchange rate at K1105 per dollar will result in a dollar shortfall amounting to ab. This shortfall will need to be further examined and analysed, and corrective measures properly thought out, planned and implemented. Some  ideas to undertake such a task are given below.First, administrative measures that instruct banks and financial community to abide by the managed float reference exchange rate set by the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM), and issuing warnings and threats of persecution if they fail to do so, is not a good idea. It will amount to going back to an old solution to resolve a new problem and will be looked upon as a major set-back to establish an exchange rate that is relatively stable, market-determined and meets ASEAN and international standards.Second, Myanmar is no longer isolated and doing its own thing without bothering with what is going on among its neighbours and in the rest of the world. The re-engagement with the outside world has far exceeded expectations and advantage should be taken of opportunities it has presented to us, in the reforms underway including the exchange rate issue.Third, it is not sufficient to look primarily at the balance of trade. Other items in our economic and financial relations with the outside world will need to be looked into in considering the exchange rate issue. These include inflows of dollars such as remittance from millions of our migrants working in foreign countries, net foreign investment inflows, foreign aid and loans, etc. Information on these should be made available in the current, financial and capital accounts of the balance of payments.Fourth, there are several types of exchange rates. What we have been concerned with is the nominal exchange rate. Another type which should be of interest is the real exchange rate  which is influenced by inflation in the country. Drawing attention to inflation leads us into the  need to take account of macroeconomic policy – fiscal and monetary – on the exchange rate.Fifth, keeping the exchange rate much below the market rate by administrative measures will  give incentive for people with foreign currency deposits in the domestic banks to withdraw their dollars and sell them on the free market to make handsome profits. This is not sustainable and a stage will be reached when just one bank runs out of dollars, cannot meet its obligations to its depositors, it could trigger a bank run, not only with respect to withdrawal of dollars but herd behaviour and withdrawal disease infects the kyat, and ending up with a serious banking  crisis.Sixth, there should be more reliable, timely and easily accessible statistics with respect to our trade and economic relations with the outside world to enable us to analyse and make recommendations on how to move forward on the exchange rate front.Seventh, with general elections just four months away, this is not a good time to have a banking crisis and our financial sector in turmoil. Instead, this is an opportune time for CBM to demonstrate that it is independent, it has clout, it is incharge, and is playing the lead role in dealing with the kyat-dollar exchange rate depreciation issue facing us today. It should not be standing on the sideline, allowing our managed float system being turned into a mis-managed float system, doing more harm than good. It should move away from being overly concerned with the precautionary and speculative demands for dollars and instead devote attention it  deserves to transaction demand to enable the private sector to play a more positive role in our international economic relations with the outside world. As noted earlier, the private sector  accounts for 43pc of the country’s export earnings, but takes care of 83pc of expenditures on our imports.Eighth, to show that CBM is taking charge, it should set its reference dollar exchange rate closer to the market rate, by allowing it to have access to the 57pc of export earnings of the public sector. Setting the reference rate say at K1200 per dollar may be a good start to achieve this objective.Finally, a few thoughts on how we might go forward with improving our foreign exchange management are given below:(a) First, the mandated independence of CBM must be nurtured and respected. This independence was won recently. As usual a newly independent entity faces a host of difficult problems. My hope is CBM will do a better job than what we did soon after our country got  independence in 1948.(b) Second, for CBM to be independent other powerful authorities should refrain, to the extent possible, from interfering in what are clearly falling within the area of competence and responsibility of CBM.(c) Third, CBM must exercise the independence to make decisions granted to it. It must implement measures and make decisions based on its assessment and analysis of critical issues in the banking and financial sector that require response and remedial action.(d) Fourth, CBM to perform this task, the person who is in charge – the Governor – must be willing and able to take on such a responsibility. Union Bank of Burma Act 1952, conferred upon CBM, the usual functions of a central bank. Hence, CBM has a long history. Over these years it has notable successes. It has also faced serious challenges. CBM’s governors and staff have learnt many lessons from this experience – the good and the bad, what to do and what to avoid. Hence, we still have in this country, dedicated banking and financial experts and their staff who can take on the challenges currently facing us, provided they are assured CBM will be an independent organisation and making decisions based on their knowledge and experience.(e) Fifth, as we all know after years of inaction and neglect, capacity of CBM like in other institutions in the country has fallen much below regional and international standards. CBM governor and his staff will need support. I propose support should come in the form of advisory team led by a foreign expert central banker to be attached to (or embedded in) the CBM to impart to our officials the knowledge and technical expertise to enable our central bank to play as an equal partner with other central banks in the region and beyond.(f ) Sixth, I believe the bilateral and multilateral donors will be ready to support such an initiative to meet the challenges facing CBM at present. But the initiative must come from us. The request for help and technical assistance must come from us.(g) Seventh, I believe our people in CBM has the capacity to prepare a request that gives well reasoned arguments and clearly indicates our commitment to cooperate closely with such an expert team not only to take care of the exchange rate problem but to enable the CBM to become a key institution for economic reforms in the country. Serious consideration should therefore be given to undertake such an initiative at present.(h) Eighth, why should we not give serious consideration to this initiative? Our neighbour Singapore at one time had a foreign central bank expert running the Monetary Authority of Singapore (central bank). The Bank of England, one of the great central banks in the world began operations in 1694. It had 120 governors from that date up to now. Among them 119 are British. The present one, the 120th appointed in 2013 is a Canadian. We are not mature enough to have a foreign central bank expert to serve as governor of CBM. So the second best solution I am suggesting is that we should appoint a Myanmar national who is dedicated and has technical and administrative capacity to run CBM. Perhaps we can count such individuals with our fingers, but they are there. This governor will be independently running the CBM and making decisions regarding crucial issues facing our banking and financial sector. In performing this task he will be assisted and take advice from a team led by an expert foreign central banker. Given our declared intent to reform the CBM, I do not believe this is too much to ask for.Note: U Myint is the President’s Chief Economic Advisor and Director, Tun Foundation Bank 1 Please see Sendhil Mullainnathan & Eldar Shafir, Scarcity the true cost of not having enough (Penguin Books: London, 2013).","/business/15347-the-depreciating-kyat-dollar-exchange-rate-issue.html"

According to some estimates, the company, known as Global Growth or Golden Global, may have defrauded its clients of nearly US$1.5 million.Though allegations of cheating have been widespread for some weeks, at this point only one client, who has requested anonymity, has complained to the police.Police in Kyauktada township, Yangon, have opened a case file under section 420 of the criminal code, dealing with fraud. They are seeking to interview the managing director and two other high-level officials of the company. They say the complainant lost about K20 million.A reporter from The Myanmar Times found the company’s opulent offices in Sakura Tower, downtown Yangon, closed yesterday. The company had been operating for about a year.“This case is about greed,” said a police officer at Kyauktada station, adding that there may be as many as 300 victims.“Most of them are waiting and watching to see how this develops. If our case succeeds, more victims may come forward,” he said.However, it is understood that about 50 former clients of the brokerage company wrote to the Bureau of Special Investigations – an economic crime-fighting taskforce – and the Ministry of Home Affairs on June 30, one of the signatories said yesterday. He added that he lost K15 million, and some of his colleagues lost K60 million.The letter makes allegations about the local partner, the managing director and other directors. “They offered jobs and investment opportunities to their employees and to customers,” he said.The persons sought by the police are both foreigners and Myanmar citizens.But a former customer told The Myanmar Times that there might be guilty parties other than those the police are seeking.In view of the scale of the losses, the police said the case could be handled by the BSI.The company charged clients a minimum $5000 deposit for investments in global commodity markets, say police.The company said it was a branch of Standard Bullion, a member company of the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society (CGSE). Customers were charged a $50 commission fee for each $1000 investment, according to a former customer.The local newspaper 7 Day Daily reported on June 14 that the brokerage company had allegedly defrauded its clients of $1.48 million.There are six or seven online futures exchange brokerage companies in Myanmar, most of which were established in mid-2014.Deputy Minister for Finance U Maung Maung Thein said last April that the government would warn these companies to cease operations, as futures trading was illegal in Myanmar. However, it is not clear what action, if any, the government took.The 2013 Securities Exchange Law stipulates that stock trading companies must receive permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission, or face a prison sentence of up to two years.","/national-news/yangon/15327-charges-loom-for-directors-of-futures-trading-firm.html"

Our original due diligence was based on the best information available at that time,” it said.A spokesperson from Coca-Cola confirmed to The Myanmar Times that Daw Shwe Cynn will remain a shareholder of Coca-Cola and that the US firm will facilitate direct engagement between non-government organization Global Witness and Daw Shwe Cynn. Neither Coca-Cola’s local partner Pinya Manufacturing nor its shareholders are Specially Designated Nationals as identified by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.Daw Shwe Cynn did not respond to an emailed request for comment yesterday.Coca-Cola confirmed that it carried out repeated and comprehensive due diligence based on the information available at the time before entering the Myanmar market in 2013. In addition, it reportedly conducted a search through independent firms on the reputation, background and trade sanction risks of the local partner and its shareholders and officers.In mid-2014, the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration briefly published information on registered company shareholders, including the identity number of each shareholder, before removing the information from the website several months later.This informed the Global Witness report, according to the Coca-Cola spokesperson. Global Witness did not respond to a request for comment by press time.“While the jade mining industry is unrelated to our business, we encouraged and facilitated engagement between Daw Shwe Cynn and Global Witness,” said the Coca-Cola report.“Our findings from the additional due diligence conducted in 2015 are in line with our earlier assessment and we remain confident that our investment is in compliance with applicable laws, and that our local business partners fully understand our expectations regarding human rights, workplace rights and ethical business conduct.”US lawmakers maintain a decade-old ban on imports of rubies and jade, as part of wider restrictions on activities or individuals that are believed to contribute to human rights abuses.Up to 90 percent of the world’s jadeite – the most sought-after type of jade – is mined in Hpakant in Kachin State, feeding a vast appetite for the green stone in Asia, particularly in China where it is believed to ward off evil spirits and bring better health. The famously murky jade trade has seen lower sales this year in part because of declining demand as the Chinese economy slows.","/business/15307-coca-cola-admits-link-to-local-jade-company.html"
"245",245,"A state of peace for Myanmar?",2015-06-29,"Opinion","When the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army declared a unilateral ceasefire earlier this month, the bloody war in Kokang faded from the headlines.          We can assume that all the attention focused on one corner of Shan State was getting inconvenient for the Kokang leadership, their Myanmar sparring partners and even the Chinese.This ceasefire is another reminder that Myanmar’s long-running borderlands conflicts are about so much more than public demands for ethnic autonomy.Wars fuelled by illicit trade – in drugs, guns, timber, gems and people – make it impossible to disentangle political demands from profit-making self-interest. And almost everywhere you look in Myanmar, for the past quarter-century, there has been a ceasefire, peace agreement or truce to further complicate local affairs.For an entire generation, the Tatmadaw leadership premised its efforts to guarantee the non-disintegration of the Union on these shadowy deals. Some have proved resilient, particularly where new wealth has lubricated the crunching frustration of ceasefire stalemates.Any long-term nationwide peace agreement will need to get to grips with exactly what has been going on.Perhaps the most successful ceasefire – in the sense that it has limited armed hostilities – is the agreement with the United Wa State Army. It has kept tens of thousands of guns quiet in one of the most difficult corners of Shan State. Yet it has also created conditions for a so-called “narco-army” to enrich itself, bulk up its defences and play an outsized role in the regional drug business.That business continues to boom, fuelled, in large part, by the cheap and unstoppable flow of methamphetamines produced in former battlefields across eastern and northern Myanmar.The fact that this lucrative trade thrives in the messy conditions of long-term ceasefires is no surprise. While under such circumstances Myanmar military, police and intelligence units are in regular contact with their counterparts from armed ethnic groups, it has been in nobody’s interests to push too hard against former adversaries, or to allow real scrutiny of what has been going on.With a wink and a nod, large parts of Myanmar have been surrendered to the pragmatics of ceasefire deal-making.Certainly in Thailand there are no illusions about the enmeshment of above-board business and illegal activities on the Myanmar side of the border. Some even claim that Yangon’s sky-high real estate prices are a direct outcome of this situation. Those who profit from the sale of illegal drugs have likely found that bricks-and-mortar and concrete-and-steel provide a safe investment.It is in this context that the peace-building efforts of the current Myanmar government have sought to find new compromises. There is still a large economic carrot being dangled for anybody who might be prepared to accept the government’s terms.Of course the hope is that over the years ahead the narcotics business – as well as other illicit activities like people smuggling, the wildlife trade, and black-market timber and gems – might become less appealing.One of the goals of the peace negotiations is to legitimise armed ethnic interests through economic and political incentives. The idea is that wealthier and more fully enfranchised people will have fewer reasons to rebel and can be discouraged from devoting their energies to illegal business.The Myanmar and foreign peace brokers who have been involved in these processes can tell long stories about what has been required to nudge discussions toward a positive outcome. The day-to-day grind of liaison, monitoring, negotiation, compromise and rebuttal is no joke.With such a traumatic history of internal conflict, the bottom line is that if Myanmar can get it right, the world will sit up and take notice. It will be a major turning point in the country’s political history and one of the most significant global peace-building achievements in recent memory.Yet that could all be undermined by the continuation of the old patterns, where ceasefires merely mark a pause in the eternal push-and-pull for influence, control and better positions.A further concern is that if the current government cannot finalise a deal in the next couple of months, we will be waiting until well after the election for peace negotiations to resume. In a best-case scenario, it could be at least six months after the poll before serious attention returns to the issue of peace building.Experience from the aftermath of the 2010 election also suggests that dangers can lurk in that period. It was after the last election that the Kachin Independence Army went back to war and that new skirmishes erupted in Kayin State.Given the tensions and sensitivities in 2015, there are serious risks that conflict could escalate yet again. One possible way to avoid that outcome would be to courageously agree the final terms of peace before the anticipated poll.Nicholas Farrelly is the director of the Australian National University’s Myanmar Research Centre and co-convenor of the “States of Peace in Asia” academic forum being held today at the University of Yangon.","/opinion/15242-a-state-of-peace-for-myanmar.html"
"246",246,"Nay Pyi Taw’s  hotel conundrum ",2015-06-26,"Business","After an extensive building binge, as the jubilation of hosting two major regional events subsides the government is seriously assessing how best to attract people to Nay Pyi Taw’s hotels. As the city’s 10-year anniversary approaches, it remains disconnected from the world. The question is becoming ever more critical – what next?            “There has to be a two-track approach to solving the Nay Pyi Taw problem and it’s a very, very big problem, let’s not kid ourselves,” said Magnus Bartlett, chair of Odyssey Publications, which is working with the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism (MoHT) on a campaign to promote the city as a destination for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE).“We’ve got to be visionary but at the same time we’ve got to have a fast-track short-term plan, if the government wants a capital city that is taken seriously around the world,” he said.Hotel construction has been one of the city’s major industries over the past few years. Local companies were asked to build accommodation at top speed in three specially designated hotel zones in preparation for the 2013 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games and the 2014 Asean chairship.As a result, the number of hotel rooms more than doubled, from 2111 in 33 hotels at the end of 2012 to more than 5000 rooms in 62 hotels as of mid-June, according to MoHT deputy director U Hlaing Oo.But due to the speed of construction – the government deadlines for completion were non-negotiable – many of the lower-grade hotels are shoddily built. Although no comprehensive data is available, average occupancy rates range from 43 percent at Kempinski Hotel to below 20pc elsewhere. To exacerbate the problem, almost 30 more hotels are under construction, according to MoHT sources.“Nay Pyi Taw is a very challenging market. Anybody who thinks differently is very naive. It’s a very tough place to do business. If you’re in for the short term you very much should consider being somewhere else,” said William Costley, vice president of operations for Southeast Asia at Hilton Worldwide, which opened a Nay Pyi Taw hotel in October last year.International operators in Nay Pyi Taw such as Accor, Hilton and Kempinski have not invested their own capital into the hotels and have less to lose from low occupancy rates. However, local owners, who invested equity in the projects, have lost out and will continue to do so. “Hotels in Nay Pyi Taw are not money well spent,” said Curtis S Chin, former US ambassador to the Asian Development Bank.Like the roads and ministry buildings in Nay Pyi Taw, many hotels were built by local conglomerates at the request of the government, in return for concessions that included vehicle import licences and land elsewhere in the country.Owners now use their properties to entertain ministers and businesspeople, as well as to host the occasional conference, according to expatriates in Nay Pyi Taw. Aside from this, many of the hotels are at times largely empty. But this shouldn’t be the case, said Franck Droin, general manager of the Kempinski Hotel Nay Pyi Taw.“We need to show people what there is here. If people haven’t seen something, they won’t know that they want it. Nay Pyi Taw is the centre of Myanmar and there are many places around here to visit. This city is perfect for the curious traveller,” he said. “It is interesting in this regard. It was built in secret. It has a park in the shape of Myanmar, a safari and a gems museum. It can be used as a base for day trips, as it is just a four-hour drive from Bagan and Mandalay.”Protected areas around Bagan and Inle Lake should not be overloaded with hotels, he said. “It’s important to consider the footprint and consider the options for sustainable tourism before it’s too late,” he said.However, others believe the dream of Nay Pyi Taw as a tourist destination is farfetched due to how the city is perceived overseas. “I created a two-day itinerary for Nay Pyi Taw, when I was a product manager for Tour Mandalay, and a US client said my proposal had discredited our company in their eyes. They said that this is not a destination for leisure tourists. I think nothing has really changed since then,” said hospitality and tourism manager Marek Lenarcik.While the government is considering promoting domestic tourism and has opened parliament to visitors, its primary focus is on developing Nay Pyi Taw as an international conference destination, through a campaign entitled “MICE is NICE”.Business tourism“Making this city a MICE destination is the right thing. It is the youngest capital in the world. It has sufficient facilities and infrastructure,” said Daw Khaing Mee Mee Htun, director of international and regional cooperation development at the MoHT.The ministry, in collaboration with several parties, is developing a website called Travel Nay Pyi Taw, which will include an events directory in 20 languages, and will allow companies to send enquiries directly to the hotels and conference centres. “I have been suggesting that we hold events like Formula One sports tournaments, tennis, golf and music concerts, as we have great stadiums here in Nay Pyi Taw,” said Steven Htut, who is building the website.The MoHT should work with five or six other ministries, including the Ministry of Transport, to realise the importance to the capital of a vibrant business travel industry, said Mr Bartlett.However, some are cautious about Nay Pyi Taw’s potential as a MICE destination, as they believe it will involve too much government intervention. Earlier this month, Sphere Conferences held a forum on hotels and tourism that was moved to Nay Pyi Taw at the request of the MoHT.“The Union minister this morning welcomed you all, but why are you here? Well actually because he intervened and said the conference should be here and not in Yangon,” said Mr Chin, during a speech. “If they want you to have a meeting here, you will, but this is not how business should happen. To me, Nay Pyi Taw is an example of a market driven by the government and not by business projections.”Even during the SEA Games, one of the two occasions in which hotels were supposedly fully booked, the Ministry of Sports bought all the rooms, according to a businessperson who attended the event. “No one could book rooms directly or choose which hotel they stayed in. It all had to go through the ministry, which allocated rooms. My hotel was 40pc empty,” he said.Another challenge to developing the city as a MICE destination is a lack of developed supply chains. Hotel chefs said that they have waited for months at a time for deliveries of tomatoes, cream, cheese and meat. Many bring their own supplies by car from Yangon.The head chef at a major hotel said that he has resorted to buying his own pigs. “We are out of cream and have been told it will come, but not for two months,” he said. The owner of a Yangon restaurant said he opened a Nay Pyi Taw branch but had to close it due to problems with obtaining regular supplies.A tough road to followTo begin to attract people to Nay Pyi Taw, the most important thing is to develop transport routes, said hotels and tourism minister U Htay Aung, during the conference last week.“We have to relax regulations. Nay Pyi Taw International Airport at the moment is just a name,” he said. “We need to incentivise airlines to come, [by removing] navigation fees and landing fees. We are very lucky to receive Bangkok Airways, but they are worried about return passengers. Also if it becomes easier to get here by bus or train that will be very helpful to get volumes. More people equals more positive feedback,” he said.Bangkok Airways operates the only international flight to Nay Pyi Taw, which runs five times a week from Thailand’s capital. Relatively few domestic airlines fly to Nay Pyi Taw – Serge Pun’s FMI Air Charter provides the most frequent service, but charges high rates of around US$320 for a return flight. APEX Airlines flies once a day and Asian Wings flies four times a week from Yangon.Expensive flights are a disincentive to hold events in Nay Pyi Taw, said a Yangon-based businessperson. “We hold our corporate events in Ngwe Saung [a beach in Myanmar’s Ayeyarwady Region]. I wouldn’t fly my whole team up here for $320 a head,” he said.Encouraging low-cost airlines to operate flights to Nay Pyi Taw is a challenge, said Mr Bartlett. “I talk to the airlines and they’re not interested in even considering coming here. They say, bring us the traffic and then we will come,” he said. Low cost carrier AirAsia stopped its service to Nay Pyi Taw due to low demand.As a result of so few flights, Asia World Company’s subsidiary Pioneer Aerodrome Services, which operates the airport, has not made a profit since it opened in 2011. Asia World repeatedly advised the government to abandon the project, even while it was being built, according to research firm Thura Swiss. Local media reports have said it has since asked the Department of Civil Aviation to take back the airport, to prevent the company from suffering severe financial losses.To reach the capital, tourists and businessmen have few other options. The train from Yangon takes 10 hours. The motorway connecting Nay Pyi Taw with Yangon and Mandalay is known as the ‘Death Highway’ due to the number of fatal accidents since it opened in 2009.The Ministry of Construction has called a tender to upgrade the road, and plans to police it better, but in the meantime the motorway continues to be shared by cattle, motorbikes, farm vehicles and the occasional pedestrian.Draining fundsEven if the transport systems and supply chains are improved, to attract visitors, Nay Pyi Taw needs a unique selling point, said Mr Bartlett.“The problem is that our corporate friends enjoy atmosphere,” added Thomas Kyaw Min Htin, executive committee member of the Myanmar Tourism Federation. “They say, hey, your city is like a resort, but we have nothing to do at night, no music, bar, nightlife. Of course there are shopping places, but not for foreign visitors,” he said.However, building new facilities and launching a marketing campaign will require yet more spending, said Mr Chin. “For Nay Pyi Taw to become a business or leisure tourist destination it will require significant investment, and the government has many projects more important than this,” he said.Even U Htay Aung expressed some doubt about the practicality of the MICE project. “Are we already committed to developing [the city] as a tourism destination? If yes, we can do everything, but there are many obstacles,” he said, during the conference in Nay Pyi Taw.Nay Pyi Taw has already been a huge burden on the country’s budget. Although the total cost is not public information ,estimates suggest it was built at a cost of US$4bn, and while much of this was shouldered by the private sector, the public sector budget also took a hit.“Instead of injecting revenues into programs that would benefit the country… the government squandered the money to build up Nay Pyi Taw, much of which is already crumbling,” wrote Shari Villarosa, chargé d’affaires for the US Embassy in Myanmar, according to a cable from 2007 leaked by Wikileaks.Today, the spending continues. In February, MP U Myat Nyarna Soe told the Amyotha Hluttaw that money invested in Nay Pyi Taw’s “giant road network” and other infrastructure was being wasted. “This aggressive development should stop,” he said, adding that it had also fuelled conflict over land.He said the low number of visitors to the capital showed that it was not a tourist destination, while industry was also unviable because it was too far from a major port. “Nay Pyi Taw is neither a commercial city nor a manufacturing [centre]. It’s just an administrative capital,” he said, as reported by The Myanmar Times.The annual budget for Nay Pyi Taw, directly controlled by the president, has been a matter of heated debate in parliament, as it remains much higher than budgets for the other states and regions.Lateral thinkingTo attract people to the city while avoiding another round of needless spending, the government needs to think differently, according to commentators, and consider how best to use the existing facilities. Once the projects under construction are complete, the city will have more than 90 hotels.“I have no idea why they didn’t design the SEA Games accommodation to be transformable into student housing and open a university there or a civil service training school once the need had passed, rather than force the construction of all these hotels by now-disgruntled construction companies,” said a Yangon-based businessperson.Mr Chin pointed out that in other countries, facilities built for large events are often rethought afterward. “In London, for example, affordable housing has been built on the Olympic Games site. But here, at the moment, there is no plan to turn Nay Pyi Taw’s hotels into anything other than hotels,” he said.Some at the conference said they believe that Nay Pyi Taw would make a good vocational training centre for young people. Daw Khaing Mee Mee Htun said that the MoHT was taking the lead on this, and that there is an idea to host students from around the country.Due to a lack of vocational training schools, the hotels currently train their own staff, many of which have never worked in the hotel industry before. “In the beginning the workers were not so interested, but now they are and they love to work – the passion has increased a lot,” said Tun Tun Naing, assistant manager at the Kempinski Hotel in Nay Pyi Taw.“The hotels are very good for developing people. There’s a fantastic attitude, but you can only grow as fast as you have talent,” said Mr Droin.However, others such as Mr Bartlett have even bigger visions for attracting people to the city. “To me it isn’t a hopeless case. We could turn this into the greatest campus city in the world. Why don’t we bring the universities here – Chinese, Indian, French, German, Australian. There’s the room and there’s the quality of life here,” he said.He also suggested developing Nay Pyi Taw as a centre for pan-Asian conflict resolution, or running an international competition for urban planners.“If we don’t do something very dramatic and different, I don’t think it’s ever going to work. But if that vision is there and the young people here can see that, then I think something very exciting could happen here,” he said.","/business/15228-nay-pyi-taw-s-hotel-conundrum.html"
"247",247,"Ministry talks target of 100% electrification by 2030",2015-06-19,"Business","Myanmar has one of the lowest rates of electrification in Southeast Asia, with about 30 percent of people drawing their lighting from electricity. Yet the country is well-endowed with the resources that are necessary to keep the lights on.           Transforming these resources from potential energy sources to powering the country will be tough work. The government has been developing an array of strategies and plans to get the sector going, with significant international help. It is not only generation that is due for an upgrade – transmission and distribution, off-grid energy, and areas like planning, financial sustainability and regulatory developments need to be worked on.The country’s resources are vast.There is the theoretical potential to generate 108,000 megawatts from hydro, estimated reserves of 711 million tonnes of coal, annual sustainable wood fuel yield of 19.12 million cubic tonnes, and theoretical wind power capacity of 365,100 terawatt hours (TWh) and solar power capacity of 51,973TWh. It also has proven oils reserves of 459 million barrels per day and 11.8 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves, both on and offshore.The Ministry of Electric Power is tasked with taking advantage of Myanmar’s possibilities to meet an ambitious goal – 100pc of the country’s population by 2030. It generates, transmits and distributes electric power.The Myanmar Times’ Aung Shin sat down with deputy minister U Maw Thar Htwe and the officials in charge of the ministry’s different divisions to discuss what needs to happen over the next 15 years to reach this target.First off, what is our current generation capacity?At present, we are generating from 39 power plants, including 25 hydropower stations, 13 gas-fired power plants and one coal plant. Total installed capacity is 4839.9 megawatts. It’s the lowest capacity rate [per capita] in Southeast Asia.Our daily generation capacity is around 43,500 kilowatt hours.What are the difficulties in developing the electricity sector to ensure Myanmar has enough power?The ageing transmission lines cannot load all electricity generated from power stations. We need to install transmission lines, but at the same time we are developing new generation plants. The key issues in electricity are capital investment and technology.Another major difficult is waiting a long time for public acceptance of implementing some major generating projects, such as hydro and coal.What are the ministry’s plans on addressing these difficulties? How are the electricity projects going?We have a number of plans and projects now being worked on. A key one is the Electricity Master Plan, drafting with the help of Japan International Cooperation Agency. The drafting is almost done.The master plans says to receive electrification rates of 100pc by 2030 we will need installed capacity of 23,594 megawatts. We have to focus on a mix of generation, including hydro, gas, coal and renewable energy, because we can’t rely on only one source for power.Coal and gas-fired generation will be the base-load generation as hydro and renewable are not available to generate the same load all the time.The objective of the master plan is to produce electricity based on a mix-generation system. The plan’s ambition is to distribute a stable supply at a reasonable price.So what will be the future mix of generation?Hydro currently accounts for 65pc of generation, gas power for 33pc and coal for 2pc in the present installed capacity of 4840MW. There is no renewable energy at the moment.By 2020, that will change. Hydro will be reduced to 54pc, gas and coal power to 22pc each, and renewable will account for 2pc of total capacity, which will be 8815MW.And in 2030, hydro will only be 38pc, while gas power will be 20pc, coal power at 33pc and renewable at 9pc. Total installed capacity will climb to 23,594MW.Here I would like to add more about renewable energy. Many people believe we can generate enough electricity from solar and wind, as our country is very hot and frequently windy. But this is not technically true.It is very important we have a controlled power system that has stable electricity for transmission and distribution. Otherwise we will never be able to solve problems of power cuts and line faults which come from having an unstable power supply. That’s why we are going to push coal and gas-fired power plants for stable power, supported by hydro and renewable power at the same time.No country in the world uses renewable energy for more than 10pc of their electricity generation.Can you share with us more about the National Electrification Plan, which is going to be implemented with a loan from the World Bank?The Ministry of Electric Power will spend US$310 million for expansion of transmission lines and another $90 million by the Ministry of Livestock, Fishery and Rural Development for rural electrification [off-grid power]. It is a soft loan with no interest, but we have to pay a service charge of 0.75pc over the 32-year repayment period.There are three steps to rural electrification in the plan. The first is electrification of the areas within 2 miles (3.2 kilometres) of the national grid. After that, this will be extended to 50km (31 miles), and in the third stage to create electricity access in areas far away from the national grid.What’s the annual state budget for the Ministry of Electric Power each year, and how is the ministry spending it?In the past, all electricity projects were budgeted by state. Today, there are three different methods, as the state cannot afford all projects. The first method is to implement projects using the state budget. The second is allowing domestic companies to build based on build, operate, transfer principles. Thirdly, we allow foreign investments as part of joint ventures with the government or local companies.So how many build, operate, transfer and joint venture projects are in the electricity sector at present?There are eight state-owned projects, six build, operate, transfer projects and 41 joint ventures. At this point, you might be surprised to know there are so many foreign investment projects, but there are many steps in implement joint ventures. Some of them are only in memorandum of understanding status. There have only between two joint ventures that have been allowed to be implemented on the ground. These two are Myitsone in Kachin State and Kunlon on the Salween [Thanlwin] River in Shan State. The others are still in the feasibility study stage.We are still hearing about Myitsone, which Chinese company CPI is trying to restart, and also about Kunlon, which is being opposed by local people and civil society groups. What is the latest status of these two major hydropower projects?As everybody knows, Myitsone was suspended by President U Thein Sein. We don’t know what will come with the next government.For Kunlon, we asked to developer to conduct an environmental and social impact assessment survey, as the feasibility study is complete. We asked for the environmental and social impact assessment before the project is implemented, because it is a big hydropower project that is 1400MW. These surveys are conducted by third parties.What are the environmental and social impact assessment standards for hydropower, and how are the surveys viewed?Environmental and social impact assessments must meet the standard of the Asian Development bank, and we use World Bank standards for coal power projects, but also welcome the Japan standard for coal projects. We have a number of experts and technicians in our ministry to view feasibility study reports. But the environmental and social impact assessments are viewed by the Department of Environmental Conservation.Also, for some big hydropower projects like Kunlon, we ask international institutions to review them.What are the impacts of opposition from public and civil society groups on hydropower and coal-fired power? What will the government’s solution be on these issues?We have asked companies to meet with the public to explain, until they understand or agree. So far we haven’t started any project, as there isn’t one where everyone agrees totally.What will the impact be? It is not certain our master plan will be successful by 2030 if we take so much time. It depends on people, and you, the media, which can shape whatever the understanding is, negative or positive, of any particular project.How can the government protect against possible negative impacts of hydro and coal power projects?First of all, you must be aware that there is technology which can solve some environmental impacts, for example from Japan. Secondly, people have to understand how we are applying international standard rules and regulations. If any power plant or project causes negative effects on the environment and society, we can shut them down.But how will businessmen dare to invest in projects worth millions of dollars if anything is unsure? People have to understand that.I’m curious about income from electricity sales after new the electricity price was approved, which started in April. What are the losses and gains from electricity subsidisation at the present price?We are still losing at present. In our country, electricity consumption comes mostly from low-income households. Around 56pc of consumers are using electricity in households at prices of K35 per kilowatt hour. Meanwhile, the cost of generation is from K35 to K70 for hydropower and K120 to K130 for gas. On average, around 75pc [of the ministry’s customers] use K100 per kilowatt hour, and only 25pc is industry, which uses a higher price.So the income does not cover all the costs of generation, transmission and distribution, and one more thing is power loss. Another reason there is less income being earned is because of the lessening ratio of hydropower, even though production costs are low.Electricity prices have increased by 40 to 50pc [in the last year]. How much profit or loss is the ministry making at present?At the end of the last financial year, profits were K3 to K4 per kilowatt hour. But if we include our capital expenditures, we can’t say we are making a profit.Subsidisation of current electricity distribution is likely to continue at current prices. For the longer term, we [the government] can’t stand without profit.When do you expect to increase the electricity price to reduce subsidisation?It depends on the consumers, on when people can pay higher prices and parliament can understand that. Without parliament’s agreement, we can’t change the price.It is likely to happen once every two years, if everyone agrees.For the time being, subsidisation of electricity distribution will continue for longer.","/business/15110-ministry-talks-target-of-100-electrification-by-2030.html"
"248",248,"Customers irate at futures trading firm",2015-06-18,"Property News","Unlicensed futures brokers have been accused of cheating large sums of money from clients who fear they will never be able to claim the money back because the companies are operating illegally.           A company which goes by two names – Global Growth and Golden Global – has allegedly cheated US$1.48 million (K1.65 billion) from customers, according to local newspaper 7day Daily. The company reportedly tells clients that it is a branch of Standard Bullion, which is a member of the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society.The company is based in one of Yangon’s most expensive office buildings, the Sakura Tower. It has opened two separate offices on different floors, and put up signs to say that it is an authorised money changer.However, it has allegedly been running a futures exchange broking business, allowing Myanmar clients to invest in countries such as New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Indonesia. Futures trading is mostly conducted in contracts for commodities such as gold, oil and gas, and timber, as well as foreign currencies.There are at least six or seven unlicensed futures brokers operating in Myanmar, according to an investigation by The Myanmar Times in April, most of which were established last year. Customers are required to pay a deposit of between US$500 and $10,000 to open an account, and must pay commission fees on investments.However, many of the customers of Global Growth and Golden Global have been unable to claim their deposits back. “I didn’t lose too much, but some of my friends will lose about K100 million,” a former client of the company told The Myanmar Times.A Myanmar company official told her that the problem was due to illiquidity and will be solved soon, but she no longer trusts the company. She also said that she is unsure whether the investment was legal, as the company is unlicensed and she possesses no legal receipt of her payment. “I knew the company was illegal, but I did not take it seriously,” she said.Other clients are equally confused about the legal path they should take. “It is too early for suing. We have to wait. And legal action is expensive,” a former customer said.Company officials and staff refused to answer questions about their business. “We can’t explain anything yet. And we can’t meet with journalists yet,” said a member of staff to Myanmar Times reporters at the office on June 15. Following this, a company official called security and ushered out reporters. Futures broking is illegal in Myanmar, but the number of companies offering the service is on the rise. Some of the newcomers are reportedly educating prospective customers about their business models in the offices of the largest business federation in the country – the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI).In the prohibition and punishment chapter of the Securities Exchange Law, section 22 states that no one may operate a business of a stock exchange without permission from the Security Exchange Commission Myanmar, which is chaired by U Maung Maung Thein, who is also the deputy minister of finance.Until now, the government has taken no action against the companies, despite the fact that newspapers have been reporting on illegal future brokerage businesses since May. However, U Maung Maung Thein may meet with journalists soon, his personal assistant said on June 15.In April, he told The Myanmar Times that the government would serve serious warning notices to the brokerage companies personally. If they did not then stop their business then the government would instruct police to launch criminal investigations and prosecute them, he said.","/business/property-news/15091-customers-irate-at-futures-trading-firm.html"
"249",249,"Parliament votes to join and contribute to Asian bank",2015-06-11,"Business","Parliament has overwhelmingly voted to sign up with the Beijing-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, agreeing to contribute US$264.5 million over 10 years.           Myanmar is one of 57 prospective members for the bank, which is slated to play a similar role to other development institutions such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. Yesterday, Pyidaungsu Hluttaw parliamentarians voted on the June 9 proposal to join, with 454 in favour, 7 against and 3 abstentions.The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has drawn criticism it may be under too much control from China, though local officials say it provides an additional possible source of funding.Finance minister U Win Shein said Myanmar’s low development status means it will only have to contribute 20 percent of $264.5 million, or $52.9 million, in 10 installments over the first 10 years.The calculations for fees to join were based on GDP and consumption, he added. The bank is to launch with $100 billion in capital, and Myanmar’s $264.5 million contribution is to give the country 2645 votes.The proposal in the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw to join the institution came from U Win Shein on June 9, and was seconded by U Kan Zaw, minister for national planning and economic development, and U Kyaw Kyaw Maung, governor of the Central Bank of Myanmar.Some parliamentarians said they wished more time was spent considering the proposal.U Win Oo, a representative from Yephyu township, told The Myanmar Times there were only two good points from providing initial capital, “that Myanmar can vote and that it can get more loans. But we need to think on what percent of profit Myanmar can get from joining the infrastructure bank.”U Win Oo added he did not object to working with the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which is supported by China, adding it may reduce reliance on the United States-supported World Bank.The United States and Japan have been the two most prominent countries not to join the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank.Meanwhile, China will ultimately have “veto power” over major decisions of the new Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Wall Street Journal reported on June 9.The Wall Street Journal quoted people close to the bank as saying its voting structure will give China the “upper hand” as the largest shareholder, effectively granting it veto power.According to the bank’s articles of incorporation, China is providing nearly $30 billion of the institution’s $100 billion capital base, giving Beijing between 25 to 30 percent of total votes, it said.The bank’s lean structure will be overseen by an unpaid, non-resident board of directors, the newspaper said.The bank, which is expected to be operational later this year, has been viewed by some as a rival to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.But there are concerns over transparency of the lender, which will fund infrastructure in Asia, as well as worries that Beijing will use it to push its own geopolitical and economic interests as a rising power.Last week former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke rebuked US lawmakers for allowing China to steal a march with the new bank, which threatens to upend Washington’s oversight of the world economic order.He said lawmakers were to blame because they refused to agree 2010 reforms that would have given greater clout to China and other emerging powers in the International Monetary Fund.Under President Xi Jinping, China is pushing to build on the ancient Silk Road trade routes on land and sea, through its “One Belt, One Road” initiative expected to be partly funded by the AIIB.But supporters say fears over undue Chinese influence are overblown, and that the participation by more than 50 countries, including ones as diverse as Britain and Iran, will dilute Beijing’s power.The United States led a high-profile, and ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to dissuade allies from taking part in the bank. Translation by Thiri Min Htun,Additional reporting by AFP","/business/14982-parliament-votes-to-join-and-contribute-to-asian-bank.html"

After decades of keeping a relatively low profile, the country has become more assertive with its international interactions. It is now pushing two plans that could have a large impact on its neighbours, turning to the past for inspiration.The Silk Road Economic Belt is a China-led initiative to better connect the region, stretching west along the path of the old China to Europe trade route.Officials subsequently announced the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, a ocean-based route counterpart to the Belt.“The plan is expected to change the world political and economic landscape through development of countries along the routes, most of which are eager for fresh growth,” state news agency Xinhua has said.The plans have been closely associated with China president Xi Jinping, and references to it have generally been in the context of increase infrastructure development through the region.In March, according to a Wall Street Journal China Real Time report, Chinese officials fleshed out some of the details. Financing is to come from a variety of sources, including the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a government-backed US$40 billion Silk Road Fund, and a New Development Bank set up by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The report said plans don’t just call for roads, rails and ports, but also for development of oil and gas pipelines, fiber networks, IT, new energy, and biotech.High-level diplomatic visits by Chinese leaders have been frequent in the region, and they have gained significant backing for their initiatives. Its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank for instance has 57 prospective founding members, including Myanmar and also usual US allies like Australia and the United Kingdom – though the United States and Japan remain the two most prominent countries to sit it out.Along with these high-level pushes, China is also working to build better connections with regional non-government organisastions. State-funded China NGO Network for International Exchanges is part of the push, working to develop institutional platforms for exchange and cooperation between China’s NGO and their ASEAN counterparts.Chinese NGOs are restricted, and some commentators say the planned introduction of an NGO law this year may introduce further restrictions.Beijing, though, is keen to cement ties with its state-sponsored NGOs and their ASEAN counterparts. It held the second China-Southeast Asia High-Level People-to-People Dialogue in Bali, Indonesia last week. The Myanmar Times was one of the participants sponsored to attend.Yet journeying to the conference laid open the challenges of the Belt and Road.Flying to Bali from Yangon usually entails a Southeast Asia stop in a city such as Singapore or Kuala Lumpur, but Chinese organisers were keen to showcase the improving transportation links.Yet Guangzhou, the scheduled transit airport, was closed due to weather, and the plane had to continue to the Haikou Meilan airport on Hainan Island. The situation greeting arrivals on Hainan Island bordered on the farcical.Non-Chinese getting off the plane were allowed only a few steps into the airport. Chinese immigration officials greeting the arrivals did not speak English, though they kept asking each non-Chinese passenger the same questions in Chinese, which none of the remaining passengers spoke.The ancient Silk Road was not only a link of roads and trails, but also people. The mixing of different cultures produced a degree of understanding and mutual respect; clearly, there is some way to go on this front for the Silk Road’s modern counterpart.Passengers were finally given temporary visas allowing them past the immigration counter, just in time to turn around and board another plane, to Guangzhou and then Kuala Lumpur, a more usual city for transit between Yangon and Bali. What was novel about the journey was the imperative to transit in China’s Hainan Island.In the end, The Myanmar Times missed most of the soft diplomacy on display. China’s vice president Liu Yangong was in attendance, as were numerous other Chinese and ASEAN delegates from NGOs, business and media.Reporters were in time to attend discussions on ‘Towards People’s Consensous on Community of Common Destiny” and “Towards People’s Actions for Win-win Cooperation”. A declaration pledging closer cooperation was duly announced.China NGO Network for International Exchanges, the ASEAN Foundation and the Indonesian Academy of Science announced plans to form a permanent organising committee for future dialogues.The committee aims to strengthen ties between the roughly 60 countries that are to be included in the Belt and Road initiatives.China NGO Network for International Exchanges secretary general You Jianhua said all of ASEAN is on board with the Belt and Road initiative.“We are going to organise more people-to-people meetings to undertake concrete actions leveraging non-governmental actors,” he said.Yet not everybody appeared to be on the same page. ASEAN is one of the world’s most diverse regions, with some countries such as Philippines and Vietnam in confrontation over ownership of islands in the South China Sea.“The rise of China as a super power, its influence in the region, and the South China Sea conflict are key issues that we can’t avoid,” said one speaker from Philippines during a panel session.“How will China make sure or promote peace and security in the region to ahead with its Belt and Road program?”The event finished with an overwhelming chorus of Chinese cultural songs, accompanied by dances and performances.The flight back was mercifully less of a headache than the trip to Bali. This time the transit point was Hong Kong – while more out of the way than Singapore or Kuala Lumpur, at least its customs officials are friendlier than Hainan Island. It also ended four days of travel for one day at the event.As much as the hosts were eager to please, it was clear they were also interested in the views of delegates.Over dinner at the conference, amid the Chinese dance displays, singers and general pageantry, a senior Chinese official asked what The Myanmar Times thought about the twin Belt and Road initiative. I said I wondered, with all the Chinese involvement, whether there would be room for any from Southeast Asia.","/business/14983-long-journey-for-china-s-belt-and-road.html"
"251",251,"CPI pushes for restart of Myitsone Dam",2015-06-05,"Business","President U Thein Sein has suspended the Myitsone Dam project until the end of his current term. Once this is over, CPI Yunnan International Power Investment Company (CPIYN) says it is hoping to restart work.           The president temporarily halted the hydropower project in Kachin State in September 2011, about six months after taking office. The Myitsone Dam faced significant criticism over its environmental impact and its affect on local residents, which U Thein Sein alluded to when ordering the suspension.Some local villagers say they oppose the project, but CPIYN officials say they are preparing for a possible restart once the president’s term is over after this year’s election.CPYIN says they were not given the opportunity to explain the dam’s upside before the 2011 suspension, and are now casting a wide net in explaining its benefits, talking to a range of organisations. It has also hired British public relations agency Bell Pottinger to help convince stakeholders that the dam is the best way to provide Myanmar with power and that it will do more good than harm.“We are in communication with lots of the stakeholders – NGOs [non-government organisations], the government, the NLD [National League for Democracy], the 88 Generation student group and the ethnic groups. They are human and they know that Myanmar needs electricity. Ultimately it will be a government decision whether or not to restart it, but the discussions are an ongoing process,” said Mr Wang Ping, chief of the department of public affairs at CPIYN.“We are not clear on whether the suspension will be lifted at the end of U Thein Sein’s term, but we firmly believe that the benefits will be appreciated.”London headquartered reputation management company Bell Pottinger confirmed that it is working with CPI. It has also hired former UK ambassador to Myanmar, Mark Canning, as a senior consultant for the region, though he is not directly managing the CPI account. Separately, Mr Wang said that also negotiating on CPI’s behalf are members of the Myanmar China Electric Power Committee, a government to government mechanism established last year.Villagers also believe the project could soon be resumed. On May 24, Myitkyina township administrators visited Aung Myin Tha new village to try to force residents to sign an agreement saying they have no right to use vacant property, and could be dispossessed in the event that the project is restarted. However, residents refused to sign the agreement, according to the villagers.Residents from Tan Hpre village told The Myanmar Times that they are worried the project will start again and they accused the government of wanting the destroy the Ayeyarwady River. “I think the project will be resumed after 2015. Myanmar people need to protect this river and the new government should suspend or abolish this project completely,” said U Tu Hkwan from Tan Hpre village.Whether or not the project is restarted depends on the policy of the new government. A member of the Kachin National Democracy Congress Party said the party will object again if the next government resumes the project.“We don't want this dam project. I don't understand why CPI doesn't look out for the environment and the future of the Ayeyarwady river. They should. And the next government should respect what the people want,” he said.Relocating the localsMr Wang believes that the company has not been given a sufficient chance to explain the benefits of the project. CPI signed the deal for the dam projects with the former administration. According to separate sources, one of the conditions of the contract was that the Chinese company did not undertake any promotional activities to convince villagers of the benefits of the dam.“In the old Myanmar, you couldn’t talk freely and everything was done on a government to government basis. You couldn’t check with families about their wishes, or whether they were willing to relocate. We didn’t have enough time to explain to the villagers what the project is about,” said Mr Wang.“Then the government changed. There was no dialogue before the project was halted. The president himself had come to inspect our progress and he approved it,” he said.To date, 2146 people from five villages have been relocated to two resettlement sites, he said. To facilitate the entire project, which includes six other large dams in addition to Myitsone, 18,000 people will need to be relocated from 53 villages – 11,000 of these will be moved from the Myitsone area.“This might sound like a lot, but it is very little compared to the Three Gorges Dam in China where 1.15 million people were relocated,” said Mr Wang.Since the project was suspended, several of the relocated villagers have returned to their old homes to work on the farms and some have opened restaurants and general stores. “I sell snacks, coffee, noodles and grilled fish near the Myitsone resting camp, it’s good for us. If we live in the new village, we can’t get money,” said Daw Hkawn Nam, who has opened a restaurant.U Aung Hpan, the administrator from Aung Myin Tha village said the authorities know that the villagers don’t want to live in the new village, but they are not allowed to return to their old homes, as the dam project may be resumed after president U Thein Sein’s term.Old controversiesObjections to the project are many and varied. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi wrote an appeal against it in 2011, which cited a lack of sound planning, the failure to enforce necessary conservation laws and a poor ecological awareness. The area is widely recognised for its biodiversity.While the appeal accepted the benefits that hydropower dams can bring, it also noted that the environmental impact assessment (EIA) report, published in 2011, “has generated intense concern, in particular with regard to the safety aspect”, due to the dams’ proximity to fault lines.Others such as the Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association (BANCA) claimed the EIA was rushed, and that CPI did not wait for its completion before starting construction and resettlement. The location of the dam was also contested, as the reservoir will submerge important historical and cultural sites, as well as the area recognised as the birthplace of Myanmar.“There is fear that the area to be flooded is the size of Singapore. Singapore is a very small place. Also, most of the area is mountainous, with gorges, and it’s very remote with not many people living there,” said Mr Wang. “Many say that the social and environmental impact of the project is too big, but according to our EIA, it is acceptable and can be mitigated. The environment is always in our heart,” he added.Many are also concerned that 90 percent of the electricity will be exported to China, but Mr Wang was keen to correct this. “Myanmar will get 10pc for free, which is more than 10 billion KwH per year [from the total seven proposed Ayeyarwady hydropower projects], and then it will be able to draw down as much as it needs at a negotiated price. The remaining power will be sold to anyone who wants to buy it, whether it’s China or other countries. We must be clear that the electricity will first be used to meet nationwide domestic demand and that the first 10pc will be free,” he said.China does not need additional power from Myanmar, he added, and this year there is a 7000-megawatt (MW) surplus in Yunnan province alone. However, civil society groups including the Renewable Energy Association of Myanmar have pointed out that most of Myanmar’s population lives off-grid and therefore will not benefit from the dam.“We could offer assistance in this. China is ready to help – many parties are ready to help, but Chinese companies are the most suitable in terms of price, quality and delivery,” said Mr Wang. He added that as the grid is expanded in Myanmar, more people could benefit from power generated by a dam at Myitsone.Another major concern is that conflict between ethnic Kachin and the military was reportedly exacerbated in 2010 after work began on the Myitsone project. Fighting between the Kachin Independence Army and the Tatmadaw broke out in June 2011, ending a 17-year ceasefire. Three months later U Thein Sein suspended work on the dam.“There are now important plans for peace deals, and if they are passed, that will make a big difference. We are praying for a permanent nationwide ceasefire,” said Mr Wang. “We are hoping that our project will be part of the solution to the conflict, as it will lead to more local jobs, better infrastructure and better communications.”Mr Wang said that CPI will need to be sure there is no more fighting before it resumes work. “Without permanent peace, nobody will be willing to invest.” However, he conceded that it is possible the project could go ahead without a ceasefire deal, if the government agrees to it.Working out a benefit-sharing scheme between the government and ethnic groups for the profits of the project is not the responsibility of CPI, said Mr Wang, and must be negotiated by the parties themselves.A need for powerMyanmar’s need for power is well documented. The government has several options, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), oil, coal, hydropower, wind and solar. The World Bank believes that hydropower is one of the best solutions for powering Myanmar. In January, it held a workshop in Nay Pyi Taw on sustainable hydropower.The International Finance Corporation which is the private sector financing arm of the World Bank, plans to work with the Ministry of Electrical Power and the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry to rank all of the possible hydropower projects in Myanmar in terms of environmental impact and productivity, with a view to identifying the best sites for development. The project is due to begin later this year.Myanmar is among the world’s biggest untapped territories for hydropower, according to the International Hydropower Association, having only made use of 2.6 gigawatt of over 100 GW of potential. Total installed capacity in Myanmar is 3300MW, three-quarters of which is hydropower, from 19 operating projects. Myanmar aims to provide electricity to 50 percent of the population by 2015, and 100pc by 2030.In light of this, CPI has no plans to abandon the Myitsone project. “The country needs electricity, that’s why we choose to stay. We are not frustrated, as we are not here to make a quick buck. It’s a long-term project, so it needs a long-term mindset and that’s what we have. We are committed,” said Mr Wang.Hydropower is much cheaper than many of the other options – LNG costs K150 to K170 per unit, coal costs K70 to K80 per unit and hydropower is K60 to K70, according to Mr Wang.“It’s very competitive. Coal is not suitable as there is no coal in Myanmar of adequate quality so it would need to be imported. Gas is too expensive – the government will be paying four to five times the current bill if they choose LNG. Solar power is not steady, and nor is wind, they are suitable as a back-up but not as a primary power source,” he said.Furthermore, if the government chooses to use the country’s hydropower, it will receive a large amount of income. For the total seven upstream Ayeyarwady projects, the government would receive $54 billion throughout the 50-year concession period. It would receive $18 billion alone from Myitsone, and have full control of the dam once the concession period is over.Whatever the decision, it needs to be made soon, said Mr Wang. “If we started the project tomorrow it would take nine years before it was producing power. If you want my hydropower by 2030, you need to make a decision now. There are businesses complaining that there isn’t enough electricity.”StalemateOthers note that the Myitsone project itself is also under time pressure – after a certain point it will no longer be economically viable. Investors have already spent US$1.2 billion and money is being spent every day on maintaining the sites and providing free 24-hour power to the surrounding villages. In total the Myitsone dam alone is likely to cost $8 billion to complete.China has stated that if Myanmar wants to cancel the project completely, it will need to solve the situation legally and provide compensation for the contract. “CPI will require at least $5 billion in compensation for the time and money spent,” said a source close to the project. “If the project is cancelled altogether, they will almost certainly sue the government.”On the other hand, if the project was to be restarted, investors would need a guarantee that the project would not be suspended again, said Mr Wang. “What’s to say it won’t be stopped again? If it is restarted there will need to be assurance – to get the financing to continue the project we will need to meet certain requirements,” he said. “The new government will have to handle its existing contracts very carefully. The spirit of a contract is very important.”Furthermore, it is important that the villagers receive communication about whether or not the project will be restarted. The government has not made it clear whether they will be expected to stay in their new accommodation or be allowed to move back to their ancestral villages, according to Mr Wang. In the meantime, CPI will continue to offer assistance to the villagers, including through rice donations, he said.What is the Myitsone Dam?The Myitsone Hydroelectric Project is situated at the confluence of the Malikha and Maykha rivers. It is the southernmost and largest of seven dams planned to be built along the Ayeyarwady, Malikha and Maykha rivers. If built, it will become one of the largest hydropower stations in the world, with an installed capacity of 6000 MW.CPIYN is the majority shareholder in the Upstream Ayeyarwady Confluence Basin Hydropower Company (ACHC), which was registered in 2010 and is a joint venture between the Ministry of Electric Power (15 percent), CPI (80pc) and Myanmar Asia World Company (5pc). CPIYN is a wholly owned subsidiary of state-owned China Power Investment Corporation, one of China’s five largest power generation groups.The hydro dam was suspended by President U Thein Sein in September 2011, following some public opposition, and has since remained in limbo.This article has been amended to correct the amount of power the seven Ayeyarwady hydrodams will generate, and the amount of revenue the government is to receive from all seven projects and Myitsone alone.","/business/14887-cpi-pushes-for-restart-of-myitsone-dam.html"
"252",252,"War freezes Kokang econ zone",2015-05-29,"National News","The Kokang economic zone, located at the epicentre of the heavy fighting that broke out in February near the Chinese border, is undamaged but unlikely to come into operation any time soon, local officials said yesterday.          U Kyaw Swe, the secretary of the Kokang self-administered region, told The Myanmar Times that access to the zone was still restricted, as the government has extended martial law over the area until July.“There is no damage to the zone. All the buildings and infrastructure are safe and secured,” he said.The fighting between the Tatmadaw and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) has inflicted an unknown number of casualties oon both sides, and has caused serious disruption to economic development by driving tens of thousands of local residents from their homes. Many crossed the border into China, while others took refuge in Lashio and elsewhere.First mooted in 2009, the Kokang economic zone would be the first to be located in a self-administered area of the country. The government still hopes it will become a model for the development of ethnic areas that have been marked with violence and unrest.The Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) designated Kokang as an official economic zone under the terms of the Foreign Investment Law last October and granted the regional government full authority to supervise it.The Kokang Marlipa Development company is building the infrastructure, and about 30 percent of construction, including electricity and water supplies, were complete when the fighting erupted.The zone is located in Laukkai township at the 125-mile post, just metres away from the border with China. It is expected to provide 20,000 job opportunities, and was supposed to begin operations early next year.“The current situation in Laukkai township is that residents have come back and the authorities are settling them back in. Construction cannot resume in the near future,” said U Kyaw Swe.As of last October, the regional government had been in talks with some investors, mainly from China.Regional government chief U Be Sou Chien said at that time the goal was to move toward value-added food production instead of exporting only raw materials.The region produces mainly sugarcane and rubber.The 1007-acre economic zone encompasses general trading, medium and small industries, hotels, and trading areas for construction materials, agricultural machinery and equipment.“We also aim to add a future economic incentive for the reduction of opium poppy cultivation,” MIC secretary U Aung Naing Oo told The Myanmar Times last October.","/national-news/14745-war-freezes-kokang-econ-zone.html"
"253",253,"Chinese giant works to win the people",2015-05-27,"Business","Though the Kyaukphyu area is set for large-scale investments, it is in Rakhine State, which is also home to some of the country’s poorest communities.           Kyaukphyu hopes to become a hub for the oil and gas industry and is to be home to one of Myanmar’s three Special Economic Zones – yet local residents risk being left behind in the rush to develop.Chinese companies in particular have shown interest in investing the region, with a number of companies entering bids to build parts of the SEZ. No winner has yet emerged, as negotiations, which were set to wrap up in December, have been repeatedly delayed.Yet Chinese investment has proven controversial. Some Chinese companies have provoked popular backlashes, including the firms behind the Myitsone dam and the Letpadaung copper mine. Others, though, are looking to change their approaches from deals resting on government to agreements with broad popular support – which often includes a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) component.CITIC claims to be the largest Chinese conglomerate. Japanese investors and Thailand’s CP Group owning a significant portion of the firm. CITIC is trying its hand at local CSR as it also looks at local business activities, such as bidding for some of the Kyaukphyu SEZ work.CITIC Construction vice president Frank Ma Chuanfu said his firm realises it needs to communicate on the ground level to overcome some negative perceptions of China people. In the past, some government-to-government business has run into trouble, and it will take time to overcome these perceptions.The company is importing a CSR project it has run in Thailand for 15 years. The program gives a US$1.5 million grant to the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development to fund projects in 50 selected villages across the country. Most states or regions will end up with three such selected villages.“Kyaukphyu is in one of the least developed areas, and we are concerned for the CSR project there,” said Frank Ma Chaunfu.Each of the 50 selected villages will receive K30 million (US$27,000) to serve as an agricultural development fund, managed by a committee made up of elected villagers.The program aims to function as a targeted microfinance program. Poramete Aridete, director of National Village Fund Thailand, said at first individual loans will be no more than K200,000, for periods of not more than one year. The program’s representatives will also purchase the agricultural implements on behalf of the committees, rather than the committees purchasing them directly.The loans are set at a rate of 0.5 percent per month, for a maximum of 6pc per year, well below the usual microfinance limit of 30pc a year.Visiting Ma-u-pyein village, one of the first Myanmar villages in the program, requires a three-hour boat ride and a half-hour hike over a mountain range from Kyaukphyu. It is a remote area, and the poverty and need for capital is evident.Local villagers said the rates on offer with CITIC’s program are attractive, but they are still unsure about the program.“We’re unhappy with our alternative rates, as we have to give between 15 to 20pc minimum a month for informal lending,” said U Ba Shwe, a village fund committee member from Gantgar North village in Kyaukphyu tonwship.“But we still have questions for the training team, as these kind of programs are new for us.”U Ba Shwe said the limit on the first loans of K200,000 is too small for those looking to start a business from the proceeds, but in the future it may become more money.Others say that while the program is helpful on the whole, they are worried about the possibility of corruption with these activities.Ma Su, 30, said the K200,000 limit per person had not been strictly adhered to, with some connected villagers ending up with K2 million and others only K50,000.“That’s only enough money to buy one piglet,” he said. “How can we make a bigger profit?”Although business has arrived, locals said they have not connected the two.Another labourer working at a nearby jetty, Daw Aung Thein Hla, 38, says she does know about the plans for Kyaukphyu SEZ, despite living in Kyaukphyu town.“I have no idea what I’ll be doing if those projects arrive,” she said, after reporters explained the purpose of the SEZ.","/business/14697-chinese-giant-works-to-win-the-people.html"
"254",254,"Approved investment spikes in April with oil and gas projects",2015-05-26,"Business","Approved Foreign Direct Investment approvals jumped in April on the back of significant declared investment in the oil and gas industry, according to statistics.          A total of US$2.2 billion worth of declared investments were approved in April, with more than $2 billion of that from the oil and gas sector. The government has targeted $6 billion in FDI for the current fiscal year, after reaching $8 billion in 2014-15 and about $4 billion for 2013-14.“This fiscal year, FDI will flow in, more than last year,” said Myanmar Investment Commission secretary U Aung Naing Oo. “We can easily meet the target.”The FDI figures represents investment that has been approved by the Myanmar Investment Commission, rather than actual investment, though the April. Experts say the figures are worth considering for long-term trends, but tend to be lumpy and move around quickly in the short term.“Approval data is what private companies say they’re going to do. What they actually end up doing can be different than what say they will do,” said Peter Brimble, Myanmar principal country specialist at the Asian Development Bank.Still, Mr Brimble said approvals do to an extent reflect investors’ interest, and is an important gauge when considered over time.The latest figures for April indicate about $2 billion in oil and gas, with the rest in hotels and tourism, manufacturing, and other sectors.The oil and gas figures come as a number of international energy firms have recently received Myanmar Investment Commission approval to move ahead with projects, as the winners of last year’s large offshore tender have mostly finished signing Production Sharing Contracts in the first few months of the calendar year.Officials have been vocal toward inviting foreign investment to enter, for instance providing tax incentives to companies registering under the Foreign Investment Law.U Aung Naing Oo said officials are preparing for the effects of increased foreign investment.“At the same time the investment is coming in, we need to keep watch on rules and regulations,” he said.Still, the sell is not always easy. Foreign companies must contend with shortages of skilled labour, poor transportation links and, for some, issues of compliance.“FDI is flowing, but it is still difficult to compete with other countries,” said one businessman. “For instance, there is often not enough electricity to compete with regional competitors.”Oil and gas has consistently been attracting some of the largest investments. In the fiscal year ending March 31, oil and gas comprised $3.2 billion of the $8.1 billion total, followed by transportation and communications at $1.7 billion and manufacturing at $1.5 billion. Myanmar received $54.2 billion in foreign direct investment from 895 permitted companies from 38 countries from 1988-2015.China is the top investor in Myanmar, with 74 Chinese enterprises having invested $14.8 billion during the period. However, its figures have recently decline.The second-overall source of investment from 1988 to 2015 is Thailand, with $10.3 billion, and Singapore with $10 billion. Additional reporting by Jeremy Mullins","/business/14676-approved-investment-spikes-in-april-with-oil-and-gas-projects.html"
"255",255,"Environmental and social standards await final approval to move forward",2015-05-14,"Business","A major issue surrounding project implementation in Myanmar is the way environmental and social impact assessment (EIA/SIA) reports are conducted. Without clear legislation, many investment projects struggle to complete this critical step.          The Environmental Conservation Law was enacted in March 2012 and its rules and regulations were made public in June last year.Foreign investors are obliged to comply with this law. However, the local practice of completing EIA/SIA reports still needs improvement, and investors and regulators are trying to put together a standard procedure to guide the process.“We are going to publish a standard EIA/SIA procedure soon, around June,” said U Kyaw San Naing, a director from the Environmental Conversation Department (ECD) under the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry (MOECAF).The department has finalised a standard EIA/SIA procedure which has been sent to the cabinet and Attorney General’s Office for final approval. The procedure will offer clear instructions to companies on how to complete the reports.“It is really important that these procedures are published. We need a solid legal base for companies to work from, and just one set of rules rather than different practices in different sectors and locations,” said Vicky Bowman, director of the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business (MCRB).The EIA/SIA regulations will cover a range of sectors, including real estate, infrastructure and electricity, but the extractive industries are most in need of clear guidelines.At the moment, only a few mining projects are in operation, focusing on gold, jade and other mineral resources.The sector will not thrive without a standard EIA/SIA procedure, because without a set of clear guidelines, companies are likely to run into controversies.For example, the long-running conflict at Letpadaung Copper Mine near Monywa is partially resolved, but could be reignited at any time.As previously reported by The Myanmar Times, protests over land grabs have broken out sporadically at Letpadaung since Chinese firm Wanbao – a subsidiary of arms manufacturer Norinco – and army-owned Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited signed an agreement to develop the mine in 2010.The conflict between the company and local residents has impacted other extractive industry players.“It is becoming more difficult to organise Corporate Social Responsibility [CSR] projects due to the impact of conflicts such as this,” said an official from French energy giant Total, which has been operating in Myanmar for more than 20 years.For corporations, CSR activities may lead to positive brand perception, while Myanmar has promoted CSR spending because of the benefits it brings to local communities.Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) conducted three international bidding rounds in 2011 and 2013 for onshore and offshore oil and gas blocks. A total of 45 onshore and offshore blocks were awarded to international oil companies. The Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) for awarded blocks have been signed and only a few blocks remain to be allocated to investors.Those international oil companies must complete EIA/SIA surveys before they can progress to the exploration phase, according to the Ministry of Energy.However, it is unclear how companies will complete the required reports without a standard EIA/SIA procedure.The respective government ministries and organisations have negotiated to allow oil companies to proceed with seismic acquisition before the standard procedure is published.“At the request of related ministries and organisations, we will allow the oil companies to continue their work with the Initial Environmental Examination [IEE] report. The full EIA/SIA reports should be submitted later, once the company reaches the discovery stage in the exploration period,” said U Kyaw San Naing.UK-based Ophir Energy was the first company to begin a seismic campaign with its IEE report just after it signed a PSC.So far, around 10 EIA and IEE reports have been presented by oil companies to the ECD, to be approved by the independent review team. A total of 26 local and 24 international organisations are working on EIA/SIA and IEE services at present according to ECD’s records.“These EIA/SIA service companies or organisations will have to register for a working licence once we have published the EIA/SIA regulations. We will be able to take action against service companies if their reports are not in line with the procedures,” said U Kyaw San Naing.Publishing a standard EIA/SIA procedure is not the only way to promote transparency, environmental conservation and social well being.However, MOECAF, which is tasked with overseeing this process, lacks resources.“The main problem is capacity-building among our staff and the pressure to complete dozens of projects in time,” said U Kyaw San Naing.He said that the ministry is receiving technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, among other international institutions, but more resources are still needed.“They need a lot more qualified staff to cope with the influx of new investment as well as the backlog. They will also need to have technical advisers on standby for several years to help them assess the reports they receive,” said Ms Bowman.“If EIA/SIAs are conducted transparently, to an international standard, they can be used to raise standards across the sector and create more of a level playing field,” she said.Myanmar became an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Candidate Country in July 2014. But the process of delivering the first EITI report is still being discussed by members of the Multi Stakeholders Group, which includes representatives from the government, civil society organisations and private companies.","/business/14457-environmental-and-social-standards-await-final-approval-to-move-forward.html"
"256",256,"Book Review: China’s next big export: state-sponsored ecocide",2015-05-08,"Lifestyle","In September 2011, President U Thein Sein ordered the suspension of the Myitsone Dam in Kachin State for the duration of his term in office, which ends later this year.           The announcement came in the midst of an ongoing campaign supported by environmental and civil society groups that focused on the image of the Ayeyarwady as the cultural lifeblood of Myanmar, and that highlighted worries that the dam would destroy downstream fisheries, rice production and livelihoods.The 6000-megawatt Myitsone project, which would supply electricity to China while displacing about 20,000 people in Kachin, is only part of a series of seven dams on the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwady planned by the China’s state-owned Chinese Power Investment Corporation.The Chinese company has made clear its desire to resume the Myitsone project, but many locals and civil society groups want it cancelled altogether. The issue promises to re-emerge as a major conflict following the end of U Thein Sein’s tenure as president.Whatever the outcome, Myanmar will remain at the mercy of China’s insatiable greed for energy, warns Canadian author Michael Buckley in his 2014 book Meltdown in Tibet.This is due to the negative environmental fallout from rampant dam-building and mining projects in Tibet, which will affect the 2 billion people – in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Bhutan and Pakistan – who rely on the 10 major rivers that originate on the Tibetan plateau for drinking, agriculture, fishing and industry.Among these rivers are Myanmar’s Thanlwin (Salween) and Ayeyarwady.Buckley first visited Tibet in the 1980s as a guidebook writer, and the environmental degradation he witnessed over time prompted him to produce the 40-minute documentary film Meltdown in Tibet (2009), and last year a book of the same name.The author describes what is happening in Tibet as “ecocide” and contends that China is destroying Tibet “on all fronts”.“The wildlife in Tibet was one of the first casualties of the Chinese occupation. Another casualty was clear-cutting the forests,” he says.Meanwhile, Tibet’s glaciers are melting fast, and China is “aggravating the situation” with massive dam-building and mining projects. Buckley’s book supplies numerous statistics for a litany of “hydro megaprojects” in China that have already started affecting countries downriver, as well as for projects in the planning stages that will magnify the devastation.“What appears to be just a Tibetan Plateau problem or a Chinese problem is going to become an Asia-wide problem. There are no boundaries when it comes to environmental impact,” he writes, warning that as a result of China’s policies “Asia will tumble into chaos”.Among the downstream effects of China’s frenzy for “progress” will be the destruction of fisheries and the blockage of nutrient-rich silt vital to farming. Without fresh silt, farmers must resort to increased use of expensive, environmentally destructive artificial fertilisers. Another casualty will be mangrove forests.“Mangroves are your first line of defence against sea-level rise and against cyclones,” Buckley said during his appearance at the Irrawaddy Literary Festival in Mandalay in March.“But mangroves need silt and fresh water to grow. If you put a dam upriver, silt and fresh water are not getting through to the mangroves, and the mangroves will slowly disappear, which leaves you open to disasters along the coast.”This is of particular concern in Bangladesh as well as in Myanmar’s Ayeyarwady delta.Buckley has visited the site of the Myitsone Dam, and in an interview with Mizzima last month he posed two questions concerning the current state of the project: “Why are the Chinese workers still there? Why are the people who lived there not allowed to come back?” He is clearly unconvinced that the dam will ever be officially cancelled.He is also concerned about the Thanlwin, which he describes as “a virgin river untouched by big dams”. But China aims to nullify this idyllic state of affairs with plans for five major hydropower projects.“If they build the five dams that are planned, it means [Myanmar’s] water flow can be controlled by China at any point,” Buckley said.“China will say, ‘We’re solving your flooding problems.’ But most downstream countries want the flooding because they need it for rice and fishing. It’s an annual cycle. So the Chinese dams do not solve the problem, they only create other problems. By the time they put all those dams up, they’re going to ruin the river and affect the people who depend on the river.”Buckley said that in supporting the construction of dams on the Ayeyarwady and the Thanlwin, Myanmar would be sacrificing its own people and environment for the sake of greed.“But who can stop China? Nobody can stop China because they’re too entangled in economic relations and nobody wants to upset the Chinese government. So they’re getting away with this,” he said. “It’s insane what China is doing.”","/lifestyle/14364-china-s-next-big-export-state-sponsored-ecocide.html"

Roc Oil and its partners Tap Oil and Smart E&P won the rights to the block in a 2014 bidding round for a total of 20 offshore blocks. Production Sharing Contracts, which govern resource exploration and extraction, have now been inked by the likes of Shell, Chevron and Total for the other 19 blocks, with only M-7 remaining to be finalised.“Roc Oil has pulled out of the bidding group. We are now restructuring procedures to move forward with the Production Sharing Contract,” said a Ministry of Energy official, who declined to be named as he is not allowed to speak to the media.The official said Roc’s decision to pull out may be related to its purchase by a subsidiary of China-based Fosun International earlier this year, in a deal that saw Roc Oil de-listed from the Australian stock exchange.“De-listing means its owners don’t want to make new investments,” said the official. He added the Production Sharing Contract will now be signed with Tap Oil and its local partner.Neither Tap Oil or Roc Oil had returned request for comment by yesterday, though Tap Oil’s March 2015 quarterly report, released April 30, does confirm the move.“In April, Roc Oil advised the [Ministry of Energy] and the joint venture that it has withdrawn from the bidding group. The remaining joint venture participants, Tap and Smart E&P International Ltd, its local joint venture participant, are in discussions with the [Ministry of Energy] regarding the award of the [Production Sharing Contract],” it said.Service company Smart E&P is one of Myanmar’s better-known oil and gas companies.Smart chair U Kyaw Kyaw Hlaing said he had been aware for some time that the ownership of Roc Oil had changed hands.“We knew the Chinese company bought Roc Oil. But it has only been a month since we were informed by Roc that it is withdrawing from our group,” he said.Tap Oil has agreed to take over rights to block M-7 and to finalise production sharing terms and conditions with Myanmar authorities.“We have presented our partnership with Tap Oil for M-7 to Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise,” he said. “Now we are waiting for their response to move on with signing the Production Sharing Contract.”Government officials had initially hoped to have all 20 Production Sharing Contracts finalised by last month, though it will likely be June at the earliest before the government gives the adjusted partnership the official green light.The shallow-water M-7 block is in the Mottama basin, covering some 13,000 square kilometres (5019 square miles). It lies near three of Myanmar’s four offshore sites that are in production, including Yadana and Zawtika.The Myanmar Investment Commission issued permission in March to Roc Oil, Tap and Smart E&P to invest in M-7.","/business/14312-roc-oil-backs-out-of-last-unsigned-block.html"
"258",258,"Traders yuan-der about China exchange",2015-05-05,"Business","A YUAN-KYAT trading centre has opened near the main overland China-Myanmar trade portal, though businesspeople say it may take some time to catch on.           Traders usually clear payments through informal hundi networks rather than formal banks, particularly for border trade.The gateway between Ruili in China and Muse in northern Shan State has become Myanmar’s largest overland trading point, though local facilities have not kept up with rising volumes of goods passing through.Ministry of Commerce adviser U Maung Aung said the exchange is an example of efforts by the two countries to facilitate trade.In border areas, the government will allow trading in kyat, China’s yuan and the US dollar.The China Daily reports that Chinese authorities have consildated four existing currency exchange agencies into the centre. The new centre aims to form an index number for Ruili, gradually standardising the yuan-kyat market and also promoting bilateral trade.Although some traders in the area say they are put off by the informal nature of financing arrangements, most see no reason to move over to the official exchange centre.U Soe Naing, managing director of Maha Nyiko Trading companies, which specialise in selling Myanmar agricultural products to Ruili, said official exchange centres and bank branches often are too restricted to be effective.The official counters often limit daily exchanges to below 30,000 yuan (US$4800), though traders often need several times this amount each day, he said. “The [informal] way has been suitable for traders for years. Opening banks or exchanges centres will not help to increase trade volumes,” he said. “I don’t think selling in the informal markets is uncomfortable, and I never feel it is unsecure.”Muse-based rice trader U Sai Kyaw said he is aware of the official exchange, which opened at the end of March, but he has not used it.Most rice traders open a bank account in China, in Ruili or Jiegao, and use it for their business. To repatriate profits in kyat, he makes use of informal currency exchanges, he said.State banks, such as Myanma Investment and Commerical Bank and Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, often do not have enough branches to serve traders on the remote borders, while routing money through Myanma Economic Bank means the traders have to pay tax.Traders also say that transferring money between accounts can take a long time and cause bottlenecks, while the hundi system is much more responsive.Commercial banks also place restrictions on trade in Thai baht and Chinese yuan, which hundi does not.U Tin Ye Win, a government official who worked at Muse until April, said most traders currently use kyat or yuan through hundi, but it ought to be changed over time.“Traders have their own ways. They buy goods and use currencies of each country, but not officially. It is convenient to some extent, but not for all – but this should be changed,” he said.Trade between China and Myanmar reached about US$6 billion in 2014-15, with about 80 percent completed overland, according to official figures.Myanmar extensively imports Chinese consumer goods, while exporting resources from the extractive industries, as well as agricultural products such as rubber, pulses and fruit.U Tin Ye Win said armed groups on the border often look to profit from exporting items such as timber, jade and mined products. However, their illegal take has slowly been dropping off as the government asserts control, he said.Rebels had attacked a branch of Myawaddy Bank in Muse last week, an example of threatening the public and other businesses, he said.Additional reportingby Khin Su Wai","/business/14288-traders-yuan-der-about-china-exchange.html"
"259",259,"Garment industry disputes mean fewer orders and worried factory owners",2015-04-07,"Business","Labour disputes in the garment industry, a main driver of Myanmar’s growing exports, have had a serious impact on orders from abroad and risk scaring away foreign investors, according to South Korean officials and sector representatives.          Disputes over workers’ demand for higher wages affected output at two South Korean factories and three Chinese-owned enterprises in Yangon earlier this year until a tough police crackdown in February got most workers back to the production lines.Workers were demanding an extra 30,000 kyats (US$28) a month in wages.“There is a really serious problem with orders,” said Chu Hyun-oh of Suitstar Garment company and representative of the South Korean manufacturers’ association. “The future of the garment business in Myanmar looks gloomy,” he told The Myanmar Times.Myanmar representatives of the industry and union leaders had a much more upbeat perspective however, noting record exports last year. There is also the hope that orderly elections later this year could lead to an upsurge in orders from the US.Mr Chu said that last year Myanmar had successfully attracted foreign investors who were lured by lower production costs compared with China. But labour costs had risen by some 25 percent and could rise further on the back of wage increases recently granted by the government to civil servants. He said foreign investors were urging the government to help resolve labour disputes by finalising an overdue law setting a minimum wage.“Many buyers are watching the situation closely,” he said, explaining that they could easily switch orders to other countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Laos.South Korean and Chinese companies are the largest foreign investors in Myanmar in the garment and related sectors. About 140 South Korean companies employ around 100,000 workers. An easing of US and EU sanctions since President U Thein Sein’s reformist government took office in 2011 has led to an industry rebound.The Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association said that, based on an analysis of data in the first half of the 2013-14 fiscal year just ended, exports were on track to reach a record high of $1.7 billion, a near doubling of exports in just two years.South Korean ambassador Lee Baek-soon said labour disputes that turned violent risked scaring away South Korean investors in Myanmar.“Now they are thinking twice about staying for long or whether they might relocate to another country. It is a red signal,” he said in an interview. “There are many South Korean factories in China and Vietnam. From time to time they come here to do market surveys on possible relocation, but if they hear of labour disputes they will be hesitant,” he said, stressing the potential to create thousands more jobs.The ambassador said that a monthly wage increase of K30,000 represented a rise of 40pc. He called this “intolerable” and would risk driving many factories into bankruptcy. He said garment sector wages in Myanmar were 30pc to 40pc lower than in Vietnam, but productivity was 20pc to 30pc less and Myanmar lagged far behind in terms of infrastructure.“Job creation is much more important than labour rights at the initial stage of economic development,” he said.Ambassador Lee confirmed that he had asked the police in Yangon to provide protection for a South Korean manager and a group of Myanmar workers who he said had been blockaded in their Costec factory on February 3 by striking workers outside.“That is all we asked for,” he said, insisting that he had not called for a subsequent crackdown when police wielding batons broke up a demonstration of mostly young female strikers.The ambassador stressed that only a small number of South Korean-owned factories had gone through labour disputes and that they had resumed operations. The rest, he said, had good relations with their workers and wanted to enhance fringe benefits, such as providing dormitories and night-schools.U Aung Lin, chair of the Myanmar Trade Unions Federation, dismissed talk of foreign investors leaving. “This was said by the government for show,” he said.He called on the government to help resolve labour disputes by completing the enactment of laws governing foreign investment, settlement of disputes, minimum wages, employment and skill development. The laws lacked enforcement and were deficient, he said.Workers were aware of their rights but the law on the right to strike was confusing and unclear to workers, he said.Wage increases could be granted if it were not for the extra expenses that employers had for renting factories, coping with power outages, logistics and “under the table money” for senior officials, he said. He also rejected the concept that job creation came before labour rights.“Workers are not slaves, they are human beings as well. If they had got their rights, for sure they would not strike anymore,” he said, arguing that labour rights and creating jobs should go hand in hand.However, on one issue he and the ambassador both agreed – that “external activists” had been involved in stoking the labour disputes. Neither elaborated on who these activists were. “We don’t know exactly who they are. We have hunches. I cannot say if they were South Korean or not,” the ambassador said.Daw Khine Khine Nwe, general secretary of the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association (MGMA), said Western investors were still hesitating over committing to Myanmar but not Chinese or other Asian investors who were drawn by its large and relatively young workforce.Jacob Clere, MGMA project manager, said Myanmar’s “slightly unclear” policy framework still “scares” investors despite the passage of legislation in recent years. “Investors like stability and they like transparency, and if the policy framework, the rule of law is not very consistent, that makes them nervous,” he said.The industry is hoping that US markets for Myanmar’s garment products will recover further, with parliamentary elections set for November seen as a landmark event.“If they [the US government] are satisfied with the elections, then they might consider easing the pathway of US businesses wanting to do business in Myanmar. Because if there were a few small changes, then it would be very easy for US brands to start sourcing here,” he said, arguing that the US market could potentialy reclaim its position as Myanmar’s top export market.“Japanese, Korean buyers haven’t always had the same ideas about social compliance as Europe and the US. They have their own approach ... For that reason Myanmar missed out on what was basically at that time a trend toward increasingly responsible manufacturing,” Mr Clere said.Mr Clere said the wage rates could be criticised but they were high enough that jobs were attracting people to move to Yangon from rural areas, and that, for example, garment factories paid more than the food processing sector.“But in terms of labour unrest, it’s a worry because it’s been a big problem in other countries. A lot of brands and a lot of producers would like to see Myanmar do it better. I think a lot of people feel this kind of optimism, that Myanmar has a chance to do it better. A lot of people are trying to push things in that direction,” he said.Additional reporting byCatherine Trautwein andNyan Lynn Aung","/business/13948-garment-industry-disputes-mean-fewer-orders-and-worried-factory-owners.html"
"260",260,"Premier owners to bring coffee mix to American shelves through venture",2015-04-06,"Business","The local makers of Premier coffee have received approval to export a similar coffee product to the United States, according to company representatives.           The brand name has been changed to Ideal Tastes, but the product will be similar to the popular Myanmar brand Premier, according to Lim Chong Chong, chief financial officer for Capital Diamond Star Group, a large local company.Branding on the package of the instant coffee will be in English, Chinese, Spanish, Vietnamese and Korean.“It’s very targeted in the US market in terms of population demographics,” said Mr Lim.He added the product has received approval from America’s Food and Drug Administration. There is a local partner lined up, and exports are to be done in the next three to six months.The move to begin exports comes as Capital Diamond Star teams up with Japanese giant Mitsubishi Corporation in a new food products venture. The firm, called Lluvia, was announced early last week, though many of the details were not released until April 2.The partners claim they will invest US$200 million in new money over the next three years in the new firm. Mitsubishi will hold up to 30 percent of the venture, with Capital Diamond Star owning the rest.Capital Diamond Star is headed by Myanmar entrepreneur U Ko Ko Gyi, a businessperson with Mandalay roots. The firm was founded in the 1960s as a trading business, and has since branded into other businesses, including retail with Capital Hypermart and Grab and Go convenience stores, automotive with Ford, and other businesses such as construction and microfinance.Some of its existing assets in the food business will part of the new Lluvia venture, including its wheat flour, coffee and distribution businesses. The Lluvia venture also aims to expand into businesses such as non-dairy creamer, UHT milk production, rice milling, packaging, cold chain logistics, ports and a bakery school.Speaking at a press conference on April 2, Mr Lim said Lluvia aims to have a regional footprint.“We definitely intend to make Premier a regional brand,” he said. “We also intend to make some of the other brands into regional brands.”The firm also owns Diamond Star flour, which it claims has about 55pc market share domestically.It is looking at a number of options for exports, including its Ideal Tastes brand to the United States, as well as other opportunities in Southeast Asia and the rest of the continent.Mitsubishi Corporation Myanmar team leader Gen Murakami said his company sees huge potential in Myanmar’s food industry.“You’re very close to the food source, ingredients, raw materials,” he said. “On the other hand if we look to the market, most of the food products, processed products especially, are still imported.”Mr Murakami added that if more investment, technological transfer and upgrades can occur, the future will be bright for the domestic food industry.Mitsubishi Corporation also has partnerships with Serge Pun-chaired businesses, including in Thilawa and Mandalay airport. Mr Murakami said the Lluvia venture will focus on food and food-related businesses, adding Capital Diamond Star Group (CDSG) is the best partner in Myanmar to team up with.“The strength of CDSG in the food business in Myanmar already, having everything from agriculture-related businesses all the way downstream to retail, is something we think we can work together to expand,” he told The Myanmar Times.Asked about a potential listing on the Yangon Stock Exchange or a regional market by Lluvia or CDSG, Mr Lim said the firm is keeping its options open.“So we are not saying no to the capital markets, whether it’s domestic or international, but it’s not something we’re actively seeking,” he said.Mr Lim said he is now focused on growing the business and on building up its fundamentals.“When you have good governance, your finance partners will feel comfortable working with you. For us, it’s about building the fundamentals of the business. That’s our number one priority,” he said.","/business/13916-premier-owners-to-bring-coffee-mix-to-american-shelves-through-venture.html"
"261",261,"Homecoming: Tough conversations with old friends",2015-03-30,"Editor's Pick","Born in Yangon and living in San Francisco, Kenneth Wong sizes up the reform process as it looks from a distance, facing up to some uncomfortable truths.          Under Yangon’s clear blue sky, my taxi sped along University Avenue. It was my second trip to my homeland since I’d immigrated to the US in 1989. I wanted to see with my own eyes the so-called reforms that Thein Sein’s government claimed to be implementing. Usually, mounds of trash hugged the sidewalks, fritter stands invaded the pavements, and bumper-to-bumper gridlocks snarled traffic. But not that day.My driver U Aung Myint was a man of few words. When he spoke, he chose his words carefully, perhaps a survival skill honed under decades of military rule. He quipped, “Next time we want to clear the streets, we should just invite the American president over.”That day – November 19, 2012 – Myanmar unveiled its new face to President Obama, the first sitting US president to visit the country. With a hasty coat of paint on Yangon University, the new government had prepared a clean-swept cityscape for the historic occasion. That was the photogenic backdrop that framed the articles that ran in the following day’s Time magazine, The New York Times and The Washington Post.The hour of Obama’s appearance drew near. A group of young boys on the street called timeout from their soccer game to find a cafe with a TV screen; some sidecar operators huddled around a battery-operated radio to catch the broadcast. Then Obama spoke. His first words were “Myanmar naing gan, mingalabar!” (Greetings, the country of Myanmar!). He had them at hello.I watched local schoolkids in white and green, carrying signs that read “Welcome Mr Obama!” In my Facebook newsfeed, I saw the Former Political Prisoners Association’s photos of newly released dissidents reuniting with their loved ones, smiles and tears all around. Swept up in the mass euphoria, I was willing to overlook that many of the current government were formerly generals who had signed arrest warrants for these student leaders, following the 1988 protests and crackdowns.On the same trip, I also came across reminders of the cloistered society’s conservatism and prejudice, nurtured in the shadow of isolation. Whereas I as a man could freely go into the inner sanctums of some sacred shrines, my sister and mother were explicitly forbidden from these sections on account of their womanhood. People squirmed when I mentioned the Rakhine-Muslim conflict; they tensed up when I uttered the tabooed word “Rohingya”. But I didn’t want the soap bubble to burst. So I deferred the uncomfortable conversations, postponed the confrontations, and trusted the reform process would bring out the best in people.This March, I saw the spectre of military rule in the police’s use of force to break up the student protests in Letpadan. One week later, three people – a New Zealander and two of his Myanmar associates – were sentenced to two years in prison for publishing a poster depicting Buddha with headphones to promote a bar. The religious hardliners who called for the prosecution of the trio were the same ones championing a bill to deter interfaith marriages between Buddhist and Muslims.What surprised and saddened me most was reading the online comments from some of my old friends who showed sympathy – if not outright support – for the hardliners. That convinced me that I must make clear my own positions on a variety of subjects, even if doing so put my relationship with some people in jeopardy. After all, transparency is the bedrock of reform.In the heart of downtown Yangon, glass-encased Sakura Tower overshadows Sule Pagoda’s gold-tipped spires. In teashops, cellphone-juggling teens in Mohawk cuts and skinny jeans sit next to saffron-robbed monks. The space between Myanmar’s enduring traditions and encroaching modernity is getting smaller, growing tighter. A head-on collision is inevitable. My own conscience is the battleground where the two often clash.I grew up under Ne Win’s quasi-Socialist government in the 1980s. I had always had nagging questions about the signs marking certain sections of the pagodas off-limit to women, about the jokes we told at the expense of Hindu and Muslim kids, and about the ugly caricatures of Chinese and Indian merchants that appeared in some journals and comics. But I brushed them all aside as part of the country’s social construct, its quirks that didn’t harm anybody.Perhaps they’re not so harmless. In the small opening provided by the reform, these attitudes found new outlets. The controversial monk Wirathu’s popularity remains undiminished even after he’d publicly called a UN special rapporteur a “whore”. His conduct is a reflection of the religious conservatism that sees women as less than man.Aung Myo Min, who participated in the 1988 uprising as a university student, fled to neighboring Thailand to avoid arrest. His exile abroad would last 24 years. In 2012, he finally returned home and founded the Equality Myanmar network. As an openly gay activist, I knew he had to have attracted more than his fair share of ire from the hardliners. So I reached out to him via Facebook.“I face challenges for speaking out on behalf of minority groups, such as women and LGBT,” he said. “I was attacked [in the media] several times for being LGBT and strongly supporting women’s rights, particularly against the interfaith marriage bill. I’ve received death threats on my Viber account, email and SMS.”In December 12, 2014, issue of Aung Zeyatu journal, a columnist accused Aung Myo Min of “speaking the Devil’s words”. Using a Burmese maxim, the author described Aung Myo Min as “a blind elephant stumbling through a forest”.In response Aung Myo Min remarked, “Some people interpret human rights as something that belongs to them but not to others – that is especially true of the minorities’ rights.”In 2011, after spending almost two decades behind bars, my classmate Richard Aung was freed, just days before Hillary Clinton was set to arrive. Richard is now part of the Sanchaung branch of the NLD. Two years ago, when I met him again in person, I spent a memorable evening playing guitars with him in Yangon University, pretending to be our 20-year-old selves as we serenaded the hostel students in the windows.I caught up with him on Skype last week. “Have you lost friends over your stance on religion, race, or the [religious hardliners’] Race Protection Organisation?” I asked him. He chuckled.“I have my own convictions guiding me on those, and they’re crystal clear to me,” he said. “If some people want to hate me because they disagree with me, let them. But I must say, I have never hated anybody because of their race or their religion.”“Do these topics tend to come up when you get together with classmates and old friends?” I asked.“I know some friends have strong religious views. I leave them alone and they let me be,” he said. “When we get together, we talk about old times, but avoid these sensitive topics. It’s not like we made a pledge not to talk about them, but I think people realise their sensitivity.”Richard urged me to look beyond the sectarian conflicts and see the puppet masters. “Look at the police’s show of force to respond to the student protests in Letpadan,” he said. “And look at how little effort was made to stop the violence in Meiktila [where religious riots killed dozens and displaced thousands in March 2013]. This shows you this government’s true nature.”I also tracked down the phone number for taxi-man U Aung Myint. His familiar voice came through Skype. I asked him how he felt about the reforms.“I’m not that interested in politics,” he said. “I’m just trying to make a living. I’ll respect whoever becomes president, whether it’s Daw Suu or some official from the current administration. If I can make a comfortable living, I can live with that.”I had heard of the religious hardliners campaigning to boycott the Muslims in daily commerce. In the taxi community, that would take the form of stickers bearing the sign 969, which signals to the passenger that the operator is a Buddhist. Some claim the sticker is no more than a symbol, as innocent as the image of a saint or a cross. But I imagine Muslims might see it differently, because the same three digits are prominently featured at the Race Protection Organisation’s gatherings. Both Richard Aung and U Aung Myint told me they hadn’t seen Yangon taxi drivers using the sticker as means to discriminate against passengers belonging to other faiths. Still, I had to ask.“Is there a 969 sticker on your car?” I asked, holding my breath for the answer.“No,” said U Aung Myint. “I keep a Buddha figurine in my car. People can tell I’m a Buddhist just from that. I don’t need to hang a 969 sticker.”I reminded him of the joke he made about the best way to clear up traffic in Yangon – by inviting President Obama back for another visit. Obama, in fact, did return for a second visit last November.“But in his second visit, I ran into a traffic jam,” U Aung Myint revealed. “At the 8 Mile junction, I and my foreigner passenger were stuck in traffic for 45 minutes, waiting for Obama to pass.”Myanmar is waking up from a long nightmare. The 51 million who live within it are well acquainted with the Buddhist principle of impermanence. But change is still hard. The reform brought Hillary Clinton, President Obama and Jason Mraz to the country. It also paved the way for the first LGBT film festival in Yangon; and ushered in tourists with Buddhist symbols tattooed on their limbs. Some of the country’s youth unleashed their pent-up energy during the water festival, with shorter skirts and edgier shirts each year. Some of these developments boosted the population’s morale. Others made the conservatives feel under siege.The country’s Buddhist clergy has always held a powerful sway over the population. Its role in national politics stretched back to the colonial days; and its heroism in the 2007 Saffron uprising rightfully garnered the world’s admiration. But how will it react to the separation of Church and State, a basic rule in secular government? The support enjoyed by Wirathu and the Race Protection Organisation is significant. It suggests some in the religious community are not willing to settle for a smaller role. Quite the opposite: they’re seeking to exert more influence on secular affairs.Some citizens, either out of disinterest or weariness, may drop out of the political process altogether, focusing instead on day-to-day survival like U Aung Myint. For others like my friend Richard Aung, the years they’d sacrificed behind bars was far too great an investment, so they must push ahead. Advocates like Aung Myo Min have a tough job ahead.

"262",262,"The difficult conversations I must have with my Myanmar friends",2015-03-30,"National News","Born in Yangon and living in San Francisco, Kenneth Wong sizes up the reform process as it looks from a distance, facing up to some uncomfortable truths.          Under Yangon’s clear blue sky, my taxi sped along University Avenue. It was my second trip to my homeland since I’d immigrated to the US in 1989. I wanted to see with my own eyes the so-called reforms that Thein Sein’s government claimed to be implementing. Usually, mounds of trash hugged the sidewalks, fritter stands invaded the pavements, and bumper-to-bumper gridlocks snarled traffic. But not that day.My driver U Aung Myint was a man of few words. When he spoke, he chose his words carefully, perhaps a survival skill honed under decades of military rule. He quipped, “Next time we want to clear the streets, we should just invite the American president over.”That day – November 19, 2012 – Myanmar unveiled its new face to President Obama, the first sitting US president to visit the country. With a hasty coat of paint on Yangon University, the new government had prepared a clean-swept cityscape for the historic occasion. That was the photogenic backdrop that framed the articles that ran in the following day’s Time magazine, The New York Times and The Washington Post.The hour of Obama’s appearance drew near. A group of young boys on the street called timeout from their soccer game to find a cafe with a TV screen; some sidecar operators huddled around a battery-operated radio to catch the broadcast. Then Obama spoke. His first words were “Myanmar naing gan, mingalabar!” (Greetings, the country of Myanmar!). He had them at hello.I watched local schoolkids in white and green, carrying signs that read “Welcome Mr Obama!” In my Facebook newsfeed, I saw the Former Political Prisoners Association’s photos of newly released dissidents reuniting with their loved ones, smiles and tears all around. Swept up in the mass euphoria, I was willing to overlook that many of the current government were formerly generals who had signed arrest warrants for these student leaders, following the 1988 protests and crackdowns.On the same trip, I also came across reminders of the cloistered society’s conservatism and prejudice, nurtured in the shadow of isolation. Whereas I as a man could freely go into the inner sanctums of some sacred shrines, my sister and mother were explicitly forbidden from these sections on account of their womanhood. People squirmed when I mentioned the Rakhine-Muslim conflict; they tensed up when I uttered the tabooed word “Rohingya”. But I didn’t want the soap bubble to burst. So I deferred the uncomfortable conversations, postponed the confrontations, and trusted the reform process would bring out the best in people.This March, I saw the spectre of military rule in the police’s use of force to break up the student protests in Letpadan. One week later, three people – a New Zealander and two of his Myanmar associates – were sentenced to two years in prison for publishing a poster depicting Buddha with headphones to promote a bar. The religious hardliners who called for the prosecution of the trio were the same ones championing a bill to deter interfaith marriages between Buddhist and Muslims.What surprised and saddened me most was reading the online comments from some of my old friends who showed sympathy – if not outright support – for the hardliners. That convinced me that I must make clear my own positions on a variety of subjects, even if doing so put my relationship with some people in jeopardy. After all, transparency is the bedrock of reform.In the heart of downtown Yangon, glass-encased Sakura Tower overshadows Sule Pagoda’s gold-tipped spires. In teashops, cellphone-juggling teens in Mohawk cuts and skinny jeans sit next to saffron-robbed monks. The space between Myanmar’s enduring traditions and encroaching modernity is getting smaller, growing tighter. A head-on collision is inevitable. My own conscience is the battleground where the two often clash.I grew up under Ne Win’s quasi-Socialist government in the 1980s. I had always had nagging questions about the signs marking certain sections of the pagodas off-limit to women, about the jokes we told at the expense of Hindu and Muslim kids, and about the ugly caricatures of Chinese and Indian merchants that appeared in some journals and comics. But I brushed them all aside as part of the country’s social construct, its quirks that didn’t harm anybody.Perhaps they’re not so harmless. In the small opening provided by the reform, these attitudes found new outlets. The controversial monk Wirathu’s popularity remains undiminished even after he’d publicly called a UN special rapporteur a “whore”. His conduct is a reflection of the religious conservatism that sees women as less than man.Aung Myo Min, who participated in the 1988 uprising as a university student, fled to neighboring Thailand to avoid arrest. His exile abroad would last 24 years. In 2012, he finally returned home and founded the Equality Myanmar network. As an openly gay activist, I knew he had to have attracted more than his fair share of ire from the hardliners. So I reached out to him via Facebook.“I face challenges for speaking out on behalf of minority groups, such as women and LGBT,” he said. “I was attacked [in the media] several times for being LGBT and strongly supporting women’s rights, particularly against the interfaith marriage bill. I’ve received death threats on my Viber account, email and SMS.”In December 12, 2014, issue of Aung Zeyatu journal, a columnist accused Aung Myo Min of “speaking the Devil’s words”. Using a Burmese maxim, the author described Aung Myo Min as “a blind elephant stumbling through a forest”.In response Aung Myo Min remarked, “Some people interpret human rights as something that belongs to them but not to others – that is especially true of the minorities’ rights.”In 2011, after spending almost two decades behind bars, my classmate Richard Aung was freed, just days before Hillary Clinton was set to arrive. Richard is now part of the Sanchaung branch of the NLD. Two years ago, when I met him again in person, I spent a memorable evening playing guitars with him in Yangon University, pretending to be our 20-year-old selves as we serenaded the hostel students in the windows.I caught up with him on Skype last week. “Have you lost friends over your stance on religion, race, or the [religious hardliners’] Race Protection Organisation?” I asked him. He chuckled.“I have my own convictions guiding me on those, and they’re crystal clear to me,” he said. “If some people want to hate me because they disagree with me, let them. But I must say, I have never hated anybody because of their race or their religion.”“Do these topics tend to come up when you get together with classmates and old friends?” I asked.“I know some friends have strong religious views. I leave them alone and they let me be,” he said. “When we get together, we talk about old times, but avoid these sensitive topics. It’s not like we made a pledge not to talk about them, but I think people realise their sensitivity.”Richard urged me to look beyond the sectarian conflicts and see the puppet masters. “Look at the police’s show of force to respond to the student protests in Letpadan,” he said. “And look at how little effort was made to stop the violence in Meiktila [where religious riots killed dozens and displaced thousands in March 2013]. This shows you this government’s true nature.”I also tracked down the phone number for taxi-man U Aung Myint. His familiar voice came through Skype. I asked him how he felt about the reforms.“I’m not that interested in politics,” he said. “I’m just trying to make a living. I’ll respect whoever becomes president, whether it’s Daw Suu or some official from the current administration. If I can make a comfortable living, I can live with that.”I had heard of the religious hardliners campaigning to boycott the Muslims in daily commerce. In the taxi community, that would take the form of stickers bearing the sign 969, which signals to the passenger that the operator is a Buddhist. Some claim the sticker is no more than a symbol, as innocent as the image of a saint or a cross. But I imagine Muslims might see it differently, because the same three digits are prominently featured at the Race Protection Organisation’s gatherings. Both Richard Aung and U Aung Myint told me they hadn’t seen Yangon taxi drivers using the sticker as means to discriminate against passengers belonging to other faiths. Still, I had to ask.“Is there a 969 sticker on your car?” I asked, holding my breath for the answer.“No,” said U Aung Myint. “I keep a Buddha figurine in my car. People can tell I’m a Buddhist just from that. I don’t need to hang a 969 sticker.”I reminded him of the joke he made about the best way to clear up traffic in Yangon – by inviting President Obama back for another visit. Obama, in fact, did return for a second visit last November.“But in his second visit, I ran into a traffic jam,” U Aung Myint revealed. “At the 8 Mile junction, I and my foreigner passenger were stuck in traffic for 45 minutes, waiting for Obama to pass.”Myanmar is waking up from a long nightmare. The 51 million who live within it are well acquainted with the Buddhist principle of impermanence. But change is still hard. The reform brought Hillary Clinton, President Obama and Jason Mraz to the country. It also paved the way for the first LGBT film festival in Yangon; and ushered in tourists with Buddhist symbols tattooed on their limbs. Some of the country’s youth unleashed their pent-up energy during the water festival, with shorter skirts and edgier shirts each year. Some of these developments boosted the population’s morale. Others made the conservatives feel under siege.The country’s Buddhist clergy has always held a powerful sway over the population. Its role in national politics stretched back to the colonial days; and its heroism in the 2007 Saffron uprising rightfully garnered the world’s admiration. But how will it react to the separation of Church and State, a basic rule in secular government? The support enjoyed by Wirathu and the Race Protection Organisation is significant. It suggests some in the religious community are not willing to settle for a smaller role. Quite the opposite: they’re seeking to exert more influence on secular affairs.Some citizens, either out of disinterest or weariness, may drop out of the political process altogether, focusing instead on day-to-day survival like U Aung Myint. For others like my friend Richard Aung, the years they’d sacrificed behind bars was far too great an investment, so they must push ahead. Advocates like Aung Myo Min have a tough job ahead. He has to somehow explain to his countrymen that human rights are not a privilege but a responsibility.It would take many uncomfortable talks: about why women should not be relegated to the back rows in shrines that hold the relics of a being who championed kindness; about why a monk’s robe doesn’t give anyone the right to incite hatred and discrimination; about why the Muslim neighbour across the street shouldn’t be judged for the acts of the extremists in the Middle East.These are the difficult conversations we must have with our Myanmar friends, because without tackling these, the democratic reform process doesn’t stand a chance. We must have these exchanges, even at the risk of our friendship. If we don’t, we give up on the people of Myanmar.Kenneth Wong is a Myanmar-American author and blogger who grew up in Yangon.

"263",263,"Hong Kong touted as window to world trade",2015-03-27,"Business","A Hong Kong business delegation visiting Myanmar touted the special administrative region as a gateway to commerce throughout the world.           The Hong Kong Trade Development Council and assorted Myanmar and Hong Kong businesspeople met for a networking event yesterday at the Sule Shangri-La Hotel in downtown Yangon.“Mainland Chinese companies make contact with the outside world through Hong Kong. Chinese consumers see it as a window to the world,” said Stephen Liang, director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.“Myanmar companies want to go to the outside world for products and brands. I invited you to look to Hong Kong and use it as a path to do business in China, throughout Asia and the rest of the world,” he added.Mr Liang also spoke about the Council’s footprint, as it has more than 40 offices in Asia, with most in China. He said his organisation could help Myanmar companies find partnerships in Hong Kong and to identify market opportunities in Asia.The Hong Kong delegation to Yangon – the eighth of its kind – comprised 27 CEOs and other businesses leaders from a variety of industries, including financial services, logistics and trade.The trip signals Hong Kong industry’s eagerness to draw Myanmar businesses so that the developing nation will turn to Hong Kong as a gateway to international trade.U Philip, general manager of Uni Asia Company, supported the idea of participating in Hong Kong trade fairs “as a medium to go to the outside world”.“Sometimes it is very difficult to go it alone and to get trust from others,” he said. “By using the Hong Kong Trade Development Council as a conduit we can get trade partners or markets and our product will be known to others.”Trade between Myanmar and Hong Kong has grown in 2014 to reach US$227 million. Hong Kong ranked seventh on Myanmar’s list of trading partners. The island’s businesses has also invested nearly $7 billion in Myanmar.Though trade is increasing between Myanmar and Hong Kong, concerns have arisen around competition with the country’s other trading partners. Hong Kong companies of small to medium size, which often lack government backing, will have to do battle with the likes of Japan and Korea – a task they might not be up to.“Myanmar can use Hong Kong as a window to go international trade,” said Winthew Leung, director of Macrowide Group. “It has huge potential to develop, but I think Hong Kong is a little late to come to Myanmar compared with other countries like Korea and Japan.” For the most part, Myanmar trades with China, India, Japan, Indonesia, Germany and Hong Kong. Its top imports include fuel, vegetable oil, pharmaceutical products, construction equipment and machinery.This past fiscal year, foreign direct investment into Myanmar spiked to surpass $8 billion. The jump has been pinned to dynamism in energy, manufacturing and telecoms.","/business/13782-hong-kong-touted-as-window-to-world-trade.html"
"264",264,"Malaysia leads the way, again, in making a mockery of rule of law",2015-03-19,"Opinion","The problem with this region, as the former Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans restated this month, is a growing disrespect for the rule of law.          Nations that neglect to foster a reputation for integrity and decency, said Evans, endanger their own interests and jeopardise trade, tourism, foreign investment, national security and political support.More specifically, those like Cambodia, Myanmar, Singapore and Vietnam that sentence people to jail for self-serving political reasons or on frivolous religious grounds deserve all the contempt they get.In his article titled “Trashing the ASEAN Brand”, Evans took a justified and long overdue swipe at such governments and gave prominent attention to two of the worst cases: Malaysia and Thailand.It is not hard to see why, given that the duo – both founding members of ASEAN – has in the past made attempts to establish strong democratic credentials and adhere to a semblance of the rule of law.Indeed, until recently, they were regarded by many as potential beacons of hope in a region not known for integrity and decency in the administration of justice.Those beacons have now dimmed and the hope has fizzled out like a damp squib, as political survival, personal enrichment and self-aggrandisement have taken precedence over the public will.Arguably, the worst case is Thailand, where a shameful scenario continues to unfold and where the most sickening aspect is the lack of public outrage.Evans, whose capacity to fulminate has few parallels, trenchantly noted that the impeachment of former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra “on trumped-up charges” has made political reconciliation impossible.Sadly, he is almost certainly correct. There is simply no way to put lipstick on this pig and the future for Thailand remains ominous and scary.That said, an even more depressing scenario is playing out in Malaysia, which Evans tackles first in his bleak appraisal of the way the region’s ruling elites have twisted the rule of law to their own advantage.As this column noted a month ago, the long-ruling National Front coalition, led by Prime Minister Najib Razak, has been steadily sinking into a treacly pit of venality and incompetence.Some have argued that the criticism was excessive, including that made by Evans and that carried in the New York Times, which exposed the huge financial losses of a wealth fund set up by Najib’s stepson, Riza Aziz.However, it is now apparent that the barbs did not go far enough. Under Najib’s corrupt and hapless leadership matters have gone from bad to worse and the rule of law has been shamelessly flouted.Consider how the PM, fearing growing disquiet in the Malay heartland states, acquiesced to – indeed, some would say tacitly encouraged – racist taunts and actions by his more extreme UMNO colleagues.A classic example occurred earlier this month when one of his ministers urged the majority Malay community to boycott shops and businesses run by Malaysia’s Chinese minority.Cloaked in the perverse logic that it would force Chinese traders to reduce their prices and so make life easier for the Malays, this racial freakonomics drew not a whimper of protest from Najib.His craven behaviour appeared to derive from a belief that since the Chinese and Indian voters had largely deserted him in the last election, he might as well ignore them and pander to the Malay ground.In this regard, he has even deferred to Islamic chauvinists and agreed to allow UMNO to consider demands for Sharia to be introduced and to be applied to non-Muslims as well as Muslims.As for the attacks on his unexplained wealth and his shopaholic wife’s insatiable desire for expensive jewellery and handbags, the PM’s office issued a statement saying that Najib had “legacy family assets”.That sparked an astonishing and very public rebuttal from the PM’s four brothers, who said their father was “a highly principled man, well-known to all who knew him for his frugality”.In other words, he was the complete opposite of Najib and could not have left much money to his children, so it was a lie to suggest that the PM had inherited all his dough from his father.In an attempt to recoup ground, Najib called the 190 UMNO constituency heads from across the country to come to an extraordinary meeting in Kuala Lumpur on March 8 to pledge loyalty to his leadership.Unfortunately for him, 31 refused.So too did the party’s No 2, Deputy PM Muhyiddin Yassin, who is from Johor state, and Mukhriz Mahathir, the chief minister of Kedah state and a son of former PM Mahathir Mohamad, who has called on Najib to resign.Johor and Kedah are UMNO bastions and if they have turned against the PM he is on very dangerous ground.Desperate to save his skin, Najib then orchestrated another debasement of the rule of law and had Nurul Izzah Anwar, a daughter of the jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, arrested for sedition.In his censorious article, Evans had called the jailing of Anwar “a shocking and indefensible decision”, and asserted that Anwar’s real crime was to have almost defeated Najib in the previous election.Last week’s arrest of Nurul Izzah, ostensibly because – as an opposition MP – she had raised questions in parliament about the grounds for her father’s conviction, is even more shocking and indefensible.After all, sedition is defined in law as carrying out actions that are deemed to have the potential to spark violent insurrection against the established order.Is that what young Ms Nurul’s words in parliament are deemed to have done? Brought Malaysia to the brink of revolution?It is preposterous and deeply offensive, and the fact that she has now been released on bail does not make things much better.As Evans rightly intimates, if anyone has reduced Malaysia to the level where an outraged citizenry might rise up against the sordid twisting of the rule of law it is Najib and his discredited regime.","/opinion/13598-malaysia-leads-the-way-again-in-making-a-mockery-of-rule-of-law.html"
"265",265,"The political and economic challenges of Myanmar’s future",2015-03-18,"Business","For a while, when Myanmar opened after decades of isolation and sanctions, it seemed the government could do no wrong as American and European governments rushed to embrace the country. Now, according to headlines from the West, little or nothing seems right.          What was supposed to be a peaceful protest march last week over a proposed new education law turned ugly after Myanmar’s police clashed with student protesters, monks and journalists. Then there was the fierce fighting that broke out in Shan State last month between the Kokang ethnic rebels and the military, which has been prominently featured in the Western media. This follows accusations by the United Nations and others about human rights violations in the government’s dealing with the Muslim minority in Rakhine State, or Rohingya.The criticism goes beyond ethnic issues in remote states to the most central of political questions. Observers are increasingly questioning whether the year-end elections will be truly free and fair, and urge constitutional amendments to lock in democratic reform.Constitutional provisions disallow iconic opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from running for the presidency, and current government leaders and parliament are reluctant to amend them. Moreover, the military are directly represented in parliament and show little desire to reduce their role and influence.Yet, even as negative views mount, there are signs that others are betting the country will continue to open up.Investment gathering paceA key indicator is the influx of new foreign investments from the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. For instance, Myanmar’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration has approved more than US$3.71 billion of investments from more than 70 UK-based companies, which lifts Britain to the country’s fifth-largest investor.Asian neighbours have also made their moves. While Chinese companies are the front runners with over $14 billion in approved investments, Singaporean and Japanese corporates are visibly active. Last December, Keppel Land of Singapore put in $47.4 million to develop a 23-storey office tower in Yangon with Myanmar’s Shwe Taung Group. This is a new commitment from the Singapore developer which has long been an investor in Myanmar. Real estate and investment company Rowsley Limited, in which Singapore billionaire Peter Lim holds a stake, will partner a Vietnamese company to build one of Myanmar’s largest integrated projects that will have four office blocks, a retail mall, residential and serviced apartments, and a five-star hotel.Japan’s Mitsubishi Corporation will also develop another integrated project worth around $350 million in downtown Yangon, near the historic railway office. This is in partnership with Yoma Strategic Holdings, which is a Myanmar-focused, Singapore-listed corporation.Projects are advancing in other sectors too, such as oil and gas, telecommunications, and infrastructure. This is much needed, given Myanmar’s current state of development. No doubt there are challenges and questions which foreign investors want answers to. But most relate more to economic policy, rather than to ethnic problems and political issues.Priorities and paceOne of the recurring questions is about the priorities of government leaders. Besides physical infrastructure – roads, buildings, electricity – there remain gaps in the “software” of the country to facilitate investment. This includes updated and detailed laws, clear regulations and policies. Many government leaders are making every effort to move ahead, but complaints still arise about red tape further down the ranks.There is also some debate about whether the country’s economic development should rely on plentiful resources like oil and gas and forestry or gear up for industrialisation.Another major concern is finance. While the government has done well to stabilise the management of the Myanmar kyat since its opening, the country still lacks a modern financial sector that can provide capital and credit efficiently and cheaply. Cash is still king and while some large corporations have the reserves, others struggle, especially smaller and medium-sized enterprises.The government has sought to take the first step by awarding nineforeign banks the first set of foreign banking licenses to operate in Myanmar last October. These are not Western or international entities but major Asian banks – including three from Japan and two from Singapore.These banks can now lend to foreign investors and help support a second wave of foreign investors. But their licences do not allow them to offer local loans due to concerns that smaller local banks might end up getting shut out from the banking industry. Some have argued that developing the financial sector must involve both foreign and local banks. Only then can Myanmar corporations have more access to credit and other assistance to be competitive.Elections and continuityAmid this gathering economic momentum, the year-end elections bring much uncertainty.For many in Myanmar, the Lady remains immensely popular. Yet respect has grown for the effort that the current president and his administration have made. Many in the business community and among foreign investors will be keen to see continuity and stability for reforms, and hope for greater speed in the country’s progress after the elections.In contrast, others may wish the 2015 elections to deliver change. Some in the West especially expect not only free and fair voting, but that the country will emerge as a full-fledged democracy.Neither view may be correct. Judging the country’s progress purely as being about political change and democracy can be overly idealistic. But emphasising the path of business as usual may fail to recognise the needs for a more rapid and also steady reform. Myanmar’s opening was always about both political and economic challenges and their interplay will continue.Simon Tay and Cheryl Tan are, respectively, chair and assistant director of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA). On 23 March, the SIIA will hold an ASEAN-Myanmar Forum in Yangon to discuss the country’s next phase of growth.

"266",266,"Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia: Trashing the ASEAN brand",2015-03-12,"Opinion","Having a reputation for integrity and decency matters as much in international relations as in professional and personal life. States that are so regarded consistently punch above their weight – witness the Scandinavians. By contrast, those that never earn – or fritter away – such a reputation can seriously endanger their own interests, jeopardising trade, tourism, foreign investment, political support in international forums and negotiations, and the security of their own nationals abroad.          Three of Southeast Asia’s most important states – Malaysia, Thailand and now Indonesia – have brought trouble on themselves in this respect in recent months. All three are raising serious doubts, in different ways, about their commitment to the rule of law, the integrity of their judicial systems and the quality of mercy in the administration of justice.In Malaysia, the country’s highest court last month rejected opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim’s appeal against a five-year prison sentence and a ban against running for public office for a further five years – a shocking and indefensible decision. Prime Minister Najib Razak’s government was transparently vindictive in pursuing allegations of sodomy (a crime rarely prosecuted in Malaysia) against Anwar. The evidence against him was obviously inconclusive; the court’s acceptance of it was manifestly craven.If the fiction is maintained that the court was merely doing its judicial duty as it saw it, decency could still prevail: Anwar could be granted executive clemency. But there is no sign that Najib’s government will advise such action. Anwar’s real crime was that his opposition coalition of conservative Muslim, secular and Chinese parties was seriously challenging the six-decade supremacy of Najib’s United Malays National Organization (UMNO), losing the 2013 election only because of a transparent gerrymander.In Thailand, the biggest crime of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his supporters was to keep winning national elections with populist campaigns that threatened the interests of the country’s long-established Bangkok-based elite. Serious wrongdoing, involving bribery and institutional corruption, no doubt occurred along the way. But the scale of such offences could hardly justify last year’s military coup and the subsequent repression.Some of those in the army-installed National Reform Council and Constitutional Drafting Committee have a real interest in ensuring that Thailand’s next constitution – the 20th since 1932 – will be genuinely democratic. Many do want to end, once and for all, the corrupt, vote-buying culture that has long afflicted Thai politics on both sides.But true reform can be achieved only in a spirit of reconciliation and the military regime’s crude impeachment of deposed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin’s sister, in January – on trumped-up charges that seemed flimsy even to many of her diehard opponents – has made that impossible. The law, once again, has been used for nakedly political ends.Indonesia’s case is different from the other two. While less extreme, it is also troubling for the country’s reputation. The grassroots-driven victory of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo last year triumphantly consolidated the country’s democratic transition, and raised high expectations for human-rights and anti-corruption campaigners. But, domestically, confidence in Jokowi’s capacity and will to tackle corruption has eroded with his nomination – only very belatedly withdrawn – of a suspiciously wealthy but politically well-connected candidate for National Police Chief.Internationally, concern has been growing about Jokowi’s stated determination to allow – after a long moratorium – the executions of scores of convicted drug traffickers to proceed.What does not yet seem to have registered with Jokowi, or with enough of his fellow citizens, is the incongruity of refusing even to consider clemency for those on Indonesia’s death row, while lobbying passionately for clemency for more than 200 Indonesians condemned to die elsewhere, notably in the Gulf. Decency can be credibly demanded of others only if one practises it oneself.It seems only a matter of time before Indonesians start feeling the pain of this inconsistency. Malaysia has earned worldwide condemnation for its handling of the Anwar affair, and Thailand has lost many international friends since its latest coup, reflected in a humiliating loss in its recent bid for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council. Thai diplomats fear another such defeat in their country’s current attempt to win a seat on the UN Security Council.There are some larger regional consequences in all of this. ASEAN has tenaciously fought for its place as the geopolitical hinge between East and South Asia, and an important player in Asia-Pacific economic and security diplomacy. In doing so, it has had to repeatedly finesse issues like Cambodia’s authoritarian leadership, Myanmar’s struggle with democratic transition, Vietnam’s stubbornly anachronistic one-party state and even impeccably incorruptible Singapore’s regular misuse of defamation laws to neutralise political opponents.The question that ASEAN leaders must now ask themselves is just how much trashing of the Southeast Asian brand, by how many of its members simultaneously, the region can afford while still fully realising its aspirations for economic growth and political influence. It is always tempting to claim that what happens behind sovereign borders is nobody else’s business. But that is no longer true in today’s interconnected world. Some states may be big and powerful enough to get away with behaving badly, but winning respect for behaving well is a much stronger foundation for economic and political success.– Project SyndicateGareth Evans, a former Australian foreign minister (1988-1996) and past president of the International Crisis Group (2000-2009), is chancellor and honorary professorial fellow at the Australian National University.","/opinion/13469-malaysia-thailand-indonesia-trashing-the-asean-brand.html"

Representatives from 24 Chinese firms based in Tianjin in northern China visited Myanmar to study local business opportunities, though local businesspeople said it is important any investors participate in a sustainable manner.“If Chinese invest more in projects that have no effect on nature and the social environment, it would be a good thing,” said U Myo Thet, vice president of business association UMFCCI, at the March 10 event.“During last year’s visit by Chinese premier Li Keqiang to Myanmar, he insisted Chinese firms consider the environment and social impact in Myanmar.”The association also signed a memorandum of understanding with its Chinese counterpart to increase bilateral trade.UMFCCI central executive committee member U Zaw Naing Thein said the memorandum is largely concerned with ethical and responsible investment, adding it would benefit both sides to abide by the rules.Li Fuming, director of Chinese firm TJ-SADAC, said Chinese companies consider the environment and social impacts not only in Myanmar but other countries as well.China is Myanmar’s largest trading partner.","/business/13486-umfcci-urges-chinese-firms-to-act-responsibly.html"
"268",268,"How responsible are foreign investors?",2015-03-02,"Opinion","“Do you have policies and procedures in place to prevent your business activities or investment from contributing to human rights abuses and social conflict in Myanmar?”          This is one of the questions that the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, an international NGO, asked to more than 100 foreign companies investing or operating in Myanmar through a tracking project launched in November 2014. Only half of the companies approached have responded and only a quarter actually provided relevant information on their human rights policies and due diligence efforts in Myanmar.Considering that Asian companies represent the majority of foreign investors in Myanmar, we are particularly concerned that only about one-third of companies headquartered in Asia have responded. So far, for example, only one Chinese company has sent a response: Wanbao Mining. Instead of responding to the questions, however, it sent information about its corporate social responsibility activities, and environmental and social impact assessments related to its Letpadaung mine operations. Huawei, which is a supplier to major telecom operators in Myanmar, declined to respond.Too many foreign companies investing in Myanmar are not doing enough to address the risk of causing or contributing to human rights abuses. The inability of most companies to disclose their human rights commitments is worrying. Foreign companies are entering a country in transition, where their responsibilities toward people and communities are extensive, and where enhanced human rights due diligence and transparency are especially important in taking a leadership role and influencing local partners.“Foreign investment into Myanmar is essential for economic development and growth, but it cannot happen at any cost. Investors and local companies need to consider the social impacts of their joint ventures – how to minimise risks and how best to ensure that investments are sustainable in social and not just economic terms,” said John Morrison, executive director of the UK-based Institute for Human Rights and Business, one of the organisations that helped to set up the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business.Reports on how business activities in Myanmar are linked to serious rights abuses – including violence, land grabs and labour-related abuses – come out on a regular basis. Last month, Amnesty International issued a report alleging that foreign mining companies have profited from serious human rights abuses around the Monywa copper mine, which is now operated by Wanbao in partnership with Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited.Community and nationwide protests sparked by allegations of land confiscations and environmental harm led to a temporary suspension of mine operations, violence and the recent death of a protester. About 200 workers recently protested against a local subsidiary of Total due to mass terminations and low compensation.While the government is still in the process of deciding on a minimum wage, Myanmar was recently named one of the five best countries in the world for cheap labour by the Labor Costs Index. In spite of the risks of exploitative labour practices, the prospect of cheap labour will attract more investors, especially in the textile and garment sectors.These and other similar reports paint an alarming pattern of businesses being linked to serious community harms and, in the process, failing to generate the benefit and prosperity for the Myanmar people that the government claims to aspire for.“Foreign companies investing in Myanmar need to be aware that the government is failing to regulate business activities and fulfil its duty to protect human rights. Companies cannot limit themselves to respecting these inadequate national laws,” said Daniel Aguirre, the international legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists in Yangon.“Instead, they should use their influence to push the government to adopt human rights law and set a level playing field.”The glass is not only half empty. The 59 responses received to date by Business & Human Rights Resource Centre are a step forward in corporate human rights transparency. The responding companies – by both what they say and don’t say – open themselves to heightened public scrutiny and constructive discussion. Some responses set standards and provide useful guidance, raising the global bar on corporate transparency and disclosure on human rights issues.For example, Telenor and Ericsson disclosed their human rights impact assessment and their policies on privacy rights and responsible supply chain management. BG Group explained its cross-functional approach to implementing its human rights policy; Adidas and Coca-Cola detailed not only their due diligence process prior to sourcing from Myanmar but also their ongoing engagement efforts.On February 24, the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre and the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business hosted a roundtable discussion with local civil society organisations to assess the responses and discuss possible ways to keep pushing human rights issues higher up companies’ list of priorities.Transparency is an indicator of responsible business practices and a good first step, but we need to move from policies to practice and reality on the ground. This was the message from many civil society organisations leaders. There are hundreds more companies – large and small – that need to be engaged. And the more important work of checking policies against actual practice remains to be done, as companies’ human rights commitments do not necessarily reflect their actual practices.Irene Pietropaoli and Bobbie Sta Maria are researchers of Business & Human Rights Resource Centre based in Southeast Asia. All company responses received so far are available on the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre website.","/opinion/13282-how-responsible-are-foreign-investors.html"

"273",273,"Avoiding conflict with communities: An investment that pays off for mining firms",2015-02-02,"Opinion","Recent clashes at the Letpadaung copper mine that left one woman dead have pushed tensions in the area to breaking point. Neither side seems willing to make the concessions needed to end the conflict over the mine.          In light of these events, it is pertinent to ask how these types of problems can be avoided. The interests of mining firms and local populations are not always completely opposed: There is a way to negotiate mutually acceptable outcomes and although the business of understanding and negotiating with local communities is time-consuming and difficult, the philosophy is not.It is also common sense. A little investment in understanding the population who live where you work will save you a mountain of reputational and security issues in the long run. Examples from around the world show us how this process should – and often does – work.By way of slight caveat, it is worth noting that the period of the project has coincided with rapid political and economic change in Myanmar. The project was designed under the old, non-accountable system of government, and is being held to account under the new, rapidly evolving and slightly more accountable system. The Chinese operators of the project are also learning on the job: China is not a fully democratic country and does not place the same value on ordinary people having a say. In some ways it is still much like the form of government that Myanmar is moving away from.First, some background. The Letpadaung project is a joint venture between Wanbao, a Chinese firm, the military-owned Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL) and Mining Enterprise No 1 (ME1), part of the Union Ministry of Mines. The deal was originally signed between the prime ministers of China and Myanmar in April 2010 and by the end of that year the initial scoping of the project had begun near Monywa. Wanbao operates the project on the ground.During 2011, land compensation was paid to villagers who were to be moved from their villages to make way for the project. This, however, was based on Wanbao’s assessment of the land value, and was administered by township officials, who reportedly forced villagers to sign or thumbprint a “contract” without allowing them to see the document’s contents. They were then allegedly further short-changed on the “agreed” compensation amount as well, with some K5000 notes swapped for K500 notes.After a series of altercations between township officials and villagers – including arrests of protesters and replacement of anti-project village leaders – some decided to relocate.Others opted to remain in their homes, unwilling to accept the amount of compensation forced upon them.Construction work on the mine started in March 2012 but was stopped in June that year due to civil unrest in the area. To date, it hasn’t restarted.Wanbao then employed an international consulting firm to conduct an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). Whether this was because ESIAs had been mandated for mining projects in the 2012 Environmental Conservation Law is not known. While the ESIA was supposed to have been based on international standards, the firm that conducted the assessment admitted in its report that these were impossible to achieve in the circumstances surrounding the project.For example, the study was conducted after the project had started and people had been moved from their land. The government limited the villages that the study was allowed to talk to. The use of Wanbao interpreters and the presence of undercover government officials – who sometimes videotaped consultations with villages – limited freedom of expression. These, as well as other issues, made it difficult for affected villagers to give what is known in the industry as free, prior and informed consent.The ESIA continued over the next 18 months, with Wanbao submitting a draft to the Myanmar government in December 2013. The delay was partly due to major civil unrest: In November 2012, police used white phosphorous grenades on protesting villagers and monks, some of whom suffered severe burns as a result.In the meantime, President U Thein Sein appointed Daw Aung San Suu Kyi head of a special commission charged with investigating the project. The commission’s report was released in March 2013 and recommended increases in land compensation (a total of US$8 million has been paid to 441 landowners to date) as well as improved environmental and social protections. Wanbao began a series of relatively extensive corporate social responsibility programs that delivered schools, roads, electricity connections, water purification facilities and pagodas to affected communities.In July 2013, amendments to the production sharing contract between Wanbao, the Myanmar government, MEHL and ME1 were made that decreased Wanbao’s profits and increased the Myanmar government’s.ME1 and MEHL, which is owned by the Tatmadaw – an organisation notorious for land rights violations – were made responsible for all consultations with the community and land acquisitions.In early 2014, the ESIA continued with the same Western consulting firm beginning a further community consultation exercise. It found that the most important issues were compensation for land acquisition, followed by concerns over the environmental impact of mining, and opportunities for community development and employment.The current issues surrounding the project are well known and culminated with the killing of Daw Khin Win on December 22. She was shot while attending a protest against the erection of a fence around land claimed by both the company and the local communities.The relationship between Wanbao and at least some of the surrounding communities has completely broken down. Tensions are inflamed on all sides and there is no trust. This means that even when reasonable points are made by the communities or reasonable offers are made by the project operators, they are rejected out of hand. We are in a situation where outside activists are involved, a villager has been shot, other villagers have been attacked with white phosphorous grenades and relations between the Chinese and Myanmar governments are being affected.So how should this process work?It is not difficult – but it is time-consuming and involves putting more money and effort in at the beginning of a project life-cycle. However, this is repaid several-fold in terms of company reputation, security of the worksite and the absence of work stoppages.Simply, as soon as a project deal is signed, operators have to launch their ESIA, as legally required. This is the company’s opportunity to understand the communities in the area and their concerns. Generally this is part of the assessment, although the “social” usually plays second fiddle to the “environmental”. This is because social impacts are usually much more complex than environmental impacts. They are more difficult to understand because rather than measuring environmental variables they involve taking the views of lots of people into account.Companies should launch their local community consultation with a heavy emphasis on understanding the community and building durable links with them based on trust. There is logic behind the immediate commencement of community consultations. Rumours about the project will already be in full flow, causing, for example, land prices to fluctuate – either up or down depending on the rumours – and resulting in people moving into the area in anticipation of work. In short, social impacts start well before environmental impacts.Open interaction will improve the operator’s understanding of the community but also the community’s understanding of the operator. Discussions will then naturally focus on how the community and the operator can work together. The possible interactions between the two are extensive, but include employment, training, social development and any possible land resettlements. It is to be expected that the project will cause significant impositions on the community but it is also to be expected that the communities will foresee benefit through increased opportunities for employment, training and up-skilling, and education. It is, after all, the local communities’ project as well.Following on from this process, and based on the outcomes of the ESIA and engagement process, corporations enact their corporate social responsibility programs – essentially what they are going to do for communities in return for them allowing the corporation to operate in the area. This ensures that communities receive what they want and need, rather than what the company thinks that they should have.Of utmost importance is that the community feels part of any CSR projects that will be implemented. If they are not, there will be very little impact in terms of increasing goodwill.In reality, the ESIA and the CSR programs are one and the same: They are about understanding and working with the population and environment. Often they come under different budgetary lines but wise companies organise them using the same people and pay for them under the same budget.Get it right and the company enjoys good relations with its communities – and hence its workforce and contractors, most of whom will come from those communities – as well as fewer work stoppages and less security issues. Security is generated by the communities having a psychological stake in the project, not by guards keeping the communities away from the project. The opposite – having to pause the project while the population protests against you – costs companies much more than doing it properly in the first place. The costs to Wanbao to date must be astronomical – both to its reputation and bottom line.Finally, the outcome of the extensive two-way discussions should be enshrined in a social covenant signed between the operator, the communities and the government before any physical construction begins on site. This will set out the responsibilities of the company to the communities and vice versa: The corporate social responsibility program will then be grounded in what the community actually wants. Sensible companies also build in grievance mechanisms, so that both the communities and the company can communicate in a way that minimises tensions. Get this right and the mutual outcomes are considerable.Myanmar is a country that is “blessed” with natural resources. Dozens of extractive projects are already under way; within a few years there will be hundreds. The revenues that will accrue from these resources could fund the development of Myanmar and lift millions of its people out of poverty. But accusations of land grabs, human rights abuses and allegations of government complicity in both will scare away investors and responsible operators. Corporations must get on top of this. It is not enough to say that the Myanmar government is “handling these issues for us”. If a corporation says this, it is its reputation that will inevitably suffer.As a friend of mine working in mining investment remarked recently, “Not for 15 years will the reputational risk be acceptable [in Myanmar], and by then the Chinese will have taken all the good stuff.”Mike Martin is director of IDG Acumen, a micro-social research consultancy with an expertise in conflict and security that is based in Yangon.

"274",274,"Wanbao must stick to its commitments",2015-02-02,"Opinion","Many are questioning whether anyone will be held accountable for the killing of Daw Khin Win, who was shot during a December 22 protest near the Letpadaung copper mine. But what are the responsibilities of the mine’s investors in relation to the dispute?          The Letpadaung mine is a joint venture between Chinese company Wanbao and the military-owned Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited. The mine operator, Myanmar Wanbao, has made a public commitment to sustainable development and human rights in the final draft of its comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), which was released on 25 June 2014. According to the company’s website, the Letpadaung project “will play as a role model in environmental conservation sector of the Union of Myanmar”.But what kind of role model for responsible investment will Letpadaung really be? The answer will provide vital clues to the direction of Myanmar’s economic development, and whether the unlocking of the country’s enormous resources improves the lives of millions of people or prompts another “resource curse” – whereby powerful political and economic actors scramble for wealth over the backs of ordinary people.Residents of Monywa, some 100 kilometres west of Mandalay, have complained for years about unlawful land confiscations and environmental damage caused by the mine’s operations. In November 2012, dozens of protesters were severely burned when riot police allegedly used white phosphorous.One indicator of Wanbao’s commitment to responsible conduct is how it responds to Daw Khin Win’s killing and the protests over the mine’s operation. Daw Khin Win was killed on December 22, when she and other residents tried to stop Wanbao workers from fencing off their land for development. The protesters faced company security as well as local police.An initial investigation by the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission ruled that the police were responsible for the shooting and recommended legal action. So far, however, the authorities have been reluctant to investigate. Instead, they have prosecuted protesters demanding justice for Daw Khin Win. But the state’s failure to protect human rights does not absolve the company of all responsibility, however.Myanmar Wanbao promised that it would not come to this. The company’s ESIA outlines its commitment to local laws as well as international standards on law enforcement in securing its operations. In the assessment, the company agreed to develop a security plan in order to prevent or mitigate any threats identified in its risk assessment. “The objective of the security plan will be to ensure that security is deployed in a way that respects and protects human dignity and human rights, avoids creating conflict and addresses security threats in as peaceful a way as possible,” it said.The agreement’s social management plan goes into detail on Wanbao’s responsibility in a section on “security and the use of force”. The company has committed, in line with international standards, to ensuring that force is used only as a last resort where necessary to proportionately mitigate risks identified in the company’s risk assessment. They have agreed to provide the necessary training for security in this regard.The company has acknowledged the concerns associated with project security in weak governance zones. Its ESIA states that government security services protecting its operations must respect international guidelines on the use of force. Wanbao also committed to conducting due diligence on all security providers in order “to avoid retaining the services of any group or individual that has previously been responsible for violations of human rights or humanitarian law”. These are important preventative measures for any company operating in Myanmar, where the rule of law and human rights are not well developed.Wanbao has repeatedly claimed that it has gone beyond its legal requirements. “Even though Myanmar Wanbao has met its legal requirements and has paid compensation and subsidies, the company has gone further to safeguard the livelihood and well-being of its community,” it says.Given the continued allegations of human rights abuse at the Letpadaung mine, it is important for Wanbao to demonstrate that it has conducted due diligence and undertaken the remedial measures outlined in its ESIA. Wanbao should make public its risk assessment and its security plan to avoid being perceived as complicit in human rights abuses. Its ESIA demands that a full report is submitted to its office if a firearm is discharged, as it was during the December 22 protest at which Daw Khin Win was killed. This report should be made public.Now that human rights abuses related to security and the use of force have occurred, the company should make good on its commitment to create an effective community complaints mechanism. The ESIA explains that this mechanism would allow the community to express concerns about security. It also states that Wanbao will investigate allegations raised and take action to prevent their reoccurrence. It is vital that Wanbao be seen as implementing its own rules and helping the local community come to terms with recent events.The establishment of this mechanism is important in Myanmar, where the police and judiciary are often unwilling or unable to address these issues. This has certainly been the case so far with the killing of Daw Khin Win.Wanbao should work closely with civil society to improve its relations with the local community and ensure respect for their rights. It should immediately implement the terms of its ESIA. If it has done so, Wanbao should make this public and explain why events unfolded in a manner that has led to accusations of human rights abuses.The latest violence at Letpadaung shows that the government needs to carefully monitor the implementation of ESIAs to ensure that they represent meaningful commitments and not just exercises in public relations.Daniel Aguirre is the international legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists in Yangon.

"275",275,"$1 billion local investment in  pipeline",2015-02-02,"Business","Myanmar has invested US$1.204 billion in the China-Myanmar Crude Oil Project in keeping with its 49 percent stake in the project, according to officials.The total project has cost $2.4532 billion to switch on, with the other half of the funding coming from state-owned China Petroleum Corporation, which owns 50.9pc. Myanmar state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise owns the rest.“The major constructions of the crude oil pipeline were completed in early 2015,” said U Nyan Tun, vice president and chair of the National Energy Management Committee.He was speaking during a launch at Yangon’s Inya Lake Hotel on January 28 officially closed to Myanmar private-sector media. However, The Myanmar Times was able to secure a recording of the presentations.The January 28 ceremony marked the soft opening of the pipeline itself as well as the crude oil unloading terminal on Made island in Rakhine State. Made island is one terminus on the controversial pipeline, which then works through Myanmar before ending at another terminus in southern China’s Yunnan province.The aim of the pipeline is to make it easier to ship oil to China from the Middle East and Africa, as currently it must be shipped by oil tanker through the Straits of Malacca past Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.U Nyan Tun said the project provided $13.26 million for corporate social responsibility programs, as well as contributing employment opportunities and building the country’s economy.A 300,000-ton crude oil tanker docked at Made deep seaport last week to fuel a test-run of the pipeline. It is designed to transmit 22 million tonnes of crude annually.There will be five processing stations on the 771-kilometre (479 -mile) long pipeline, according to a press statement from the South East Asia Crude Oil Pipeline Company (SEAOP), which is the company created by China National Petroleum Corporation and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise to manage the pipeline.Made Island is a vast project site including oil storage, a dockyard and seaport that can be used to offload crude for transport through the pipeline to Yunnan in China, according to a press release.SEAOP touted Made Island seaport as Myanmar’s first international oil unloading terminal, being 480 metres in length and able to dock vessels with 300,000 tonnes of capacity. There are also 12 oil storage tanks with capacity of 22 million gallons (83 million litres) each.“This project will promote our country’s economy and development in the area the pipeline crosses,” said U Nyan Tun.A twin natural gas pipeline entered full operation last year with investment from a consortium of Chinese, Myanmar, Indian and Korean firms. So far it has pumped a total of 3.92 billion cubic metres of natural gas to China and 147 million cubic metres for domestic supply.So far it has been running under capacity. It is declared to be capable of transmitting 12 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year, with plans originally calling for an initial capacity of 5.2 billion cub metres in the first phase of its operations. Myanmar was to receive 2.5 billion cubic metres for domestic use.Myanmar stands to generate annual revenue from both the natural gas and crude oil pipelines, though so far it has been unclear by how much.The deal between China National Petroleum Corporation and the Myanmar government on the crude oil pipeline was first inked in 2008. Full-scale construction began in 2011, and full operation is expected to start in mid-2015.Pipeline ceremony closed to local mediaChinese and Myanmar state media was invited to the pipeline launch in Yangon, but Myanmar private media was kept out.Officials have speculated it was a high-level decision made by senior government officials following controversy over other Chinese-funded projects in Myanmar.Myanmar and Chinese authorities did not invite local media to the events which were held in Yangon on January 28 and Made Island on January 30.The Myanmar Times was able to acquire a recording of the presentations from the Yangon event, which was held at the Inya Lake Hotel.A SEAOP official told The Myanmar Times before the event that media invitations would be carried out by the Ministry of Energy. So far the ministry has not officially explained why the ceremony was held in secret, with only a few, mostly government officials allowed to attend.“It is likely because of recent protests on Chinese projects in the country,” said one official from the Ministry of Energy, who requested anonymity. “Maybe the Union minister or others in cabinet are trying to keep it silent.”","/business/12996-1-billion-local-investment-in-pipeline.html"
"276",276,"Blame game at Letpadaung",2015-01-28,"Opinion","Many are questioning whether anyone be held accountable for the killing of Daw Khin Win, who was shot during a protest against the Letpadaung copper mine.          But what are the responsibilities of the mine’s investors in relation to the dispute? The Letpadaung mine is a joint venture between Chinese company Wanbao and the military-owned Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited.The mine operator, Myanmar Wanbao, has made a public commitment to sustainable development and human rights inthe final draft of its comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), which was released on 25 June 2014. According to the company’s website, the Letpadaung project “will play as a role model in environmental conservation sector of the Union of Myanmar”.But what kind of role model for responsible investment will Letpadaung really be? The answer will provide vital clues to the direction of Myanmar’s economic development, and whether the unlocking of the country’s enormous resources improvesthe lives of millions of people or prompts another “resource curse” – whereby powerful political and economic actors scramble for wealth over the backs of ordinary people.Residents of Monywa, some 100 kilometres west of Mandalay, have complained for years about unlawful land confiscations and environmental damage caused by the mine’s operations. In November 2012, dozens of protesters, including monks, were severely burned when riot police allegedly used white phosphorous.One indicator of Wanbao’s commitment to responsible conduct is how it responds to Daw Khin Win’s killing and the protests over the mine’s operation. Daw Khin Win was killed on December 22, whenshe and other residents tried to stop Wanbao workers from fencing off their land for development. The protesters faced company security as well as localpolice.Aninitial investigation by the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission ruled that the police were responsible for the shooting and recommended legal action. So far, however, the authoritieshave been reluctant to investigate. Instead, they have prosecuted protesters demanding justice for Daw Khin Win. But the state’s failure to protect human rights does not absolve the company of all responsibility, however. Myanmar Wanbao promised that it would not come to this. The company’s ESIA outlines its commitment to local laws as well as international standards on law enforcement in securing its operations. In the assessment, the company agreed to develop a security plan in order to prevent or mitigate any threats identified in its risk assessment. “The objective of the security plan will be to ensure that security is deployed in a way that respects and protects human dignity and human rights, avoids creating conflict and addresses security threats in as peaceful a way as possible,” Wanbao said.The agreement’ssocial management plan goes into detail on Wanbao’s responsibility in a section on “security and the use of force”. The company has committed, in line with international standards, to ensuring that force is used only as a last resort where necessary to proportionately mitigate risks identified in the company’s risk assessment. They have agreed to provide the necessary training for security in this regard.The company has acknowledged the concerns associated with project security in weak governance zones. Its ESIA states that government security services protecting its operations must respect international guidelines on the use of force. Wanbao also committed to conducting due diligence on all security providers in order “to avoid retaining the services of any group or individual that has previously been responsible for violations of human rights or humanitarian law”.These are important preventative measures for any company operating in Myanmar, where the rule of law and human rights are not well developed.Wanbao has repeatedly claimed that it has gone beyond its legal requirements. “Even though Myanmar Wanbao has met its legal requirements and has paid compensation and subsidies, the company has gone further to safeguard the livelihood and well-being of its community,” it says.Given the continued allegations of human rights abuse at the Letpadaung mine, it is important for Wanbao to demonstrate that it has conducted due diligence and undertaken the remedial measuresoutlined in its ESIA.

The case is the latest wrinkle in relations between Myanmar and China, which has continued to assert its growing economic clout in the Southeast Asian country even as some Chinese-led projects have sparked fierce local opposition.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said a joint working group met each of the 155 detainees separately this week and ""confirmed that they were in good physical and spiritual condition"".She did not provide any details regarding the date or circumstances of their detention.A report by China's official Xinhua news agency said a Chinese consular working group met detainees on Monday in Myitkyina, the capital of northern Myanmar's Kachin state.Myanmar presidential office spokesman Zaw Htay confirmed Chinese nationals had been arrested in Kachin but did not specify how many.""It's true that we have arrested some Chinese nationals. We will review them in line with immigration acts and forestry laws, then will take action,"" he told AFP.Earlier this week China's state-run Global Times newspaper reported that ""about 2,000 local residents, including hundreds of Chinese citizens"" had been trapped amid fighting between Myanmar troops and the rebel Kachin Independence Army.But Hua on Wednesday dismissed that report as baseless.""According to information we get from the Myanmar side, we haven't found any Chinese people trapped in north Myanmar,"" she said, adding that Chinese authorities ""hope that relevant media can respect facts and report objectively"".China has been ramping up its investment in neighbouring Myanmar, with the two signing a series of agreements in November worth $7.8 billion.Yet relations have at time been roiled by intense local opposition to Chinese projects.Last month a woman protesting a controversial Chinese-backed copper mine was shot dead by police.The mine has triggered fierce opposition from local villagers due to alleged land grabs and environmental damage, with one recent protest near the Chinese consulate in Mandalay drawing around 500 people.Such disputes have raised questions about Myanmar's reliance on investment from China, which gave crucial political support to the former junta.","/national-news/12868-china-confirms-nationals-detained-in-myanmar.html"

Police are now prosecuting six people arrested in Yangon in protests last month against the mine venture in the central town of Monywa, which has been dogged by complaints of land-grabbing and environmental damage.""Six people are now charged and police are looking for evidence against two others,"" lawyer Robert San Aung told AFP after a hearing in Yangon's Dagon township.Small but regular demonstrations have been held in recent weeks outside the Chinese embassy in Yangon and its consulate in Mandalay following the fatal shooting last month of a female protester near the Letpadaung mine.Khin Win, in her 50s, was killed on December 22 when police opened fire on protesters trying to stop the mine company building a fence in territory disputed with local farmers.Four of the Yangon protesters, who have been held in the city's notorious Insein prison since late December, had already been charged.The mine -- run by Chinese firm Wanbao as part of a joint venture with a major local military conglomerate --- has raised questions about Myanmar's reliance on investment from neighbouring China, which gave crucial political support to the former junta.A new quasi-civilian government has implemented major reforms in recent years, including releasing political prisoners and allowing opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi into parliament.But land disputes and battles for the nation's rich mineral resources are posing an increasingly serious challenge.Protesting without police permission is still forbidden. Most of those arrested during demonstrations are charged under Section 18 of Myanmar's criminal code, which carries a maximum one-year sentence.But lawyer Robert San Aung said the six anti-Letpadaung protesters have instead been charged with more serious public order offences, including obstructing police and ""harming the image of the nation"".""The charges are disproportionate.

"279",279,"Pressure builds on Letpadaung committee",2015-01-12,"National News","Activists have attacked a parliamentary report that criticises them for whipping up hostility among local villagers to the Letpadaung copper mine project. Clashes over the project, which has been accused of grabbing farmland and damaging the environment, have left at least one person dead and scores injured in recent years.          Violence broke out again on December 22, when villager Daw Khin Win was killed and several demonstrators wounded during a further protest at the copper mine as police opened fire on demonstrators. The protest had been launched to stop the mining company from building a fence in territory disputed with local farmers.The killing prompted hundreds of people to demonstrate in Yangon and Mandalay outside the Chinese embassy and consulate, while further demonstrations took place in Monywa last week (see related story left).At the peak of the unrest, National League for Democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi criticised the government for failing to properly implement the findings of the commission she headed in 2013.However, the Letpadaung Report Implementation Committee rejected the accusations, saying in a January 6 report that activists were to blame for inciting violence “behind the curtain”.“We have already charged those who are trying to stimulate the conflict,” U Tin Myint, secretary of the implementing committee, told reporters on January 8 at the President’s Office.He also defended the committee’s work, saying that 29 of 42 recommendations had already been implemented and others were in process. “We carried out the commission’s recommendations as well as we could, if not 100 percent.”However, he added that the committee would take into account criticisms of the project provided they are voiced according to the law.“We will listen with respect to the demands of local people and try to fulfill them as much as we can so there is no repeat of this violence,” he said.Letpadaung residents and activists alike rejected the committee’s accusations, claiming the root problem is a lack of transparency about the mine project and the implementation committee’s activities.U Tun Myint Aung from the 88 Generation Peace and Open Society said the government should invite stakeholders for discussions to find a solution to the conflict rather than blame others for the unrest.“The committee’s accusations are ridiculous. It is the same kind of accusation that we have always heard from the military government.”Activists also blamed the refusal of the mine’s investors to negotiate the amount of compensation.“The main point is the company’s lack of willingness to negotiate,” said U Chit Khin, a Monywa resident who leads the Save Letpadaung Mountain Committee.The copper mine project is a joint project between army-owned Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Chinese company Wanbao, a subsidiary of arms manufacturer Norinco.Wanbao spokesperson Dong Yunfei last week called for immediate government action against the activists who he said had egged the villagers on. “Every foreign investment in this country has faced criticism, whether it is from Japan, Thailand or China. It’s important to avoid inflaming the situation for political gain,” he said.But Daw Khin San Hlaing, an NLD MP who sat on the Letpadaung Investigation Commission, said the company was responsible for the unrest. She also called for the immediate dissolution of the implementing committee.“The problems at Letpadaung will not be resolved as long as Wanbao makes no effort to win trust locally and the government can offer no solutions,” she said.The implementation committee says adequate compensation was paid for the 6784 acres of land confiscated, with more than K10 billion paid out to the former owners.","/national-news/12781-pressure-builds-on-letpadaung-committee.html"
"280",280,"Myanmar Oriental Bank aims to improve with IFC support",2015-01-05,"Business","The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is looking to strengthen its partnership with Myanmar Oriental Bank, according to the bank’s chair U Mya Than.           Although foreign institutions are currently forbidden from owning any part of domestic banks, many expect the laws to change to allow more foreign participation. In the meantime, Myanmar Oriental and the IFC are discussing a convertible loan that could allow the IFC to take an equity stake in the firm.“We are discussing equity participation in MOB, and have made good progress, to an extent,” he said.Myanmar Oriental Bank has been running for more than 20 years, being one of the first, along with banks like First Private Bank, Myanmar Citizens Bank and Co-operative Bank, to open their doors following a change in government policy toward private banks in the early 1990s.U Mya Than said there was a huge gap between what Myanmar businesses required and what state banks were able to provide when Myanmar Oriental Bank set up in 1993. As one of the first private banks that emerged in the early 1990s, it aimed to help fill these holes in the market.The bank has connections with the local Chinese community. Its founding family has Chinese roots, and connections with other businesspeople in Asian countries such as China, Taiwan and Singapore, with corresponding banking agreements.There are a total of 25 shareholders in the bank, from various backgrounds. U Mya Than himself was an employee of state-owned Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank before joining the private sector.Established in 1993, Myanmar Oriental has shared the tumultous history of the banking sector in general.In 2003, several large Myanmar banks failed in a banking crisis. However, Myanmar Oriental recovered to continue operations. Now with over two decades of experience, it has 26 branches – more than some, but less than KBZ, the market leader, which has over 150 across the country.U Mya Than said Myanmar Oriental has decided to focus on areas like internet banking and treasuries trading when it becomes available rather than simply adding more branches. It also has made a commitment to ensure 95 percent of financing goes to small and medium enterprises.“Widening branch networks is a very traditional way of doing business. Domestic banks normally have offered the same products and compete with each other in markets that are smaller than their dignity, but this habit will change,” said U Mya Than.Myanmar Oriental is aiming for a wide customer base, and also looking to perform more international banking functions, he said.U Mya Than added that while the Central Bank of Myanmar has eased some restrictions on banking, commercial banks need to upgrade their capabilities while the Central Bank needs to improve from a regulatory standpoint.The agreement with the IFC is to be partly aimed at improving Myanmar Oriental’s capabilities.The IFC has already signed a deal for a US$5 million convertible loan with Yoma Bank in September, plus an agreement to improve its risk management and corporate governance.In February, Myanmar Oriental and the IFC signed an agreement for a $5 million trade finance facility, aiming to assist local companies increase their imports and exports.U Mya Than said the IFC also provides guarantees for Myanmar Oriental’s letters of credit used in trade financing, as well as assisting with corporate governance and risk management processes.","/business/12722-myanmar-oriental-bank-aims-to-improve-with-ifc-support.html"
"281",281,"Private investment to spark electricity boom ",2015-01-05,"Business","Poor power supply continues to plague Myanmar.           Most estimates claim less than one-third of the country’s population has regular access to electricity, and those that do still experience frequent power cuts. Businesses have difficulty operating with uncertain power supply – generators are expensive, and downtime translates directly to lost revenue for too many companies.Effort is clearly being made to tackle the gargantuan task of righting the domestic electricity industry. Several important steps were made in 2014 to improve generation, transmission and distribution capacity.Importantly, the long-delayed electricity law was finally passed last year, and the Ministry of Electric Power is now working on the detailed rules and regulations that are to follow. These regulations can provide a solid foundation to improve electrification, but much more needs to be done.The government is attempting to address the energy shortfalls, though financing the necessary expensive projects continues to be a major problem. Most domestic power projects are currently carried out through funding from the state budget and international loans, and increased foreign investment provides an attractive conduit to improve domestic energy infrastructure.At the moment, though, foreign investment is largely confined to several high-profile generation efforts.Nowhere is foreign involvement more controversial than in hydropower. The large-scale Myitsone dam project was frozen by Presidential order in 2011 following public opposition. In 2014, officials from the Ministry of Electric Power have said they would like to see more Western involvement in hydropower, though Chinese investment was the industry’s largest driver during the last years of the military government.Hydropower still produces the majority of the country’s electricity. A swath of agreements to establish some 60 hydro projects – some fanciful and others much more realistic – were signed during the military government era, mostly with Chinese firms as well as other companies from areas like India and Thailand.More than half of those 60 projects are still to be implemented, with some put on hold and others likely to proceed.Ministry of Electric Power deputy minister U Maw Thar Htwe has said the government is now only working with companies of an international standard with reliable quality and financing.“The trend in hydropower project implementation is to turn to Western companies,” he said.A number of Western firms have signed up for domestic hydro projects. Shweli (3) is to be implemented by English and French companies, the Middle Yeywar and Bawgata projects with Norwegian firms and the Middle Paung Laung project by Austrian or English projects. At least four hydro projects signed with Chinese and Thai companies have been delayed due to public opposition.Coal generating projects also faced public opposition in 2014, with complaints often targeted at their environmental footprint. Some were cancelled and others were delayed, though a few are on track. Coal-fired projects may not be environmentally friendly, but they are generally easy to build and provide cheap electricity – particularly compared to gas.While efforts to generate electricity from natural gas have not attracted quite the amount of controversy as coal and hydro, gas plants are also often more challenging.“What’s happening right now is that gas-fired power plants have become expensive, and people don’t want to accept hydro and coal,” said U Khin Maung Win, director general of the Department of Electric Power. “We don’t have any other options – but we want positive suggestions.”“We are in a very tight corner to implement these power projects,” he added. Although often more expensive, there has been significant foreign interest in Myanmar gas-fired power projects.Companies from countries like the US, Hong Kong and Korea have won or are competing for tenders.In 2014, American firm APR Energy won an industry award for its Kyaukse project, while Hong Kong’s V Power won a tender for a gas-fired plant for the Kyaukphyu special economic zone. A gas-powered plant was also set up in Thaketa in 2013 by a Singaporean firm.While efforts to attract foreign interest in gas-fired plants appear to be bearing the most fruit, Myanmar is also experimenting with green technologies.Agreements to develop solar power projects near Mandalay and Magwe regions were signed in 2014.Still, U Khin Maung Win said it is Rakhine State which was perhaps the most significant step for Myanmar’s electrification efforts last year.“The most exciting news in 2014 is lighting up Rakhine State, where it’s been very hard to get electricity. This is a real milestone for us,” he said. “We are also now working on power transmission to Hakha in Chin State, a very remote area.”“These projects are not necessarily profitable from a business standpoint but are important for regional development,” he added.Transmission, getting power from power plants to sub-stations, and distribution, getting power from sub-stations to homes, are equally important to generation efforts. After all, enough power can be generated, but if it doesn’t get to Myanmar’s homes, the country will still be in the dark.These areas have been slower in attracting foreign investment. So far there has been minimal involvement from foreign, private enterprises, but foreign development agencies have been stepping up to the plate.The Export-Import Bank of Korea and Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise signed a US$100 million deal to establish the 500-kilovolt Taungoo-Kamanat transmission project. Meanwhile, the World Bank Group and the Japanese government have also announced plans to support Yangon with upgrading its electricity distribution system.All these changes offer large potential rewards, but the ultimate judge will be the end user.Consumers will be paying the price for upgrades – electricity rates increased by 40 percent in 2014. The government has not yet released figures indicating how much revenue the move generated for state coffers, despite several requests from The Myanmar Times.Last year also saw several steps not taken. Officials were coy on potential privatisation of Yangon Electricity Supply Board, claiming there are no immediate plans to allow private equity participation in the board, which governs distribution in Yangon, home to about half the country’s electricity consumption.On the whole, steps were taken in 2014 to address electrification, one of Myanmar’s most pressing issues. Much more needs to be done in 2015 if the issue is to be solved.","/business/12723-private-investment-to-spark-electricity-boom.html"

"284",284,"Myanmar’s far north: The final frontier",2014-12-22,"Lifestyle","Responsible tourism – largely focusing on environmental protection, community involvement, poverty alleviation and balanced management of both natural and cultural heritage – can be a powerful tool for sustainable development if travellers and operators make informed choices.           This is perhaps more crucial in Myanmar than anywhere else in the world. Myanmar’s place as a “latecomer” in the global tourist market is a historic chance for the country. Learning from the successes and failures of established tourist destinations, the country has an opportunity to avoid making many of the same mistakes.Rich in natural resources, fauna and flora, Kachin State – Myanmar’s northernmost territory – offers fantastic biodiversity and huge nature-based eco-tourism opportunities. Although the state’s capital city, Myitkyina, presents no particular charm, Indawgyi Lake to the south and Putao to the north provide good examples of eco-tourism initiatives that have the potential for national scale expansion.Environmental experts have recently warned that Shan State’s iconic Inle Lake could disappear within a century due to overexploitation by the tourism industry if conservation efforts are not dramatically scaled up. By contrast, a community-based eco-tourism project was launched in June at Indawgyi Lake, securing its status as a birdwatcher’s paradise.Myanmar’s largest natural lake and one of the largest inland lakes in Southeast Asia, Indawgyi Lake is a fragile wetland eco-system. Indawgyi Lake Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1999 over a total area of around 780 square kilometres (300 square miles). Extraordinary rich birdlife – including several species of gulls, geese, ducks, kingfishers, cranes, watercocks, darters, egrets, herons, ibis and pelicans – can be seen, most of which are protected by Myanmar law. Elephants, tigers, leopards, bears and gaurs are also protected by the sanctuary.In an announcement last June, Flora and Fauna International (FFI) – the world’s first international conservation organisation – along with Myanmar’s Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry, and the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism, said, “Creating a responsible, sustainable tourism strategy that involved and engaged local communities could prevent mistakes that have been made during the development of other regions – including Inle Lake – that can lead to serious environmental degradation.“This program can help to support everyone who lives here and is a good example for other communities in the country,” Deputy Minister for Hotels and Tourism Sai Kyaw Ohne added. Last year, FFI created a community group that goes by the name of Inn Chit Thu, or Lovers of Indawgyi. The group aims to support local livelihoods through the development of eco-tourism. Village youths were trained in eco-tourist practices and provided with kayaks and mountain bikes to rent to tourists who want to explore the lake and its surrounding forests.While the lake is visited by both local and foreign tourists, the number of visitors – though increasing – remains small.“Indawgyi Lake is still in a pristine state with thousands of migratory birds arriving each winter from Siberia, turning the lake into a heaven for birdwatchers and nature tourists,” a FFI spokesperson said.Surrounded by snow-capped mountains, Putao – in the north – makes a fantastic base for trekking. In addition to Myanmar’s highest mountain, Hkakabo Razi, travellers can explore Putao’s forested canyons and pristine waterfalls.Remote and unspoiled, Putao remains one of the least explored regions of Myanmar and is virtually untouched by modern development. Several threatened species of mammals have been recorded there such as the red panda and the Asiatic black bear. High levels of endemism have earned it recognition as a conservation hotspot and an outstanding global eco-region.A modest Environment Educational Center was set up in Putao in 1993 by the Wildlife Conservation Society, an American science-based NGO. Research conducted by the centre has led to the discovery of several new species of wildlife and plants in the region.However, several dark clouds continue to cast a shadow over this remote idyll.Despite attempts to bring peace to the region, the long-standing conflict that has ravaged Kachin State continues. A new outbreak of violence between the Kachin Independence Army and the Myanmar military erupted in 2011.In addition, despite being home to the majority of Myanmar’s jade mines, this precious resource has only added to the region’s woes. Experts estimate that the country hosts the world’s largest and most valuable jade mines, and most of the jade stones extracted in Myanmar come from Kachin State. The boom in Myanmar’s jade industry is linked to an insatiable demand for precious stones among the ever-growing Chinese middle class.Locally, the industry has had an enormously harmful impact – misery, violence, corruption and heroin addiction. Military checkpoints strictly control the road leading to the heavily protected mines, where the conditions of those involved in extraction are reported to be extremely harsh.The construction of a huge hydroelectric dam in Myitsone has also brought controversy. Myanmar’s former military government signed an agreement in 2006 with the China Power Investment Cooperation (CPIC) to build the dam. When completed it will measure 152 metres (around 500 feet) high and the total electricity produced will be sold to China, with no benefit to Myanmar citizens. In addition, the dam’s construction will displace around 15000 people and submerge dozens of villages.Despite these serious causes for concern, the recent creation of a national-level tourism committee, whose first meeting was held last April in Nay Pyi Taw, is a hopeful new step for the country. The tourism sector is designated as a priority in Myanmar’s national export strategy, and tourist arrivals in Myanmar increased to 2.04 million in 2013 – a good reason to be optimistic that tourism will play a key role in the country’s future.What remains to be seen, is whether the enormous eco-tourism potential will be fulfilled.Getting there: Both Myitkyina and Putao are served by airports, with several flights per week departing from Yangon and Mandalay. The Mandalay-Myitkyina railroad is another picturesque, worthwhile, but much longer option (24-30 hours). Indawgyi Lake can be reached from Hopin by road only. Road travel can be a problematic during the rainy season.Where to stay: Indawa Guesthouse offers three basic rooms in Lonton (Indawgyi Lake, US$10 per night per person). Putao Trekking House has four simple but lovely wooden bungalows set in a charming garden surrounded by grapefruit trees (US$50 per person per night – www.putaotrekkinghouse.com).","/lifestyle/12637-myanmar-s-far-north-the-final-frontier.html"
"285",285,"Competition coming in aid financing",2014-11-24,"Opinion","There is a significant change on the horizon in the way the world delivers aid financing to developing countries. Western nations and their supporters have dominated aid lending since the end of the Second World War, through institutions like the World Bank, IMF and Asian Development Bank.          China, however, has launched a challenge to the current order.On October 31, representatives of 22 countries, including Myanmar, signed up for the China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which may significantly affect the way aid finance is delivered in the region. Expected to begin operations at the end of next year, it is backed by other regional heavyweights such as India, Singapore and Qatar, while Australia and South Korea withdrew their support after initially showing interest.Expected to focus on financing infrastructure and large-scale energy projects, the arrival of the AIIB, another multi-lateral development aid donor, seems like a tempting source to address Myanmar’s nearly insatiable thirst for infrastructure investment. Yet the formation of the AIIB raises a number of questions over the future of development assistance to Myanmar and Asia as a whole.Concerns over an institution led by the Chinese echoes opinions expressed most loudly by the Americans. They have openly been lobbying against the formation of the bank, arguing that the AIIB would undercut current work by other institutions, particularly the Asian Development Bank, an institution which recently announced its re-entry into Myanmar following a 25-year absence. Other concerns are that the AIIB would fail to meet internationally acceptable environmental, labour and resettlement standards, and that it may also serve as a form of “soft diplomacy” to expand China’s sphere of influence in Asia. Whilst it is easy to get lost in the sea of politics surrounding aid and foreign investments in general, we must consider the potential economic implications for Myanmar of a new and powerful player in the aid financing world.Certainly Myanmar stands to benefit from more subsidised lending. Research turns up a positive relationship between infrastructure investment and growth, especially in poorer countries. More money flowing into Myanmar to support development could be positive – provided it is properly managed.The AIIB is expected to fund projects in areas like transportation, telecommunications and energy, all of which require huge amounts of capital over a significant period of time. China is no stranger to these kinds of large infrastructure projects and has the resources to make an impact. While the ADB has about US$78 billion in capital, the China-backed AIIB is projected to have $50 billion to $100 billion when it starts, making it an immediate and significant potential partner for larger, potentially country-wide, investments.Beyond the size of the funds China is bringing to development financing, the presence of another competitor ought to push the existing institutions to improve what they offer. Economic theory teaches us that greater levels of competition in a market provide overwhelming benefits to the consumer: cheaper prices, higher quality goods and increased choice are the result. The beneficiary, in this case the government of Myanmar, would have more choice of lending agencies, with different prices and terms and conditions.There is already moderate competition in development aid. Japan, France and Germany also run bilateral subsidised loan programs in parallel with funding the multi-lateral agencies – so there is already no monopoly of Bretton Woods institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. The argument to stop one more competitor looks thin – this new investment bank may provide a fresh and innovative approach to growth more tailored to Myanmar’s needs.Increasing quantity of investments in Myanmar is commendable, but there are risks. Growing competition among financial institutions, particularly for the high-return, low-risk projects, could lead to a “race to the bottom” as those receiving the money now have more leverage and may demand fewer loan conditions, such as discarding feasibility analysis or environmental protection measures. Donors may weaken or simply ignore some of their regulations that ensure the quality of projects to get loans accepted. If total loan volume goes up, then inevitably the average economic return on investments will decline. This will encourage corruption and low productivity investments.In economics, “Dutch disease” describes when a large influx of foreign funds into a country, which are not in turn invested in raising productivity, leads to an over-valued exchange rate and a collapse in exports. Suddenly building new roads, factories and large infrastructure projects also puts strain on labour and other resources, pushing up their prices. If unmanaged, funds aimed at improving the country could lead to inflation and economic turmoil.Additionally, overlapping and conflicting aid programs could become harmful by working at cross-purposes and wasting money, which will ultimately hinder Myanmar’s development. Currently the World Bank, the ADB and JICA generally coordinate amongst themselves to consciously minimise competition and waste – the AIIB needs to become a fourth planning partner. It would be wise for the AIIB to co-finance many early projects while learning from and cooperating with existing players.The AIIB should also alleviate fears about their loans being “soft on safeguards”. Providing funding to projects without considering areas like environmental protection, land resettlement and labour rights could mean projects cause more problems than they solve. The AIIB need to make it clear in a policy statement that it will adhere to the appropriate safeguards, transparency and commitments to donor accords and untied aid expected by a responsible multi-lateral investor.But the responsibility isn’t just with the donors. The government of Myanmar also needs to get serious about cost-benefit analysis of new large projects in the planning stages. Some loans also come with strings attached or other complications, and it is sometimes best not to borrow. As the volume of funds exceeds available reasonable-return projects, getting third-party professional and independent cost-analysis done early is increasingly wise.The AIIB is set to introduce new financing, fresh ideas and more competition into the Western-run clique of aid agencies, shaking up the whole multi-lateral donor system. Myanmar ought to embrace the initiative, provided the intentions of all parties are in the interest of the Myanmar people and the country as a whole.Tom Brookes is an economist for Mekong Economics in Myanmar.

"286",286,"Chinese stampede upsets markets",2014-11-16,"Business","Billions of dollars from opaque sources in China may be flowing into Myanmar each year, causing excessive volatility in areas such as the local real estate market, according to experts. Flows have increased recently as Chinese political and business leaders respond to efforts to curb corruption, causing many to look abroad to store their ill-gotten money.These capital flows are distorting markets through the region, and, to some extent, the world, said Sean Turnell, associate professor of economics at Australia’s Macquarie University.One manifestation of this is felt in the rising Myanmar real estate market, but this experience is mirrored in many countries, including Australia – where hot Chinese money is creating a very serious real estate “bubble” in Sydney, he said.Experts say these “hot” money inflows are often entering Myanmar asset markets, such as real estate, gems and jade, sometimes in a bid to be beyond the reach of Beijing authorities.Although the real estate sector is notoriously volatile in Myanmar, the jade and gems sector are also affected by similar flows. Mr Turnell said jade is a simple, ancient and easily understood and negotiated instrument for storing and transferring value, and it has seen large swings in export volumes in recent years.“It is no accident that jade sector has been volatile,” he said.Of official jade exports, US$1.3 billion out of a total $1.5 billion goes to China each year, according to the Ministry of Commerce’s statistics, while far more is thought to exit the country through illicit channels.“Hot Chinese money will create difficulties for macroeconomic management, not just as setting monetary policy, but also in the emergence of market bubbles whose ‘bursting’ can cause great damage – not just the losses that follow, but also for notions of market integrity,” he said.While managing these inflows isimportant, it will also be difficult tostem the tide. Even countries with well-established regulatory regimes have difficulty with these “hot” capital flows, though it is crucial to attempt to address the problem.China has launched a well-publicised anti-corruption drive initiated by president Xi Jinping, which has contributed to the recent capital flows to Myanmar.Mr Turnell said some Chinese political officials and businesspeople are responding to Beijing’s efforts to get a handle on their internal corruption by joining a “stampede” of capital out of the country.“The volumes are so large, the problem so acute. In all of it we haveto ascribe blame too where itis primarily due – China,” he said.“China is exporting its instability,its corruption, its lack of faith in its own institutions,” he added.Government officials say that while they generally have strong cooperation with their Chinese counterparts, money laundering is one area where connections need to be improved. China’s Yangon embassy did not return several requests for interviews for this article.The Chinese government has asked for Myanmar assistance in areas like robbery or finding fugitives, but has yet to ask for assistance in a money laundering case, said U Kyaw Win Thein, Financial Investigation Unit deputy chief and a police colonel.Although these Chinese capitalflows are a significant problem, theyare not the only instance of moneylaundering that occur in the country.Myanmar is working to be removedfrom international body FinancialAction Task Force (FATF)’s annual listthat designates high risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions.The FATF noted that Myanmar hasmade a high-level political commit-ment to work with the organisation,but has not made sufficient progressin implementing its action plan,in an October update. Myanmar forits part has passed a new anti-money laundering law in March 2014but yet to publish the follow-upregulations governing how the lawwill work in practice. While Myanmar’sFinancial Investigation Unit has signed agreements with seven countries on combating money laundering, China is not yet one of them.“China is also a member of FATF,”said U Kyaw Win Thein. “But wewill only be able to cooperate in crossborder [money laundering] affairsafter signing an agreement, which isvery complex.” He added there havebeen some successful anti-moneylaundering moves. The governmenthas also seized about $200 millionworth of kyat during about 70anti-monitoring stings over the past decade. Still, the government’s anti-money laundering efforts could be more pointed.A Central Bank of Myanmar director requesting anonymity said it is not just the burden of the Central Bank to prevent money laundering, as coordinated action must involve several government branches. The director said he advocated for one single government unit to be set up and become responsible for overseeing the issue.Currently, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Myanmar Investment Commission are to check the background of money when it enters the country as an FDI inflow, while the Central Bank’s Financial Information, Inspection and Survey Department is responsible for money remittances.Much of this illegal Chinese capital ends up in the property market. Though Myanmar has not allowed foreigners to buy property for most of its recent history, some foreigners have used local citizens’ identity. Some regional governments seem to fail to inform the central government when this happens, said Ministry of Commerce economic advisor U Maung Aung.While Mandalay has gained a reputation as the property market that is the most affected city by Chinese capital outflows, there have been other areas that have attracted foreign buyers, such as areas in Yangon Region.“Regional governments or [the Ministry of] Home Affairs must know this information – probably they are ignoring it,” he said. “Even senior Chinese officials are involved in this tangle, and businesspeople as well,” he said.The problem can impact domesticsecurity, as well as serving as abarrier to legitimate foreign directinvestment. Bankers say the amountof unofficial money circulation maybe larger than the legitimate sizeof flows. Kanbawza Bank vice president and former deputy governor of the Central Bank U Than Lwin said banks may control 40pc of money circulation while the black market comprises 60pc.“Money coming from outside thecountry should flow throughthe banks to more easily control [money laundering]. The Central Bank should set strong policies to narrow the market,” he said.Property is not the only asset that has been used for money laundering. Automobiles, gold and US dollars have also been affected by speculation in Myanmar, said U Win Myint, secretary of parliament’s Bank and Monetary Affairs Development Committee.“A lack of law enforcement andauthorities avoiding their duty towatch speculators are the mainreasons,” he said. “On the other hand,the government doesn’t have a lot ofexperience.” U Win Myint also saidthat Chinese buyers are not the main cause of the real estate price spike.","/business/12265-chinese-stampede-upsets-markets.html"
"287",287,"Nothing gained or lost for ASEAN chair",2014-11-10,"National News","The second ASEAN Summit for 2014 will be held in Nay Pyi Taw from November 12 to 13.          The summit will be attended not only by leaders of ASEAN’s 10 member countries, but also by other world leaders such as US President Barrack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang.As the host country, Myanmar is therefore getting more attention from the international community and the media compared with previous ASEAN summits held in other countries.Myanmar was ambitious at the beginning of the year when it took over the ASEAN chair from Brunei Darussalam.The government proudly said it would mediate between China and the four ASEAN member countries with which it has territorial disputes in the South China Sea.However, the negotiations did not go well following the first ASEAN Summit in May.Regarding the South China Sea, China wanted to draft individual codes of conduct with each country, while the four ASEAN countries proposed a single code of conduct between China on one side and the regional group on the other.No compromise was reached, and Myanmar suffered its first diplomatic failure in ASEAN politics.The international community and civil society organisations also expected Myanmar to take a leading role in amending terms of reference for the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights.However, Myanmar has failed to work hard to persuade its fellow ASEAN countries about the importance of improving the human rights mechanism for the region. Nothing has changed and no improvements have been made for the protection and promotion of human rights for the citizens of ASEAN.Myanmar will therefore not get any applause for its role in leading ASEAN during the year of its chairship.On the other hand, it will not be criticised by other ASEAN countries for its handling of the South China Sea debacle or ASEAN human rights issues. Myanmar has maintained its neutrality in all issues related to the region, and when Malaysia takes over the chair next year, it will face the same unsolved problems.The main topics under discussion at this week’s ASEAN Summit and East Asia Summit will be economic in nature rather than dealing with political or security issues.Plans call for the ASEAN Economic Community to be established in 2015 with six member countries. The four less-developed countries in the regional grouping – Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam – are due to join in 2018.ASEAN member countries are expecting more investment and economic aid from Japan, China and South Korea to ensure the successful implementation of the economic community. But Chinese investment remains controversial in some ASEAN countries, including Vietnam and Myanmar, because public sentiment regarding Chinese development projects is not very positive.Apart from the economic interests of the region, world leaders who attend this week’s summits will likely bring up Myanmar’s political and economic reforms during bilateral talks with President U Thein Sein in Nay Pyi Taw.The reform process is currently stalled due to various unforeseen challenges to U Thein Sein’s administration. One of the biggest obstacles is finalising the peace process, through which the government and armed ethnic groups hope to forge a ceasefire agreement.U Thein Sein might want to show other world leaders the bright side of the national peace process, but this will be difficult: Recent weeks have seen new fighting between the Tatmadaw and some ethnic groups, while the army is under scrutiny for killing a freelance journalist in Mon State last month.It will be challenging for U Thein Sein to face world leaders who have been expecting too much from Myanmar’s political reform process.That’s not to say that there have been no positive developments in the lead-up to the summits. Several months have passed with no new outbreaks of sectarian violence, which will allow U Thein Sein’s government to say that it has been effective in controlling these clashes.At the same time, however, the government remains reluctant to accept the Rohingya as one of the officially recognised ethnic groups in Myanmar. The international community and the United Nations will continue pressuring the government on this issue even after its period as the ASEAN chair ends.Overall, Myanmar has successfully passed its responsibility as ASEAN chair without experiencing any major turbulence. Some other countries in the region were not so lucky, such as Thailand, which faced plenty of political instability while chairing ASEAN in 2009-2010.However, Myanmar has not gained any credit for taking a leading role in transforming ASEAN into a people-centred grouping. It has been business as usual for Myanmar and the other member countries in 2014. Nothing gained, nothing lost.","/national-news/12205-nothing-gained-or-lost-for-asean-chair.html"
"288",288,"Indian PM on mission to sell India’s strengths to Myanmar",2014-11-10,"Opinion","On November 11, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will embark on a 10-day visit to Myanmar, Australia and Fiji – his longest overseas trip since taking office in May.          All eyes will be on the East Asia Summit in Myanmar, as well as the G-20 Summit in Australia. Significantly, Mr Modi will also be the first PM to visit Australia in 28 years.Mr Modi’s first stop Myanmar is important for a number of reasons.Firstly, Myanmar is India’s link to Southeast Asia, and thus a crucial component of India’s Look East Policy, now named Act East by the current Indian government.Over the past two decades, successive governments have made assiduous efforts to reach out to Myanmar, realising its strategic importance in the context of India’s ties with Southeast Asia.While the late Rajiv Gandhi, as prime minister, did visit the country in 1987, the real opening-up toward Myanmar took place in the early 1990s during the Narasimha Rao government. Mr Rao, the architect of India’s Look East Policy, realised that India needed to adopt a more pragmatic approach toward Myanmar.Economic relations between both countries were thus initiated, and the first important step was a trade agreement signed in 1994 that gave a strong fillip to the relationship. Trade began between Moreh in Manipur State and Tamu in Myanmar, and between Champhai in Mizoram State and Rhion across the border.Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Myanmar in 2012 with reasonable success: 12 memoranda of understanding were signed, including for the development of the Indo-Myanmar border, an increase in airline services between the countries, and assistance for setting up centres for research in information technology and agriculture.Yet a lot remains to be desired regarding India’s economic ties with Myanmar, as well as regarding connectivity between the two countries.A number of projects were started that have not been completed, the most important being the Kaladan Multi-modal Transport Project – which will connect Calcutta with Sittwe Port – and the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway.Infrastructure at border posts is lacking – the Moreh-Tamu crossing is in dire need of an upgrade – and bus service between Imphal and Mandalay, which was to begin in October, has still not commenced.Secondly, while India has been helping Myanmar build institutional capacity and strengthen sectors like information technology, this work often gets overshadowed by the forays of other countries, especially China.As of June 2014, Chinese foreign direct investment in Myanmar was US$14 billion annually. Major projects initiated by China include the Myitsone dam, the Tarpein hydroelectric project, the Kyaukphyu-Kunming oil pipeline, the Letpadaung copper mine and the Tagaung nickel mine.Chinese trade with Myanmar stands at $6 billion a year, while Indian trade with Myanmar was touching $2 billion as of 2013. While Indian investment has risen – it was over $270 million as of August 2013 – it is nowhere near China’s mammoth investment.It is pertinent to point out that the assistance granted by China is purely commercial in nature, and the terms and conditions of loans are quite stringent. By comparison, Indian assistance is more liberal.Lately there has also been some resentment against the Chinese, which is clearly reinforced by Myanmar’s refusal to accept a loan of $2 billion for a highway connecting Kyaukphyu with Ruili due to protests by locals.Connectivity with Kyaukhphu is important for China, since it would help create an alternative to the Malacca Straits for the transportation of oil from Africa and the Persian Gulf to China.Apart from its strategic and economic importance, Myanmar is also important for India because it is a fellow member of BIMSTEC, along with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Nepal. Both Myanmar and India are also part of the Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM)Will Mr Modi take on China directly?Like in Bhutan and Nepal, it is expected that the Indian prime minister will focus on strengthening connectivity while also providing assistance in institutional development.Mr Modi would send a clear message that while India may not match up to China in economic prowess, it certainly has a major advantage in the context of strong institutions.Apart from conventional assistance, and the development of government and educational institutions, Mr Modi should focus on Indian assistance for monuments that reflect the shared history of both countries, as he did in Nepal.There should also be a focus on integrating India’s northeastern states with Myanmar, as China has done in the case of Yunnan Province.Thirdly, ever since taking his post in May, Mr Modi has sent clear signals that he wants to reach out to Indians settled overseas.Unfortunately, Indians in Myanmar have been neglected by the government of India. According to Myanmar’s 1983 census, the number of Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) living there was in excess of 400,000, more than half of whom were stateless.These PIOs were from numerous ethnicities and a number of states, including Bihar, Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. It is time that those who are stateless are helped by the government of India, and the relevant state governments must also help them to reestablish ties with their country of origin.Finally, it would make sense to find synergies with other countries that have a strong presence in Myanmar, including Japan and Thailand.It is pertinent to point out that Japan in recent times has increased its presence in Myanmar. The approach being followed by Japan is similar to that of India: The terms and conditions of assistance are not as stringent as those of some other countries.With India-Japan ties growing from strength to strength, and with Japan planning to invest in India’s northeast, that country can provide assistance to India in connectivity between the northeast and Myanmar.Synergies can also be found with other countries like Singapore that are increasing their presence in Myanmar. This will help ensure that no single country has an unnecessary stranglehold.Mr Modi has equipped himself well in the sphere of diplomacy. His emphasis on connectivity and building on shared values with neighbours is applicable in Myanmar. It remains to be seen whether he can hard-sell India’s strengths effectively and also infuse the necessary dynamism into the economic and strategic relationship between the two countries.Tridivesh Singh Maini is a senior research associate with the Jindal School of International Affairs in Sonepat, India.","/opinion/12187-indian-pm-on-mission-to-sell-india-s-strengths-to-myanmar.html"
"289",289,"Kokang economic zone comes amid speculation on security",2014-10-27,"Business","Peace in the countryside may be starting to pay dividends with the further development of Kokang economic zone. After three years of deliberations, Myanmar Investment Commission recognised Kokang as a general economic zone on October 3.          Construction is expected to be completed next year, with operations beginning in 2016, said U Kyaw Swe, secretary of the Kokang Self-administered Zone’s government, or leading body.The zone, which could provide up to 20,000 job opportunities, is the first to be established in a self-administrated region. “That is the result of peace,” said U Aung Naing Oo, secretary of the Myanmar Investment Commission.Backers of the zone want it to challenge neighbouring China in the value-added food production market. The zone is located a scant 23 metres from the border in the Kon-Kyan and Laukkai townships that constitute the self-administered zone, and is close to the Chinshwehaw border trading gate in Laukkai.U Aung Naing Oo said the jobs created could help to reduce opium poppy cultivation.“We authorised the zone to start value-added production of agricultural products, since the region is adjacent to China,” he said.U Kyaw Swe said construction is already 20 percent complete. “The government is inviting investment from China, and has even opened negotiations with some investors.”The 1007-acre compound will host a general trading area, as well as zones for hotels, small and medium-sized industries, as well as the trade of construction materials and agricultural machinery and products.U Kyaw Swe said Chinese small and medium business were expected to make up the largest group of investors because of longstanding cultural and business ties, but the zone would welcome businesses from elsewhere in Myanmar and other foreign countries.“Since we are adjacent to China we hope that Chinese small and medium industries will come and invest here,” he said.Under the legal framework of the zone, most of the agricultural-based, value-added production will be carried out as joint ventures with local firms. However, as the number of potential investors from the Kokang region and other parts of Myanmar are likely to be limited at first, Kokang leaders are pushing for more flexible rules.“It is quite difficult to get things done following national policies for everything,” Kokang government head U Be Sou Chien told Irrawaddy. “We want regulations that suit our region.”Historically, Kokang has been plagued with unrest, with fighting breaking out in 2009 between the Tatmadaw and an armed group led by U Phone Kyar Shin. But stability has gradually spread since 2011. Nevertheless, potential investors are still cautious, said U Tun Naing, chair of the Kokang Democracy and Unity Party. “The success of the zone is closely linked to the stability of the region,” he said.U Kyaw Swe said economic development is a priority for residents and that this would help the region maintain stability. “Here business is most important to people living in our region. Residents are very eager to enjoy the benefits of this zone,” said U Kyaw Swe, who is also head of the Laukkai District General Administration Department, a Ministry of Home Affairs body.U Be Sou Chien said his government could guarantee security. “We have the army and police. The U Phone group is the only threat, but it is too weak to occupy much territory. The self-administrative government fully guarantees the security of investors and their property,” he told Irrawaddy.","/business/12092-kokang-economic-zone-comes-amid-speculation-on-security.html"
"290",290,"Good fortune is 50/50 luck and vision",2014-10-21,"Mandalay","As well as beauty, jade offers considerable possibility for return on investment. After all, in what other industry could you get started with a mere K100,000? And possibly turn a profit on your very first day?          “In 2012, a friend of mine who is not a jade trader had K2 million and bought some bracelet-shape jade,” recalls experienced Mandalay jade broker U Myo Lwin.“He had to spend K1.8 million for the precious stones. Three days later, a customer from China bought them from him, paying K2.3 million. That is exactly what we call luck!”Even experienced jade traders usually don’t earn K500,000 in just a couple of days, U Myo Lwin added. On the other hand, such sudden gains are a sign of a volatile industry, and the same factors that allow unexpected profits can bring unexpected losses.The jade pieces being bought and sold at the Mandalay market can be broken down into five categories: finished products (jewellery); raw stones; bracelets; beads; and carvings. The first three categories require a more substantial investment. But beads and carved sculptures are generally priced lower, and make a good starting point for those looking to enter the trade.Rosary-bead-shaped jade is a low-risk bet for most, who later move up to blossom- and plate-shaped pieces.As with any business, though, it’s not just a matter of having the right stock. Success with jade requires social skills, cleverness and luck – a rare combination.Jade deals usually involve three parties: a buyer, a seller and a broker as intermediary. Some brokers, however, have their own profits first in mind, U Myo Lwin said. Fortunately it has been a long time since he has heard of any egregious swindles in which brokers were found to be lying to the buyer, the seller or both, though it has happened in the past.Jade means big money, and Mandalay is well-situated to capitalise on it, especially given Myanmar’s resources and the city’s easy proximity to China, where eager buyers wait. (“Gold is valuable, jade is priceless,” goes one Chinese saying).That philosophy is a boon for Myanmar: A 2013 report by Harvard’s Ash Centre for Democratic Governance and Innovation estimated 2011 output at around $7.8 billion – though at least $3.4 of that was through unauthorised channels.Total trade at the Mandalay market alone reaches around K100 million a day, estimates Ko Gu Gu, a trader – though the days when buyers from China are in town there are heaps of cash everywhere.“When stone traders from China come to buy, this [average] amount can be much higher,” Ko Gu Gu says.Dividing these spoils are brokers, jade crafters, jade firms and young apprentices who are learning the trade. Ko Gu Gu said there are also a few businesspeople handling large trades who no longer come to the market but work out of their residences.One lesson Ko Gu Gu has learned is that traders of an ethnic Chinese background are willing to hold on to stones longer, while Myanmar traders – who he says have fewer financial resources – are more often looking for a faster flip.“They often sell the stones as soon as they are offered a higher price than what they bought at. They do not give profit enough time to grow,” Ko Gu Gu says.One student of jade, Ko Myo Min, said the life-changing possibilities are why he is taking up this career. “The quickest way to riches here is through the jade business,” he says, adding that luck does play a role but that jade is still the best bet for bringing “great change” in life. “It attracted me to jump in and swim in this ocean of the jade business.”Translation by Lun Min Mang","/special-features/199-mandalay-2014/12057-good-fortune-is-50-50-luck-and-vision.html"

The Myawaddy crossing to the Thai city of Mae Sot has the second-highest trade volumes for a Myanmar border gate, behind the gate at Muse in Shan State on the Chinese border.U Kyaw Tint said the new project is about 5 miles (8 kilometres) from the crossing, and is hoping to address Thai businesses to come and set up shop.“Land prices at the zone will be cheaper than other land in the area,” he said. The firm is also planning to lease out land to foreigners, mostly from Thailand, as they cannot purchase property.The zone will sit on about 315 acres in total, with the first phase of 45 plots on 141 acres being put on sale next month, he said. One acre with road access will sell for K80 million, well below prices in Yangon.Myawaddy Industrial Zone will also include an electricity supply, telecommunications and water.Myanmar has about two dozen industrial zones, though most are clustered in Yangon Region. The government has promoted building new industrial zones through the country, aiming to promote regional job opportunities and local development.However, industrial zones have been beset by speculators who purchase plots with no intention of developing them, instead hoping for rising land prices.U Kyaw Tint said the company will try to make sure only investors interested in establishing manufacturing or services operations will be allowed to set up.“If we see buyers who keep the land to sell at a higher price, without doing business, then we will take the lands back and refund the buyers,” he said.Government officials have also said they are looking at the problem of land being locked up by speculators, though actions have been slow so far.Local residents told The Myanmar Times that industrial zones have been slow to take hold in the area.Nearby Mawlamyine city boasts an industrial zone, though there are few investors partially due to a shoddy electricity supply, according to Mawlamyine resident U Soe Htut.Still, U Kyaw Tint said he hopes the growing importance of Thai investment will drive the border industrial zone.","/business/11925-land-at-border-industrial-zone-going-on-sale-in-november.html"

Growth will not be focused solely in Yangon in the years ahead, and other cities will also be home to modern property developments in the near-term, he said at the Myanmar Global Investment Forum in Nay Pyi Taw on September 17.“Cities are critical for economic growth for countries, and also for governance, for social services. But there’s been insufficient investment in [Myanmar’s] infrastructure over the past decade[s],” he said during a panel discussion.New Star Light is working on two large-scale projects in upper Myanmar, including the Mingalar Mandalay mixed development and a business district project in Muse in Shan State on the Chinese border.Mr Kamayana said Muse will only grow in importance, with 60 percent of Myanmar’s trade with China already travelling through the gate.“It’s a bustling small town, but on the other side of the border is the city of the Shweli with 1.5 million people. And there’s such a stark contrast,” he said.Yet developers face a number of challenges, such as securing land and access to capital, that are hindering growth, while urban planning efforts also need to be improved. The process of awarding land must also be evenly enforced, experts say.Land tenders should be transparently conducted to give firms a fair shot at securing leases, according to Cyrus Pun, executive director of Yoma Strategic Holdings.“It needs to be a process used by everyone, not some ministries using it, some ministries not using it,” he told The Myanmar Times.It is also important that policies are not only transparent but also accurately transmitted to the wider community, he said.“If important decisions are not being conveyed, that’s when people become skeptical,” he said.U Kan Zaw, minister of national planning and economic development, said a number of areas in the housing market need improvement, including better housing finance and the construction companies themselves.Mr Pun said that while access to finance is a challenge for developers, banking reforms should help ease the constraint.","/business/property-news/11732-expanding-urban-population-changes-property-needs.html"
"295",295,"MPs lead charge as critics slam city plan",2014-08-30,"National News","White elephant, visionary development or dodgy business deal? The Yangon Region government’s proposal for a massive city expansion project with a mysterious public company linked to Chinese interests has sparked intense debate, with pressure growing on the authorities to disclose further details of their plan.          The expansion project covers 30,000 acres to the west of the city’s current boundaries between the Pan Hlaing River, Twante Canal and Hlaing River, including sections of Twante, Kyeemyindaing and Seik Gyi Kha Naung To townships.Yangon Mayor U Hla Myint revealed details of the project to the Yangon Region Hluttaw on August 22, telling MPs that public company Myanma Saytannar Myothit had been awarded the contract to develop the project, adding that 70 percent of the project would be completed within three years.According to the mayor, government will receive 20,000 low-cost homes, an orphanage, home for the aged and six toll-free bridges, each comprising six lanes. Existing residents would be taken care of, he said.MPs said they were “shocked” at the revelation and pushed for further information, including how many people would likely be displaced and questioned how the regional government had made the decision to sign a contract with a very new company on such a large project. The mayor responded that information about the project was restricted “to reduce unnecessary risk” and refused to reveal further details.Even the representative for Twante said he had no idea about the plan.“It was a terrible surprise,” said U Thein Zaw Myint, who represents the Union Solidarity and Development Party.“We only knew about it when the mayor read the message in parliament.”He said the project area encompasses 15 villages in Twante township and he was determined to find out if residents would be affected. “I'm going to ask questions in parliament about what they have planned for the villages in my constituency.”While schedule two of the 2008 constitution allows region and state governments to undertake development projects, MPs said the scale and cost of the proposed city expansion meant it should also require Pyidaungsu Hluttaw approval, particularly to head off potential land disputes.Region hluttaw MP Daw Nyo Nyo Thin questioned why the government was being so secretive and said it should be forced to provide more detail on the project. “I can't understand why [the mayor] has not allowed this project to be discussed [in parliament],” she said. “I think the government has many secrets to hide concerning this project. For example, we don't even know how they chose the company.”According to the Myanmar Investment Commission, Myanma Saytannar Myothit was registered at the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development as a public company in December 2013.Its registered address is between U Shwe Pin and Myat Eain Yar Street at No 3 Shwe Pyi Thar Industrial Zone but media reports said it has no presence at the site.Construction industry sources said it is run by two Chinese businessmen, Xiao Pun and Xiao San. Both have close relations with former top military officials, including current Yangon Region Chief Minister U Myint Swe.The nationality of the men has prompted speculation that the funding for the project will come from Chinese companies.Myanma Saytannar Myothit has already completed a number of deals with the regional government, including several businesses in People’s Park and a car parking business on state land beside Shin Saw Phu Road.The company’s managing director, U Thet Oo, refused to comment when contacted last week by Irrawaddy.The scale of the project has also come under fire from some in the property development sector, who said it risked becoming a white elephant.U Ko Ko Htwe, owner of Taw Win Family Construction, said apartment-based developments could yield 100 dwellings per acre, meaning the site would be large enough to provide homes for more than 10 million people.“If five people stay in one household, it could have up to 15 million people. That’s almost three times the population of Yangon now. Who will live in all of these places?” he said. “We should consider whether the project is really needed for development of our local people.”He also questioned why the Yangon Region government had not called a tender for the project, describing it as inconsistent with the president’s “good governance and clean government” policy.U Win Myint, the Pyithu Hluttaw representative for Hlaing and a member of the Pyithu Hluttaw Commission for the Assessment of Legal Affairs and Special Issues, said it was unclear whether the regional government would be legally obligated to seek parliamentary permission for the project.“It’s difficult to say because I don't know the exact details about the project,” he said. “But if it is a big project, they should explain to parliament and public transparently how will they implement it,” he said.Presidential spokesperson U Ye Htut declined to comment on whether the decision to award the contract to Myanma Saytannar Myothit may have breached President U Thein Sein’s rules for government tenders, which were introduced in 2013.“It would be better to ask to [the Yangon Region government] because the [2008] constitution gives authority [for development projects] to the regional government,” he said.","/national-news/11496-city-of-dreams-regional-govt-draws-fire-on-city-expansion-contract.html"
"296",296,"Potential strong for Yunnan trade ",2014-08-25,"Business","Opportunities abound for exports to China’s southern Yunnan province, but trade barriers are preventing the free flow of goods, say businesspeople. The Chinese central government does not yet allow locally produced products, particularly agricultural goods, to be exported to Yunnan without the proper certifications, while relatively high taxes also lead to smuggling, said U Ko Lay, patron of the Kachin State Chamber of Commerce and Industries.“[Yunnan officials] say they will life the border restrictions once the central government permits, and rice, maize and rubber could all be exported in the future,” he said at a meeting in Yangon on August 14.U Ko Lay added that there are lots of opportunities for Myanmar exporters to Yunnan, which will increase in the future.Su Hongtao, vice governor of Dehong Prefecture in Yunnan Province, said China has stringent import requirements, but also eyes Myanmar as a source particularly of agricultural products.“We would like to import … but we need to make sure to examine the quality standards with local and Chinese participation, and to raise the present level of agricultural products,” he said.Some traders have complained rice sacks are being turned away at the crossing at Muse in Shan State as well as at the Kachin-Yunnan border. Myanmar is a growing rice exporter to China, but from Beijing’s point of view any rice imports from Myanmar are informal, as the two countries have not yet signed an agreement laying out health standards.Still, Yunnan and Myanmar are becoming increasingly close trading partners.Bilateral trade reached US$4.173 billion in 2013, an 83.6 percent increase compared to figures a year earlier.But trade from January to June 2014 looks set to jump past last year’s market, with trade at $3.223 billion for the first half of the year, according to a set of statistics provided by Yunnan Province officials.Yunnan businesspeople have established 41 firms in Myanmar, with contracted investment of $8.79 billion and actual investment of $1.108 billion, the statistics show.Yunnan Province commerce department official Du Junjun said Myanmar is a major market for Yunnan enterprises, with entrepreneurs having signed hundreds of bilateral contracts, including in areas like ports, hydropower and road construction.The Kachin Chamber of Commerce also submitted a complaint during the meeting directed at some Chinese businesspeople that they said were producing goods in Kachin State, but exporting the products without marking them as made in Myanmar.","/business/11459-potential-strong-for-yunnan-trade.html"

Foreign minister John Baird officially opened the office in Centrepoint Towers on Kyauktada township’s Sule Pagoda Road on August 8, saying Canada aims to encourage economic development and job creation as well as support development initiatives like children’s health in Myanmar.“Trade [between the two countries] is low but there is tremendous opportunity,” he said.Mr Baird added that Canada has been following Myanmar’s ongoing reforms closely and looks to support them, as well as promote further economic development.Canada previously maintained some of the toughest international sanctions against Myanmar with its 2007 Burma Regulations. Most sanctions were removed on April 24, 2012, including restrictions on investment and trade, following the reforms of the President U Thein Sein administration.Myanmar and Canada have had limited relations during the sanctions period, but Mr Baird said the embassy opening reflects Canada’s intentions to increase engagement with Myanmar.“Canada has opened its embassy in Yangon today as part of our desire to play a more active role in continuing Burma’s transformation,” he said.“Our engagement brings to bear diplomacy, trade and development, and I look forward to seeing progress in these areas.”Mr Baird – who was making his second trip to Myanmar as foreign minister – said that Canada brings business strengths in areas like finance, energy, mining and agriculture.Although there have historically been relatively few Canadian investments in Myanmar, they have sometimes proven controversial. Canadian firm Ivanhoe Mines copper mining activities faced some international opposition until it exited its share in the project to a trust in 2007, which ultimately divested the project in 2011 to a Chinese weapons manufacturer.Other past Canadian involvement in Myanmar includes assistance in areas like infrastructure projects and social development.Asked about the image of Canadian mining in general, Mr Baird said that Canadian mining firms usually conduct responsible operations.“We expect the mining sector to continue to act responsibly according to local laws, engage with communities, respect environmental standards – by and large I think they have a pretty good record of that,” he said.“They’re not perfect; there have been problems as there is in just about every sector.”Mr Baird added that mining has been a source of a lot of wealth generation in Canada, generating economic development and assisting the country with providing quality healthcare and education. Canadian mining firms generally hire local workers rather than bringing their own miners with them, which increases the benefit for local communities, he said.During the opening ceremony, Mr Baird and Canadian ambassador Mark McDowell took reporters on a tour of the small but pleasant embassy, which occupies about a third of the ninth floor of Centrepoint Towers.On the tour, Mr McDowell said designing an embassy is always difficult, but that the lunch room is a particular success, offering pleasant views facing toward the Yangon river and providing a space for people to connect.","/business/11373-canadian-embassy-comes-to-town.html"
"298",298,"Between miracle and myth ",2014-08-11,"Business","Following his “flipping the switch” on politics, Myanmar’s reformist President Thein Sein has embraced donors on an agenda of establishing good governance and economic liberalisation.          Early reforms have spurred growth to around 8 percent and together they extrapolate this trend out to 2030 and the attainment of middle income status almost as if it is already in the bag. Not wanting to be seen as a spoiler, neither side has an interest in deviating from this new economic narrative.But economic liberalisation can perpetuate the political economy dynamics of the resource curse. FDI targets resource enclaves while the elite benefit from increased “resource rents” and their recycling into the real estate and consumer imports booms. The elite’s power is enhanced and they can adapt to and exploit the country’s nascent democracy. Much of FDI is targeting the oil and gas sector, and will also target mining once the new law comes out. FDI is also targeting real estate but this sector is cyclical and currently booming due to a once-off increase in requirements from foreigners. Foreigners are also interested in the domestic consumer market but it is small. Few foreign investors are interested in the country to establish export platforms for manufacturing, an area where job creation has scale potential to drive high and inclusive growth.There has to be a structural change in the economy that establishes external competitiveness for investment in export manufacturing to be feasible. The sudden US$2.6 billion trade deficit in 2013-14 should raise a red flag to policy makers, but donors feel that trade deficits can be financed by FDI and official development assistance for many years to come. But that does not sound much like the establishment of the export growth model that has served so many Asian countries so well. The currency is strong because of resource exports, particularly gas, and needs to be depreciated by around 20-25pc to establish competitiveness for exports of agricultural commodities and labour-intensive manufactures. The country also requires infrastructure development for competitiveness and here the “politically correct” agenda of the donors may be a challenge for national policy makers.The donor-led good governance agenda emphasises “process”, such as the importance of transparency and best international practice, and the use of environmental and social impact assessments and international competitive tenders. This creates opportunities for international firms who can work to such standards, and in telecommunications, where industry fundamentals are well understood and compelling, it has worked quite well. However, in other important infrastructure sectors such as power and transportation, foreign investors struggle where economic parameters may be less well defined and ministries need to be navigated, where local knowledge is at a premium. There have only been a handful of FDI approvals in small-scale power generation so far, and in transportation and SEZ development Thilawa has been hardgoing and Kyaukphyu and Dawei have stalled completely.Donor emphasis on governance and exemplary process means that mainly public sector agencies, both domestic and international, tend to be involved in early stage infrastructure project development, because the private sector will be less inclined to input if they are later subject to competitive tender for the concession. And these public sector agencies are challenged by issues of coordination, bureaucracy and staff incentive. To speed things up, the government needs to work closely with the big local conglomerates to identify the major infrastructure projects that are “bankable”, and grant the concessions that empower Myanmar’s most capable entrepreneurs to engage foreign capital and technical resources.To support the local conglomerates as infrastructure project promoters the government needs to stimulate the international funding environment. The “special relationship” with Beijing needs to be resurrected but with the message that the old G-to-G FDI approach doesn’t work anymore, that it now generates too much political heat. Beijing needs to understand that Myanmar’s politicians must be responsive to citizenry concerns over China’s rapid rise, a situation that now pervades the region following China’s posturing in the South China Sea. Since Chinese companies benefit from the existence of good infrastructure in Myanmar and in the wider region, they can best facilitate by moving towards a portfolio investment approach, underwriting and investing in project bond issues, some of which might be RMB denominated. With Beijing back in Myanmar’s infrastructure development game with a fresh approach, donors like the International Finance Corporation might respond to some healthy competition and be galvanised into proper infrastructure lending rather than just real estate.With an infrastructure boom initiated, the government will need to formulate a nuanced industrial policy. They can learn from the past industrial policies of the successful economies in the region. Exports should serve as the objective performance standard for firms to receive subsidies in certain industries, and the government should cull losers rather than attempt to pick winners. Some infant industry protection may also be desirable.Myanmar is no doubt emerging into the regional and global economy at a very challenging time. There is no room for donor complacency regarding whether the country makes a successful transition from a resource-dependent economy to one based on labour-intensive manufacturing exports and a climbing of the technology ladder. Ultimately, whether Myanmar hews closer to economic “miracle” or “myth” hinges on the vision and quality of the country’s top political leadership.Stuart Larkin is a Visiting Fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore.

"299",299,"South China Sea again dominates summit talks",2014-08-10,"National News","ASEAN members say they will push China to advance consultations in an attempt to resolve territorial disputes in the South China Sea, with the maritime issue poised to dominate yet another meeting of the 10-nation bloc.          Acting Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said following the ASEAN-China ministerial meeting - part of the larger ASEAN Regional Forum that took place in Nay Pyi Taw over the weekend - that Southeast Asian countries would step up their efforts at dialogue.""We want to see peace prevail in the South China Sea and for this reason we want to advance both the full and effective implementation of the DOC [Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea],"" Mr Sihasak said.He added that ASEAN wants to ""intensify official consultations of a code of conduct"" during the next round of meetings on the issue, which will be held in Thailand in October.In 2002, China and ASEAN signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. However, implementation has stalled amid negotiations over a code of conduct, a binding agreement that China appears reluctant to agree to.Standing alongside Mr Sihasak, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China also hoped to finalise the DOC implementation at an ""early date"". However, he also cautioned that his country has a right to protect its sovereignty and warned against acts of provocation in the waters.Malcolm Cook, a senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, told The Myanmar Times that there was reason to doubt China's commitment to the declaration given recent actions.""China has consistently stated that a code of conduct will not impinge upon the exercise of its sovereign claims in the South China Sea and Chinese actions before and since the May ASEAN leaders summit are clearly not consistent with the declaration of conduct [agreement],"" Mr Cook said.""Actions speak louder than diplomatic words,"" he added.Nay Pyi Taw has been eager to use its position of chair of ASEAN to showcase reforms initiated by President U Thein Sein's administration, after the country spent the better part of 17 years on the fringes of the regional bloc because of concerns over human rights abuses.But the major meetings it has hosted this year have instead focused primarily on the ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea.At the ASEAN Summit in May, regional leaders issued a statement in which they expressed ""serious concerns"" over incidents in the South China Sea that took place just days before they gathered in Nay Pyi Taw.Vietnamese officials have accused Chinese ships of ramming Vietnamese vessels and spraying them with water cannon near the Paracel Islands. The islands are controlled by China but claimed by Vietnam.In early May, a rig from the state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation began drilling for oil near the islands. China has claimed that Vietnam is attempting to disrupt these activities.Meanwhile, officials from the Philippines apprehended a Chinese fishing boat and its 11-member crew near the Spratly Islands on May 7. The Philippines accused the fishermen of being in possession of hundreds of illegally caught turtles.China removed the disputed oil rig on July 15, a month earlier than the original deadline. But just days ahead of this latest summit, Chinese state media reported that Beijing plans to build lighthouses on five islands in the disputed waters.Prior to Myanmar assuming the leadership of ASEAN for the first time, some observers had expressed concern that its close ties to China could impact its handling of the South China Sea issue, as occurred in Cambodia in 2012.That year Cambodia was seen as acting on behalf of Chinese interests in the region, and as a result one summit ended without a joint statement being issued for the first time in decades.But those fears were largely dispelled by the statement of concern issued by leaders and the united front presented by ASEAN.Rachel Calvert, a senior consultant at HIS in Singapore, said that the statement being issued in Nay Pyi Taw showed a concern over Beijing's investment and leverage in Myanmar, but that Myanmar struck a balance by not directing calling out China, so that ""no finger was pointed"".""Myanmar officials have vowed privately to avoid another 'Cambodia incident',"" said Yun Sun, a fellow with the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, DC.""But at the same time, they also made it clear that it will not allow Vietnam and Philippines to turn ASEAN into an anti-China forum this year.""Tensions in the South China Sea have garnered little attention in Myanmar and President U Thein Sein has sought to avoid the issue where possible.In his address at the opening of the ASEAN Regional Forum on August 8, U Thein Sein said only that he wished ""to resort to peaceful settlement of disputes and differences"".""South China Sea is not Myanmar's fight,"" Ms Sun said, adding that it instead made sense for Myanmar to take a ""middle way approach"".""[T]here is no need for Myanmar to assert a strong position … [and] upset anyone.""","/national-news/11300-south-china-sea-again-dominates-asean-agenda.html"
"300",300,"Small loans, big change",2014-07-15,"Your Money","People in town, they are very rich,” says Ko Min (not his real name), who helps organise a small microcredit organisation. “People in the countryside, they are very poor.”          It’s precisely among the very poor – usually in the countryside, usually women – that microfinance is most necessary, and most effective.Microfinance simply means extending instruments of banking to those who are outside the reach of regular institutions. In its most common form, microcredit, this involves issuing small loans to those who cannot afford collateral and would not qualify for credit at ordinary institutions. But savings plans are also an important, albeit less talked-about, part of microfinance, and help give communities long-term security.Villagers nearby where Ko Min lives, he says, used to borrow from banks at 3 percent monthly interest, he says, or – when banks turned them down as unsafe risks without collateral – from Chinese moneylenders at 10pc. The interest sometimes left them further in debt than when they started.Thanks to Ko Min’s microfinance institution (MFI), however, families nearby now access loans at 1.5pc interest. The loans are affordable, making them safe bets for borrowers. But at the same time the need to pay motivates them to put the loans toward something long-term.One woman with a blind daughter converted part of her home into a shop so she could make a living without leaving her child’s side.Another woman, widowed, fixed up her husband’s tools so she could take up his old job to support her children.A third woman, single, bought two second-hand sewing machines and started her own business, saving enough money so she could study Law and eventually leave home to take a position at a firm.Ko Min’s organisation has a few hundred of these stories, one for each loan they’ve offered. Education is the primary motivating factor in most loans, and by using microcredit to stir local industry it contributes to long-term, second-generation economic growth.And since he and the lending committee research what the loan will be used for – for instance, helping ensure the sewing machine an applicant wants is in good repair before she borrows money to buy it – the risk of lending is low. Ko Min reports over an over-99pc rate of return, typical for the microcredit model.Microfinance, Ko Min says, has changed his whole idea of how to solve the problem of poverty. When Myanmar people want to help out the poor, they are accustomed to “make a donation once and that’s it”, he says. But microfinance isn’t about charity. It’s about extending the benefits of banking – a place to save, a chance to borrow – to those who have so far been excluded from it, and then seeing how those people will grow once they’re given the same economic resources as those of the middle and upper classes. At its heart, it’s about investment in the vast energy and ability of those whom society has profoundly overlooked as a source of industry and initiative: the poor.The most successful model of microfinance can be traced to Grameen Bank – Bangladesh’s so-called “Bank of the Poor” – and its founder Mohammed Yunis. In the wake of a 1974 famine, Yunis gave a small loan for a few dozen families to start small businesses, believing that loans, rather than charity, would help them most because it would encourage transformational activity.The model spread. By 1983, Grameen Bank was founded as a fully authorised lending institution, centred around the idea that collateral – the usual requirement for those pursuing loans – is precisely what those who are most in need of credit don’t have. Instead, groups of people serve as collective guarantors for loans: This “social collateral” pushed borrowers to make good use of the loans. The bank also found women made better credit bets, being more reliable and having more room for growth.By 2006, the year Grameen and Yunus shared the Nobel Peace Prize, over US$5 billion in loans had been given out.The United Nations Development Programme began offering microfinance operations in Myanmar on the Grameen model for the first time in 1997. (Grameen itself administered one of the UN’s projects, under a build, operate, transfer agreement until 2002.)One problem for the fledgling microfinance sector generally, however, was a lack of legal framework under which MFIs could operate. MFIs were not covered under the 1990 Financial Institutions of Myanmar Act. From the UN down to the smallest organisation, microfinance was – like much else that happened in the country – illegal but condoned.“MFIs in Burma do not have legal status,” economist Sean Turnell wrote in Fiery Dragons, his pre-reforms history of economics in Myanmar, “and whatever standing they have is dependent upon the whim of the country’s military regime and the esteem of their founding NGOs.”Today microfinance is notable as a sector in which ownership, investment and capital can all come from abroad. Back then, however, this was a riskier proposition for some small-scale organisations.Ko Min’s organisation, for example, in the early years depended primarily on money raised abroad by Jane (not her real name), a foreigner with no connection to the country except a desire to help.For this article, Jane requested that the identities of her, her local partners and their organisation remain anonymous, as for years they were among those operating without a permit and she said she did not want any recrimination to result for those still working in-country.“I started to give away money to people who needed. My uncle, who worked in Asia a lot, said to me, ‘You can continue giving away your money, but you better let it come back.’ Burma was on the blacklist so importing things was not a good idea, and I am not a selling type of person. So [Ko Min] and I thought of microcredit.”Like Ko Min, microfinance moved her away from donations and toward the model of constructive loans instead.“And it works. With five women together in a group this gives support and they do pay back.”The first loan came from Ko Min and a friend. Jane added her own money when she learned of what they were doing, then started raising money at home, fundraising through a network of donors.“Travellers started to give me $50 because they wanted to help out but did not know where or how.”Making semi-yearly trips, she brought in the money she had raised in her luggage, handing it over to Ko Min and others who then put it into use in the community.Asked if she has any particular success stories she is proud of, she says simply, “I find it difficult to hear the stories of the women. I start to cry.”But she is also quick to downplay her role in the dramatic changes the organisation has enabled. “There are many small co-operatives. I’m doing nothing more than cooperating with the local parties … I’m working with them and they are doing everything.“As rudimentary as these sorts of models were in the early days, they were working. In 2003, the UNDP recommended that the establishment of a framework for microfinance – in other words, letting microfinance grow, officially – would represent “the single policy change with the most impact on rural poverty”.That policy change came in November 2011. Giving previously unregulated organisations a place within a regulated system, the Microfinance Law opened the door for those who don’t qualify for bank loans to access credit, making it one of the unsung developments of the U Thein Sein government.The law says microcredit loans must be capped at 2.5pc flat interest per month. Savings must return a minimum of 1.25% flat interest per month.Since December 2011, over 189 microfinance licences have been issued, in five categories: donor-funded NGOs; donor-funded INGOs; local MFIs operating for profit; co-operatives that have registered as MFIs; and foreign-owned MFIs. Groups that were formerly outside the law are allowed to establish themselves officially. A shareholder-run bank, the Myanmar Microfinance Bank, was established July 2, 2013, offering loans at half the current interest rate.In the biggest shake-up in this growing sector, on June 4 of this year the UNDP transferred all responsibility and assets to the Pact Global Microfinance Fund (PGMF), its implementing partner since 2006.“This is a case of a project that has successfully closed after 17 years which will continue to provide dividends to more than half a million people after UNDP exits,” says Igor Bosc, UNDP senior programme advisor.“This exit is also in line with UNDP’s new Country Programme, through which UNDP works in three broad areas – local governance, environmental governance and democratic governance. UNDP will however continue to work in the microfinance sector by supporting policy development.”PGMF uses textbook microfinance theory – small loans, lending groups, mandatory savings, credit mostly to women. It’s called “solidary lending methodology”, the INGO’s local general manager U Maung Maung says.“To have access to credit a small group of five members has to be formed. Loans are without collateral and members can invest in whatever microenterprise they believe will improve their income.”Assuming five family members per household, U Maung Maung says, PGMF alone could be serving about 5% of the total population of the country.U Maung Maung says the program, which maintains a 99pc repayment rate, is built primarily on trust.“Explaining social collateral is not that difficult, but to practise it and maintain group solidarity takes time. They have to form the small group by themselves with like-minded people, knowing each other, then the trust among them can be built without difficulty.”He says success depends on the facilitator, the strength of the staff and how well (and how often) she can explain group solidarity. Trust can also increase over time, he adds, but only “if the institution understands the hardships faced by the clients and initiates the appropriate services they require”.The model also benefits from attention to gender roles in the community: There are reasons, U Maung Maung says, that 98pc of borrowers end up being women.“Because the household heads – mostly men – engage in main income-earning businesses, women staying at home could start additional income-earning businesses such as raising chickens, pigs, goats or establishing grocery shops or hawking that would earn some extra money to uplift their living conditions.”But it’s not just that men are already working: The chance that women will misuse money has been shown to be smaller, he said, with much lower risks of gambling or alcohol.“Impact studies in 2007 and 2011,” U Maung Maung says, “stated that microfinance is uplifting the living standard in terms of food security, better housing conditions, growth of investment and business, longer periods of children’s education etc. That is in very brief.”While U Maung Maung said PACT welcomed the 2011 law, he also pointed out that the regulators are necessarily new to microfinance.Indeed, governance is scattershot: Banks in microfinance are supervised by the Central Bank; cooperatives by the Ministry of Cooperatives; and MFIs by the Myanma Microfinance Supervisory Enterprise (MMSE), originally formed to oversee pawnships in 1952 but having undergone many changes of name and purview since then.Some have also argued that the law’s cap on loans at K500,000 limits aid if SMEs are big enough to need such funds but too small for regular credit institutions.Mostly, however, the concern about microfinance in Myanmar is that there’s not nearly enough of it. Lending with small amounts of interest means growth for MFIs – and hence microfinance generally – remains slow.While the UNCDF has pegged demand for microfinance in Myanmar at around $1 billion, in October 2013 the MMSE reported that the 116 MFIs then licensed held a combined loan portfolio of $118 million – not quite 12pc of demand.“Without significant political reforms in Burma,” Turnell wrote in 2006, “microfinance will more than likely continue the dismal tradition of financial institutions in the country – of a good and well intentioned idea, gone wrong in application.”The reforms, fortunately, have come. The problem now is how to catch up to the need.","/special-features/194-your-money-2014/11068-small-loans-big-change.html"
"301",301,"Who will get the nod?",2014-07-15,"Your Money","IT’S déjà vu all over again for those who remember the excitement of the 2013 telecom tender. With the Central Bank’s evaluation and selection process in full swing, Myanmar is holding its breath: Which of the foreign banks will be the first to receive the coveted licence to carry out at least a number of banking activities in Myanmar?           The criteria the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) is using for the selection process are still confidential. So, this contribution is limited to some personal thoughts only. Nevertheless, it is not so difficult to understand from the public record what the government is trying to achieve, and to match that with the pool of interested banks.On that rather limited basis, here are the big questions when it comes to determining which one of the foreign banks are most likely to be awarded the first licences.Will the winners be banks that already have a representative office in Myanmar?CBM officials have earlier indicated in press reports that the first licensees will be selected from the group of 40 or so foreign banks that currently have a representative office in Myanmar. Regardless whether that is indeed formally spelled out in the tender’s prequalification rules, I think it is fair to say that most of the banks with a keen interest in starting commercial operations in Myanmar will indeed already have a representative office here. The country’s remarkable democratic reforms and opening to foreign investment has not gone unnoticed. Since 2011, when preparations of the new Foreign Investment law were made public, 22 foreign banks have opened an office in Myanmar. So, one way or another we are likely to see the first licences go to banks that already have a presence or, perhaps, other significant involvement in the country.Which banks can best facilitate foreign investment?We know that one of the major objectives of the government is the promotion of foreign investment in the country. So, it is logical to assume that the government also approaches the issue for allowing foreign banks from that perspective. When you read the Foreign Investment Law, the Myanmar Citizens Investment Law and the Foreign Exchange Management Act, all recently enacted, you can easily infer a path to accessing foreign money.  In that regard, which banks would score the highest? There are two aspects to this. First of all, we need to think about banks which are strong in business banking rather than in retail. Which banks, among the list of banks with a representative office in Myanmar, have a strong corporate banking activity? Most of them do, but there are a few banks on that list which have a different focus.Secondly, is the bank strong in countries that are, or may become, major sources of FDI for Myanmar? From that perspective, FDI statistics for the pre-2012 period put banks from China and Thailand right at the top. More recent statistics of the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration place Singapore, Japan and Korea in leading places. Statistics are always a bit skewed – for example, a lot of investment is channelled through Singapore rather than originating from Singapore. And one thing does not exclude the other. One can easily imagine the government wanting to have at least one bank from each country that is a major source of FDI, so that investors from that country have a bank to go to. In that sense, one could argue that banks with a strong presence in ASEAN, Japan and China may have a bit of a leg up over some of the others. That being said, the EU and Australia are potential major sources of FDI. Standard Chartered Bank and ANZ Bank are strong in these regions among those on the list of representative offices.Which banks have experience with greenfield market entry in frontier markets?In the 2013 telecom tender, the government paid much attention to selecting operators who already had experience in emerging markets, who understand a new market such as Myanmar. It would be eminently logical for the government to use these criteria again. Not all the banks on the list of representative offices have a significant presence in emerging markets, or have greenfield experience. The Singaporean banks on the list, for example, have a presence in the large ASEAN countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and some have a presence in China, but their number of branches and their corporate banking profile in those countries differs quite a bit. Maybank from Malaysia is well known for its investment banking with larger regional corporates, and can also boast successful branches in the more pioneer-like countries such as Cambodia, Laos and Papua New Guinea.Does size matter?It is hard to tell how much weight the government will put on any one of the various ways a bank’s size can be measured. If we’re talking about market capitalisation, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd, ICBC, ANZ Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Mizuho Corporate Bank are among the largest on the list of banks that already have a representative office in Myanmar. Alternatively, one of the most common ratios used in the industry is the Common Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1). If that is taken as a standard, historically Singaporean banks are particularly strong in this sense. For example, OCBC and DBS have a CET1 of 14.5 percent and 13.7pc respectively as at December 2013. But possibly the size of a bank’s international network will carry more weight than its CET1. In that regard, Standard Chartered and ANZ which are present in 70 and 31 markets respectively, including in emerging countries, would likely score well –should they submit a proposal.Who are the favorites?As was the case in 2013 with the telecoms, Yangon is once more ablaze with rumours about possible favourites among the foreign banks. The three largest Japanese banks – namely The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Mizuho Corporate Bank – are, through sheer size and native access to one of Myanmar’s major rising FDI sources, in a strong position. Among those three, Mizuho Corporate Bank’s presence in Myanmar is of a later date than that of the other two banks, which might be a factor. Still, we think all three can be counted as favourites. The big three Singaporean banks and Malaysia’s Maybank all have subsidised a presence in Myanmar since the early 1990s. Now that the time has finally come for that investment to pay off, it is not difficult to imagine them putting forward an aggressive proposal. For this reason we must count them as favourites. ANZ Bank and Standard Chartered Bank also make the list because of their size, international coverage and experience in emerging markets. ICBC, a massive Chinese bank with an extraordinary financial basis, is sometimes mentioned as a natural choice in connection with FDI from China, which remains significant.Go big or go homeBut favourites don’t always run the table. In 2012, few people predicted that Ooredoo would win a telecom licence, but they did. Why is that? In my experience in Myanmar, there is one factor more persuasive than any other, provided bidders meet the government’s minimum threshold for technical excellence and financial track record. This factor is, I believe, more likely to determine the outcome of a tender than the bidder’s financial strength, technical savvy and international experience. That factor is the bidder’s willingness to go all in, to go further than his competitors in a market with important uncertainties.To win in Myanmar, then, it’s basically “no guts, no glory”. We have seen this with telecom, airports, oil and gas, and SEZ development. The bidder who is willing to commit more capital and resources than the competitors, to hire more staff, to take on more risk is very often the one most likely to win. In that sense it is fair to say that, regardless of size, network or past experience, most banks with a presence in Myanmar have a chance to receive a licence.But who will seize that chance? This is hard to gauge, especially since banking is usually a risk-averse profession. Who among the banks has a board that is supportive of a gutsy business plan in a highly unpredictable regulatory environment?We are about to find out.Edwin Vanderbruggen is a partner with VDB Loi, a leading Myanmar legal advisory firm.","/special-features/194-your-money-2014/11025-who-will-get-the-nod.html"

Alongside British troops, Indian moneylenders called Chettiars – members of an ethnic group specialising in finance – arrive. In the coming century, Chettiars would spread as far as British India did, introducing many lending and bookkeeping innovations and employing the hundi system of informal remittance. By 1930 there were 1650 offices country-wide, making them the primary financial movers of Burma under British rule, more important than any official financial entity prior to World War II.1852Second Anglo-Burmese War.

Denominations are 1 pe, 1 mu (2 pe), 1 mat (4 pe), 5 mu (10 pe), and 1 kyat (which was par with 1 Indian rupee, the British currency of choice and probably the first paper money used in the country). The reverse of the coins bears the royal peacock seal, leading the British to call them “peacock rupees”.1861Indian Presidency Bank of Bengal opens Yangon branch.1869Suez Canal opens, halving the time it takes to ship to Europe and placing Burma in the perfect geographic spot to supply rice to the Empire.1876In most areas in Burma there is no tradition of land ownership in the Western sense.Burma Land and Revenue Act issued to accelerate agricultural expansion as well as earn income for Empire: Occupiers are allowed to own land after making 12 years of payments.1885Third Anglo-Burmese War.

Rupee fully replaces kyat.1897Government of India alters Burma rupee design to incorporate Burmese lettering.1900Burma is by now the richest country in Southeast Asia.First local bank opens, in Akyab (now Sittwe).1905In part to stem the influence of the Chettiars, a formal system co-operative credit is introduced, growing to 4000 societies by 1929, though ultimately failing due to problems of implementation.1914Burma Companies Act lays foundations for individuals wishing to set up companies.1923Burma becomes a largely self-governing province within British India.1920s and 1930sChettiars are targeted by anti-colonial backlash and their influence declines, despite their important role in building Burma’s rice dominance.Co-operative societies rise, to supplant the Chettiars with a formal credit system, but prove sounder in notion than in implementation. As the Chettiars decline, no adequate substitute remains in their place.The Depression, which sends countries worldwide into a decade of severe economic downturn, also hits Southeast Asia and Burma. Rice prices are driven downward and farmers struggle.1937April 1 – The Government of Burma Act separates Burma from India and establishes an independent parliamentary government. Currency and banking issues remain solely controlled by British-appointed Governor. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is assigned to serve as central bank for two countries simultaneously.1938May-June – Following orders that bank notes “of distinctive design” be issued by the RBI (without Burmese involvement), the 5 rupee note is released in May and the 10 rupee note in June, with English, Burmese and Shan writing on them.1939July – Burmese rupees issued for 5, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, denominations, with King George VI on one side and peacocks, elephants, tigers, boats or ox-carts on the reverse. They are legal in Burma only, not India, though Indian rupees continue to circulate in Burma as well, and Burmese notes flow to India for RBI exchange there, constantly draining the local supply.1941Prior to Japanese invasion 24 commercial “exchange banks” operate in Burma, most headquartered elsewhere, including Lloyds, HSBC, Thomas Cook and Son, Bank of China, National City Bank of New York (now CitiBank)1942March 7 Japan takes Rangoon. Banks had begun making duplicates of records months before; holdings shipped to Calcutta; and a last-minute train evacuates staff and gold bullion up-country in February. One bank director buries gold and jewels underground in Maymyo. Another, having missed the train, walks out to India carrying his. Indian moneylenders also flee.Japanese military rupees are issued, divided in 100 cents and only in paper form. The following year these are replaced by a short-lived Japanese revival of the kyat.1945World War II ends. Japan is driven out of Burma by British and Allies, who refuse to honour Japanese-issued currency, leaving many with worthless paper. The rupee is revived.1946January – Foreign banks re-enter and re-open in Burma.1947April 1 – Burma Currency Board (shortlived precursor to the Central Bank) is established to mediate exchange of local and foreign currencies, though headquartered in London.Newly drafted constitution states “the economic life of the Union shall be planned”, setting pace for centralised economy with preference for “co-operative and similar economic organizations”. Capitalism is seen as hand-in-hand with imperialism.1948January 4 – Independence. Civil war puts economic reform on back burner.Land Nationalisation Act (later revised in 1953) implements constitution’s statement that “The State is the ultimate owner of all lands”.The British-imposed Indian rupee is replaced by Burma’s own currency (also called rupee), with one Burma rupee equal to 16 pe and each pe equal to four pya.1949Coins are introduced for pe and pya denominations, with a chinthe lion-dragon on the back.1952Korean War boosts rice prices, swelling coffers. Country shifts to program of “democratic socialism”, rejecting private foreign ownership and reclaiming control through centralisation.Drafted in part by US consultants contracted by Prime Minister U Nu, the Pyidawtha Plan, or “royal pleasant country”, aims to shift focus away from “colonial extractive economy”.July 1 – Union Bank of Burma Act disbands BCB, establishing the Union Bank of Burma as central bank. The kyat (=100 pya) replaces the rupee at par, with chinthe designs on back. Coins also later introduced for K1 and pya denominations.Following Indonesian model, a system of state-owned pawnshops begin, to prevent overcharging from private pawnshops. Three years later, State Pawnshops Management Board Order permits government to assume all private pawnshop licences as they expire, in part as a way to drive out Chinese money-lenders.1953June – State Agricultural Bank set up to extend credit through system of village and district banks, using “joint security” and programs of compulsory savings (both ideas are central to today’s microfinance loans). Repayment rate from 1953 to 1962 is 98.7pc.1954June 1 – State Commercial Bank formed. The next year all government institutions are ordered to bank with it exclusively1956Coins introduced for 1, 5, 25, 50 pya and K1. In the decades ahead they would be periodically re-designed and eventually phased out as cost of living rises.1958October 28 – Following instability during protracted civil war with ethnic groups, Ne Win takes power in coup to rule as “caretaker” government, until surrendering power in April 1960 to U Nu once more1961October – Industrial Development Bank opens1962March 2 –Military coup under General Ne Win and his “Revolutionary Council Government” ends oarliamentary democracy era. 1947 constitution is suspended.April – “The Burmese Way To Socialism” is outlined in a tract of same nameCurrency production is shifted out of Britain, where it had been carried out during colonial and parliamentary democracy periods, to the then-also-socialist East Germany.1963February 13 – After nationalising the Burmah Oil Company’s assets in January, Ne Win proclaims that “Henceforth, no more private industry would be allowed” of any sort. A run on banks ensues.February 23 – Nationalisation of banks announced. Fourteen foreign and 10 local banks – from the Central Bank of India through the Upper Burma Bank – are renamed People’s Bank No 1 through People’s Bank No 24, with foreign banks given the lower numbers and local banks the higher. Military officers are appointed general managers. Foreign banks are paid the level of capital they originally brought to the country when establishing, but not reimbursed for earnings since. Certain banks are assigned certain areas of specialty (No 1 credit, No 2 savings, etc). Deposits can hold only one account in one bank; cannot deposit over K10,000 per month or K50,000 per year; cannot make over two withdrawals per week; must make minimum withdrawals of K5; and cannot take out more than 10pc of account at once.May – Ne Win tells attendees at a village meeting to “Work hard and put up with austerity for a couple of years”.1964May 17 – Demoniitisation: Starting at 7pm all holders of K50 and K100 notes are required to hand them in to collection centres. The law proclaims holders of over K4200 will be taxed as “indigenous and foreign capitalists” for having “unfairly accumulated the people’s money”, then given “amnesty or light sentences”, while “the innocent or honest savers and the poor” are given equivalent values in return. People turn away from cash and toward savings in gold or jewellery.1965People’s Bank of Burma takes over note production, issuing new designs.1967-69People’s Bank of the Union of Burma Act nationalises 15 foreign and 10 local banks and merges them.1970Remaining state-owned banks are merged with People’s Bank of Burma. No more private banks until 19921970People’s Banks No 1-24 and pre-existing state-owned banks are merged into one entity, the People’s Bank of the Union of Burma, following a Chinese model, to encourage socialism. Various pre-socialist banking laws are repealed. In 1972 this single bank entity is renamed the Union of Burma Bank.1972Currency production is brought in-country for first time, at a printing plant established in Wazi (in what is now Magwe Region), where currency, lottery tickets and national identification cards are reportedly still printed today.1974January 3 – Country renamed “Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma”. Revolutionary Council makes way for Pyithu Hluttaw (People’s Assembly). Ne Win governs as ruler of Burma Socialist Programme Party. Socialist constitution replaces system of 36 districts with system of divisions (now called regions) for majority Bamar group territory and states (for other large ethnic group territory).1975Single bank splits into a central bank (the Union of Burma Bank) and three others with specific areas of responsibility, governed jointly by the UBB and the Ministry of Finance and Planning.1985November 3 – Second demonitisation: Denominations of K100 and K50 (both having been reintroduced without fanfare after their 1964 demonitisation) and K20 are, after this date, no longer legal tender. Maximum amount for reimbursement: K5000. New notes – K25, K35 and K75 – are introduced in their place.1987Burma requests and is granted United Nations “least developed county” status.Sept 5 – Third demonitisation: K25, K35 and K75 notes are taken out, after less than two years of issue. No compensation is provided at first; later maximum K100 is allowed for trade-in, allegedly to let students return home from school – or, as some say, to get them away from political instability in Rangoon.Sept 22 – New bills enter market: K45 and K90. Many believe it is because of superstitious meanings of number 9. Whatever the reason, the changes make everyone work on a new column of the times table – and make the kyat totally untrustworthy as a savings vehicle.1988August – Student uprising leads to national revolt; subsequent crackdown leaves roughly 3000 dead. Ne Win subsequently resigns.Sept 18 – State Law and Order Restoration Council, or SLORC, takes over in a coup, ending BSPP rule and the socialist era.“Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma” renamed “Union of Burma”.“Proper evolution of the market-oriented economic system” is the second of four economic objectives printed in government newspapers daily – though the fourth cautions that “The initiative to shape the national economy must be kept in the hands of the state and the national people”.A number of important laws follow over the next few years, including Union of Myanmar Foreign Investment Law (1989); State-Owned Enterprise Economic Enterprise Law (1989), Private Industrial Enterprise Law (1990), and the repeal in March 1989 of the Law of Establishment of the Socialist Economic System (1965).1989Burma is renamed Myanmar1990National elections are held but results are denied as military continues “caretaker” rule. US imposes sanctions.Fourth state bank, Myanmar Investment and Commercial Bank, is set up to stimulate growth of industry and production.Military-run congolomerate Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL) is set up.July – Central Bank of Myanmar Law is passed to establish modern monetary policy.Myanmar Agricultural and Rural Development Bank Law is passed to tackle rural credit shortage. Financial Institutions of Myanmar Law is passed, defining four state banks’ roles but also allows private banks for first time since 1963, as well as foreign bank representative offices but no foreign bank direct transactions.The roadmap predicts eventual joint ventures to introduce foreign bank operations, and later foreign banks operating independently, though those processes would not proceed under SLORC/SPDC rule.1992Private bank licences are issued for first time.1993Primary government treasury bond market established (secondary market for on-trading bonds still lacking).Foreign exchange certificates (FECs) established in 1, 5 and 10 denominations to limit circulation of US currency. Mandatory exchange on entry for tourists at one-to-one rate of US$200 (later $300 in March 1994). Local citizens can also bank FECs, but face a 10pc “service fee” and can only withdraw in kyat. The compulsory exchange would end in August 2003 and the FECs themselves would be discontinued in 2013.1994Myanmar Accountancy Law passed.1995Asia Wealth Bank begins operations; prior to crash of 2003 and subsequent de-licensing it would be largest of not only private banks but all banks operating. This and some other banks were alleged to have connections to drug money – another major bank of the time, Myanmar Mayflower Bank, was reportedly known by some as “Poppy Flower Bank” before it was shut down – and money-laundering. Other banks – Myawaddy, Cooperative and others – operate with government backingNovember – First ATM, at Mayflower Bank (now defunct).1996Myanmar Stock Exchange formed.US sanctions expanded; EU sanctions implemented.Asia Wealth Bank issues country’s first credit cards.UNDP microfinance program permitted.1997SLORC renames itself the SPDC, or State Peace and Development Council.Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) set up.2001Asia Wealth Bank (now defunct) offers first online banking.Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, a G7 and OECD body, gives Myanmar “non-cooperative” status, meaning member countries were restricted in financial dealings as transactions could be proven not to be connected to opium production.2002May - Law to Control Money and Property Obtained by Illegal Means promulgated as attempt by government to respond to international criticisms of banks being complicit in narcotics money-laundering, requiring all cash transactions above K100 million to be reported.Myanmar Institute of Banking (MIB) founded as a quasi-department within MBA, providing banking training mainly from entry to middle-management levels.Late 2002The first-ever private sector banking crisis begins. After the informal money sector collapses due to overextending its rates of return on loans, runs on the banks follow and the meager liquidity support offered by Central Bank is unable to prevent what becomes a major economic crash leading into 2003.2003National financial crisis boils over. Some banks penalised by government in aftermath. Ironically, the kyat gains strength in black market exchange, as non-banked money becomes a suddenly valuable commodity.November – FATF, then US and EU, further restricts international transactions with Myanmar banks, due to possible money-laundering complicity. AWB and Mayflower are singled out especially. After AWB and Mayflower are shut down (and later the Myanmar Universal Bank is absorbed into Myanma Ecconomic Bank), the private bank landscape looks significantly different, with other banks later rising to take top slots.2005November – Nation’s capital shifted from Yangon to Nay Pyi Taw.2006June 3 – Central Bank moves to Nay Pyi Taw.October – FATF removes Myanmar from its “non-cooperative” status list.2007August 15 – “Saffron Revolution” uprising begins. Touched off by SPDC’s removal of fuel subsidies which caused fuel prices to increase as much as 66pc and CNG bus fuel to rise fivefold in less than a week, as well as longer-term rises in the costs of basic goods like rice, eggs and cooking oil, the protest involves students, activists and the general public but took its name from the monks who got involved August 18. The resulting crackdown brings international condemnation. US, Canada, Australia and others impose tightest possible sanctions, while EU steps up measures as wellKyat drops to K1300 to $1 on black market (official exchange rate remains K6 to $1).2008May 2 – At 12:00 UTC, Cyclone Nargis makes landfall in Ayeyarwady Region. It eventually kills over 100,000 and leaves the delta – and rice crops – decimated. International community brings help but criticises government for not allowing aid workers and supplies inside.May 10 – In a nationwide referendum (cyclone-hit areas are polled later), a new constitution is passed by an overwhelming percentage, though scepticism arises over voting numbers.2009ASEAN Comprehensive Agreement. Myanmar agrees to open to regional foreign banks by 20152011March 30 – U Thein Sein sworn in as president; civilian government takes office.Auditor General of Union Law passed.Myanmar Payment Union (MPU), a Central Bank initiative, is formed to reform payment system, sets up ATM network.October – Private banks allowed to open foreign exchange counters.November 30 – Microfinance Law legalises microfinance operations, introduces interest rate caps.2012US, UK, EU sanctions eased; World Bank gets involved; Visa, MasterCard, Western Union arriveApril – Foreign Exchange Management Law lifts restrictions on transactions on exports and imports of goods and services.August 10 – Foreign Exchange Management Law introduces managed float system.November 2 – Foreign Investment Law allows 5-year tax holiday with various reliefs and customs duty relief; non-nationalisation and non-suspension of the business; land use up to 70 years (50+10+10); repatriation of profits and capital brought in.2013January 27 – World Bank and Asian Development Bank clear $900 million debt via a bridge loan from Japan Bank for International Cooperation; Japan, Norway and others also agree to forgive loans. President later announces over $6 billion in old foreign debt has been cleared, the first step on way to Myanmar leaving behind UN “least developed country” status, and making way for new aid that will kickstart economic growth.March – Abolishment of FECs announced.May – CBM signs Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Tokyo Stock Exchange to establish stock exchange in Myanmar by 2015.July 12 – Central Bank of Myanmar Law (revised) separates CBM from Ministry of Finance, granting it autonomous power to implement monetary and exchange rate policies.July 31 – Securities Exchange Law moves to establish a stock exchange, securities exchange companies, and counter markets for the accumulation and allocation of financial resources; also to reduce speculation in securities which fuels inflationAugust 5 – Interbank foreign exchange market opens.November – Financial Institutions of Myanmar Law revision aims to install more efficient banking system.2014A new Banking and Financial Institutions Law reaches the final stage of drafting.Process begins to allow 5-10 foreign banks to operate later in year.2015ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) set to link region’s economies.Yangon Stock Exchange to launch.National elections to be held.A word on sourcesThis timeline could not have been assembled without the invaluable history of Myanmar’s economy, Sean Turnell’s Fiery Dragons: Banks, Moneylenders and Microfinance in Burma (2009).

"304",304,"Active black market discourages foreign firms, says minister",2014-07-07,"Business","The prominence of the domestic black market continues to discourage prospective foreign investors from entering the country, according to Minister of Commerce U Win Myint.          Foreign firms are worried that black market goods are often sold at unfairly low prices because importers avoid paying import duties and taxes as well as following proper regulations, and in many instances the products are counterfeit.U Win Myint said the ministry’s mobile enforcement teams are crucial to stemming the flow of illegally imported and counterfeit goods and improving the domestic business environment.“If not, the country’s trade will not increase and foreign investors will not trust the market and not come and invest,” he said on June 21 at his Yangon office.Mobile enforcement teams have been sent to target Yangon’s main sea and airports this month, after previously focusing on illegal land border trade. The teams are known partly for suppressing the black market trade in liquor in December 2013, which resulted in an alcohol shortage on many Yangon shelves.U Win Myint’s comments come as some large international firms have raised concerns about goods being illegally sold in Myanmar.Officials from Japanese manufacturer Canon Inc said they are holding off on setting up a Myanmar production facility until Intellectual Property (IP) laws are enacted and enforced.Analysts generally regard Myanmar’s intellectual property environment as quite weak, with a full set of modern laws on patents, trademarks, industrial designs and copyright still not yet passed by parliament. Enforcement of existing rules has also been flagged as an issue.Canon products such as ink cartridges are being widely imitated on a wholesale level in Myanmar, getting in the way of future investment, said Inez Siantar, a Singapore-based Canon representative at a Yangon press event on June 19.Canon’s genuine products are imported from China to Myanmar, and marked by a distinct hologram on the cardboard packaging, but imitations are readily available on the local market.“We see in Yangon often the cardboard box was made in Myanmar and the ink cartridges are [knockoffs] imported from China,” she said. “I think that’s terrible.”The firm began one local lawsuit on unlawful use of IP in 2010, and it still is not settled, said Ms Siantar.Daw Tin Ohmar Tun, chair of the ASEAN Intellectual Property Organisation, said that modern IP laws will solve many of these problems.Traders however say the black market comes about in response to unmet demand.U Myo Hlaing Swe, a trader from Muse on Chinese border, said that restrictions on imports of many goods meant businesspeople are encouraged to work outside the rules.“If there is market demand, businessmen will try to fill it in various ways, even if there are official limitations. In my opinion the government needs to put its trade policy in line with the country’s real situation,” he said.The Ministry of Commerce’s mobile enforcement teams seized goods valued at K17.5 billion (US$17.9 million) from November 1, 2012, through to June 26, 2014.Ministry of Commerce economics advisor U Maung Aung said the ministry has been keen to build a trade policy in line with international practices, and has been cooperating with the World Trade Organisation on a trade policy review.","/business/10913-active-black-market-discourages-foreign-firms-says-minister.html"
"305",305,"Sittwe economic zone in limbo as foreign investors get cold feet",2014-06-30,"Business","Plans for a proposed economic zone on the outskirts of Sittwe are in limbo, after international investors pulled out over sectarian violence in Rakhine and wider political concerns about Chinese businesses in Myanmar.          In August 2013 the then-state minister for planning and economics U Mra Aung, told The Myanmar Times that a feasibility report was being carried out on creating an economic zone at Ponnagyun township, some 60 kilometres (37 miles) outside Sittwe. The zone was a separate project from the widely publicised Kyaukpyu SEZ off the Rakhine coast, and ministers hoped the Ponnagyun project would provide a financial boost that could bring stability to the troubled region.But a source close to the study told The Myanmar Times earlier this month that the original plan had fallen through because the South Korean firm decided violence in the state meant the Ponnagyun project posed too great an investment risk.And he said a major Chinese firm which was also looking at backing the project had pulled out amid uncertainty about the position of Chinese business in Myanmar, after several high-profile China-backed projects were halted by the government.“The South Koreans didn’t want to go ahead because of the trouble and the Chinese were worried about the politics,” said the source. He added that although he believed the situation regarding China was beginning to improve now, the last two years had seen little government incentive for Chinese companies seeking to invest in Myanmar.Sean Turnell, an economist at Macquarie University in Australia, who focuses on Myanmar, said, ” “This is a very specific example of how the violence in Rakhine is now yielding very tangible economic costs.”He said the issue could be “a wake-up call” for the Union and Rakhine governments. “Vested interest – the loss of material advantage – is always more effective than moral exhortation,” he added. Rakhine is Myanmar’s second poorest state, and communal conflict between ethnic Rakhine and the minority Rohingya Muslim population there has left over 250 people dead and around 120,000 homeless.According to the U Mra Aung, the proposed zone would have provided up to 100,000 jobs in light industry. A key aim of the project, he said, was to re-dress some of the economic fallout of violence in the state.“Due to the crisis, investors from foreign countries are not brave enough to come. And because of that finances of Rakhine State are a little bit not okay,” he told The Myanmar Times last year.The new SEZ would provide reassurance to potential investors he added.However continued violence in the state – which as recently as March saw international aid and development workers forced to evacuate Sittwe after attacks on their properties – has done nothing to improve the state’s reputation in the international circles.The UN and numerous international organizations have raised serious concerns about major human rights violations against the Rohingya population in Rakhine, who are more commonly referred to as Bengali in Myanmar.“I have been concerned for a while of how this [sectarian violence] has had an impact on the broad reform ‘narrative’, hitherto somewhat uncritically accepted by the international community, but this demonstrates the dangers of a momentum fast developing in the other direction,” said Mr Turnell.China has traditionally been seen as more likely than many countries to invest in areas with poor human rights records. But concern over projects such as the massive China-backed Myitisone dam – which provoked so much public outrage that the current government suspended it just six months after taking power in March 2011 – has increasingly put off Chinese investors.Figures from Myanmar’s Central Statistical Organisation show approved Chinese investment between April 2013 and January this year was just $46 million, compared to $407 million in the previous fiscal year and $4.3 billion in the year through March 2012.For already-troubled areas such as Rakhine, that appears to be having a significant knock-on effect.However Mr Turnell suggested Chinese investors were unlikely to stay away in the long term.“I am less concerned about the Chinese investment – which was always opportunistic, and always willing to leverage any relative advantage. The fundamentals of China’s voracious energy and resource needs, and an episodically supine Myanmar right next door, won’t go away. They will be back,” he said.U Mra Aung last week said the feasibility study had been abandoned after international investors had pulled out. However he insisted the Rakhine state government had not given up on the project, and the government would push ahead on its own to draw investment to the site at Ponnagyun which remained earmarked for development as an SEZ.“We’ve already planned this and are going to announce the tender for development soon,” he said, though he said he did not know exactly when the tender would be made public. He did not comment on how the state hoped to draw international investors given the continued troubles.","/business/10835-sittwe-economic-zone-in-limbo-as-international-investors-get-cold-feet.html"
"306",306,"APR takes up the elephant dance",2014-06-22,"Business","As Myanmar continues to emerge from the shadows of isolation onto the international stage, engagement with overseas investors is deepening further.          There are some sticking points – the United States has yet to lift all of its sanctions, for example. But Ford and Coca-Cola are here, and nearly 1000 international businessmen and women visited Nay Pyi Taw last year when the country hosted the World Economic Forum for the first time.Contracted foreign direct investment in 2013-14 topped US$4 billion.Another US firm that is here is APR Energy, which signed an agreement with the government in 2013 to implement a power project. It’s worth taking a second look at this.APR, which counts former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and billionaire financier George Soros among its leading shareholders, was selected from among other international bidders to develop a fast-track power generation project in Kyaukse near Mandalay. Kyaukse is famous for two things: traditional elephant dancing, and for being the home town of former Senior General Than Shwe.When he was in power at the head of the military regime, a heavy industrial zone was established in Kyaukse – supposedly to provide employment, though its population is relatively small.Kyaukse’s industrial zone is one of more than 30 across the country. None of them has enough electricity – just as more than 70 percent of the population lacks a connection to the national grid. The country’s current power generation cannot support universal household use, despite the recent opening of hydropower and gas-fired power plant projects. In 2013, the Ministry of Electric Power was unable to exceed 2370 megawatts of electricity for nationwide consumption.To complement its longer-term plans for improving electricity generation, transmission and distribution, the government decided to conduct a fast-power generation project to cover electricity shortages in the summer. The solution was to establish a power plant consuming 20 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.They decided to put the plant in Kyaukse, with the gas to be piped there courtesy of the Shwe Gas pipeline project, which is operated by China’s state-owned corporation, China National Petroleum Corporation.APR’s bid for the Kyaukse project was the first time the American company had participated in a government tender. After it won, the company imported 68 of the latest gas-fired generators, worth US$1.4 million each (APR says it has spent between $80-100 million on the project).A team of US engineers and local experts manage the plant, producing 82MW of a total installed capacity of 103MW. The fast-track turnkey power plant was completed in just three months – but the generators will stay here for only 18 months, before APR Energy whisks them away for another project.U Win Myint, chief engineer of MOEP’s Thermal Power Department, described the fast build time as “very impressive”. “It’s the largest amount of electricity to be generated in the fastest period that we’ve seen in our 40 years running gas-fired power plants in this country,” he said.The government is paying $30.5 million to hire APR gas-fired engines, and an additional K700 million (about $725,000) to build the power plant.“This is not expensive compared to other gas-fired power plant projects. If you look at fuel efficiency and the capacity to generate this amount of electricity in a short period, it’s worth it,” said U Zaw Naing Thein, vice chair of the Supreme Group of Companies, the local partner of APR.According to the ministry, only 15MW from the APR gas-fired power plant has been distributed to the Kyaukse industrial zone and the rest goes to national grid. The official denied rumours that some of the electricity went to an armaments factory and to other semi-government owned factories controlled by cronies.“We just manage power generation. Distribution is not our business,” said an APR official.While it is not clear why the plant was built in Kyaukse, U Zaw Naing Thein said it was not a political decision.“There is no politics behind the fact that a US-based company took on this project fuelled by Chinese gas, or aiming to supply only the Kyaukse industrial zone. This is about America’s future investment. An investment deal with the government has proved to be reliable and smooth,” he said.There has been no statement about how much APR invested or expects to profit from its 18-month power project.Clive Turton, managing director for Asia Pacific at APR, said during the launch ceremony for the Kyaukse plant earlier this month that the tender process had been more transparent than expected and APR is hoping to expand its presence.“We are ready to invest in this country. We are going to establish new gas-fired power plants in partnership with GE,” he said. “Now we are discussing with the ministry several projects to generate 200MW of electricity with gas turbines.”","/business/10738-apr-takes-up-the-elephant-dance.html"

None of them has enough electricity – just as more than 70 percent of the population lacks a connection to the national grid. The country’s current power generation cannot support universal household use, despite the recent opening of hydropower and gas-fired power plant projects. In 2013, the Ministry of Electric Power was unable to exceed 2370 megawatts of electricity for nationwide consumption.To complement its longer-term plans for improving electricity generation, transmission and distribution, the government decided to conduct a fast-power generation project to cover electricity shortages in the summer. The solution was to establish a power plant consuming 20 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.They decided to put the plant in Kyaukse, with the gas to be piped there courtesy of the Shwe Gas pipeline project, which is operated by China’s state-owned corporation, China National Petroleum Corporation.APR’s bid for the Kyaukse project was the first time the American company had participated in a government tender. After it won, the company imported 68 of the latest gas-fired generators, worth US$1.4 million each (APR says it has spent between $80-100 million on the project).A team of US engineers and local experts manage the plant, producing 82MW of a total installed capacity of 103MW. The fast-track turnkey power plant was completed in just three months – but the generators will stay here for only 18 months, before APR Energy whisks them away for another project.U Win Myint, chief engineer of MOEP’s Thermal Power Department, described the fast build time as “very impressive”. “It’s the largest amount of electricity to be generated in the fastest period that we’ve seen in our 40 years running gas-fired power plants in this country,” he said.The government is paying $30.5 million to hire APR gas-fired engines, and an additional K700 million (about $725,000) to build the power plant.“This is not expensive compared to other gas-fired power plant projects. If you look at fuel efficiency and the capacity to generate this amount of electricity in a short period, it’s worth it,” said U Zaw Naing Thein, vice chair of the Supreme Group of Companies, the local partner of APR.According to the ministry, only 15MW from the APR gas-fired power plant has been distributed to the Kyaukse industrial zone and the rest goes to national grid. The official denied rumours that some of the electricity went to an armaments factory and to other semi-government owned factories controlled by cronies.“We just manage power generation. Distribution is not our business,” said an APR official.While it is not clear why the plant was built in Kyaukse, U Zaw Naing Thein said it was not a political decision.“There is no politics behind the fact that a US-based company took on this project fuelled by Chinese gas, or aiming to supply only the Kyaukse industrial zone. This is about America’s future investment. An investment deal with the government has proved to be reliable and smooth,” he said.There has been no statement about how much APR invested or expects to profit from its 18-month power project.Clive Turton, managing director for Asia Pacific at APR, said during the launch ceremony for the Kyaukse plant earlier this month that the tender process had been more transparent than expected and APR is hoping to expand its presence.“We are ready to invest in this country. We are going to establish new gas-fired power plants in partnership with GE,” he said. “Now we are discussing with the ministry several projects to generate 200MW of electricity with gas turbines.”","/home-page/in-depth/10804-apr-takes-up-the-elephant-dance-2.html"
"308",308,"Vietnam catches the fateful casino pox",2014-05-26,"Opinion","There was once a silly love song called “My baby does the hanky panky”. At the time I wished mine did, but she just loved to gamble.          It’s hard to fathom why anyone likes to sit in kitschy, neon-lit caverns for hours on end, nursing expensive drinks and listening to the inane banter of deadheads – while losing money.Almost everyone loses; except the casino owners, although recent financial reports indicate that their revenue growth has tailed off.The only ones really reaping consistent monetary rewards are the governments that license and tax gambling enterprises.Naturally, when their economies start to dip, as after the 1997 financial crisis and the 2008 banking crash, they turn to casinos as a means to top up the coffers.In places like Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines, which already have several casinos, they encourage expanded operations.In Singapore and Vietnam, which formerly castigated casinos as dens of iniquity and hotbeds of organised crime, they have done a prompt about-face – not difficult for politicians, of course. They now tout casinos as revenue-generators that can pay for socially beneficial programs, which naturally will bolster the government’s popularity and help it stay in power. And while the criminal side and other bad stuff cannot be completely eliminated, local citizens can be protected by curtailing their access to gambling centres.So, three years ago, Singapore went ahead and opened two gargantuan gambling palaces, Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa. Soon after, Vietnam followed suit with multi-billion dollar casino resorts at Ho Tram and South Hoi An, plus dozens of smaller ones from Phu Quoc in the south to Lao Cai on the Chinese border.And just as Singapore has relaxed its rules for domestic punters, so Vietnam’s National Assembly is currently re-evaluating laws banning locals from entering casinos.In doing so, Hanoi’s assemblymen would be wise to note how the advent of casinos has damaged Singapore’s once cherished image as a squeaky clean, crime-free and unblemished society.Yes, it was all a myth, but it was a brilliantly conceived myth whereby the world was led to believe that gambling, drugs, prostitution, extortion and money-laundering did not exist in Singapore.Not anymore. You don’t need to be Dick Tracy to spot the young hookers lining up at Changi immigration and later sashaying out of the Marina Bay and Harbourfront MRT stations. Nor do you need to be Keith Richards to sniff the sweet musky odour of marijuana outside the nearby pubs and clubs.As if replicating Singapore’s ongoing difficulties were not bad enough, Hanoi’s plan to generate oodles of dosh from its burgeoning casinos has suddenly hit a major stumbling block.The vast majority of punters at Vietnam’s casinos are from mainland China, which does not permit casinos within its own borders.Unfortunately, after Beijing’s decision this month to send an offshore oil rig into waters claimed by Hanoi, the latent hostility of Vietnamese toward their northern neighbours erupted in lethal violence. As a result, very few Chinese are now going to travel to Vietnam and risk being reviled and even attacked. So Hanoi’s heavy investment in casinos now looks like a very bad bet, which will bring all the social ill-effects while reaping little revenue.The regime would have been far better sticking with conventional hanky panky, of which there is never a shortage in Vietnam.","/opinion/10465-vietnam-catches-the-fateful-casino-pox.html"
"309",309,"Vietnam and China lock horns over SCS",2014-05-26,"National News","Vietnamese and Chinese officials have locked horns over a maritime dispute that sparked deadly rioting in Vietnam, with Hanoi’s defence minister on May 20 saying the neighbours have yet to reach any agreement.          Tensions remain high in the region after an eruption of anti-China rage in Vietnam over Beijing’s controversial plans to drill for oil in contested waters, in which angry mobs last week attacked hundreds of foreign-owned businesses, killing two Chinese nationals.China responded by evacuating thousands of its citizens from Vietnam, as relations between the neighbours sank to their lowest levels in decades.Vietnamese defence minister Phung Quang Thanh said the two sides had discussed the placement of the giant rig in the disputed territory and stressed the need for a “peaceful resolution” to the row during meetings.“We still have different point of views,” he told reporters during meetings of Association of Southeast Asian Nations defence ministers in Nay Pyi Taw, which were also attended by China.Informal ministerial talks were dominated by the South China Sea, which is also claimed in part by ASEAN members the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia as well as Taiwan.Last week leaders of the 10-nation bloc presented a rare united front by expressing “serious concern” over disputes in the waters, which are home to key shipping lanes and thought to contain vast energy reserves.Washington has also warned about the potential for tensions to escalate.ASEAN defence ministers had a “frank and candid exchange of views on regional and international security”, according to a statement released on May 18 after the meeting.Myanmar Defence Minister Wai Lwin told reporters that talks between Vietnam, China and the Philippines were “constructive”.“Vietnamese authorities understand that the situation can affect their economy,” he said, adding that Mr Thanh had insisted that “they can control the situation”.Fearing an impact on vital foreign investment, Vietnamese authorities deployed hundreds of security personnel in the streets leading to the sprawling Chinese embassy in Hanoi on May 11, restricting access to the neighbourhood and other suspected protest sites.The authoritarian communist regime usually limits expression of public discontent.But the violence and scope of the riots that left some 140 people injured and spread across dozens of provinces, appeared to have taken the country by surprise.Dozens of Chinese and Vietnamese vessels have engaged in repeated skirmishes near the rig, including reported rammings and the use of water cannon.","/national-news/10470-vietnam-and-china-lock-horns-over-scs.html"
"310",310,"Letpadaung workers released",2014-05-20,"National News","Two Chinese workers kidnapped and threatened at a China-backed copper mine in Myanmar have been released, after they were held by activists demanding a halt to the controversial project.          China's Wanbao, which operates the Letpadaung mine in the northwestern town of Monywa, said the two abducted 23-year-old contractors had been freed, one day after being abducted.""We are very happy that our two men have been released,"" said Wanbao official Cao Densheng on Monday evening, after activists and local people had called for a total end to work and threatened to harm the workers.""But we did not agree to any of their demands,"" he added.The mine has triggered fierce opposition from local villagers due to alleged land grabs and environmental damage, and has raised questions about Myanmar's reliance on investment from neighbouring China -- which gave crucial political support to the former junta.Wanbao, which runs the project as part of a joint venture with a Myanmar military-backed firm, said earlier the men were surveying a part of the mine Sunday when they were set upon by activists and two local monks, who later issued a death threat.A 21-year-old Myanmar national was also abducted Sunday but released the same day.The copper mine has been the subject of several protests by campaigners and local villagers, mainly over land rights and compensation.A botched raid on a protest at the mine in November 2012 sparked anger after police used phosphorus against demonstrators. Dozens of people including monks were injured in the harshest crackdown since the end of military rule in early 2011.Local people said the incident followed a clash between village residents and police on Saturday night.A monk from a neighbouring village, who asked not to be identified, told AFP the Chinese were held after they entered the area near the mine. - Call to halt mine -Wanbao said the demands escalated during Sunday, with the kidnappers finally calling for the entire mine project to be halted and threatening to kill the captives if people from the village were injured by police attempting to free the men.""Wanbao cares greatly for the people of Myanmar and we very much hope that this issue can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible so that our colleagues can return to their families,"" the firm said, adding that opposition to the mine came from ""a small number of extremists and activists"".The incident comes as China sent five ships to help evacuate its nationals from Vietnam after territorial tensions between the neighbours spilled into deadly rioting last week.During Myanmar's junta era the ruling generals, tarnished by mounting human rights abuses, were shielded from some international opprobrium by China's economic might and its UN Security Council veto.China in turn had access to Myanmar's abundant natural resources such as metals, timber and gemstones, as well as involvement in numerous hydropower projects.But observers believe the scale of China's influence helped spur the Myanmar junta in 2011 to hand power to a quasi-civilian government. It launched dramatic political reforms that helped to sweep away most Western sanctions.President Thein Sein in 2011 ordered the suspension of work on a hugely unpopular Chinese-backed mega-dam.In July 2013 the country revised the terms of the mine deal with Wanbao, in an apparent attempt to allay public anger over the scheme by giving the nation a share of the profits.Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is normally venerated around the country, was heckled by villagers last year after she recommended that the mine be allowed to go ahead.","/national-news/10431-letpadaung-workers-released.html"

Hong Kong – a Chinese Special Administrative Region – also plans to begin free trade negotiations with ASEAN in July, he said in an interview with The Myanmar Times.Firms from Hong Kong have extensive experience doing business in the China, the world’s second-largest economy, he said.“The latest development [in China] is that as it moves up the value chain, consumption will be affected as the demand for quality has increased,” he said. “There’s a lot of potential as a consumer market.”Mr So visited Myanmar last week to explore business cooperation and meet Myanmar officials.“Myanmar businesses can partner with Hong Kong businessmen, and through licensing and franchising, and without spending a lot of money, can crack open Greater China,” he said.Hong Kong is Myanmar’s third-largest investor, while ASEAN is Hong Kong’s second-largest market after China. Mr So said the investment promotion and protection agreement (IPPA) between Myanmar and Hong Kong should be completed soon, allowing businesses more certainty when making bilateral investment. A future free trade agreement could also help Myanmar businesses access greater China.Hong Kong businesses are particularly interested in Myanmar’s jade and jewellery businesses, as well as agricultural products, he said.Union of Myanmar Chambers of Commerce and Industry president U Win Aung said Hong Kong is the third-largest investor in Myanmar in terms of approved projects, with some 68 projects worth US$6.47 billion having receiving Myanmar Investment Commission approval.Hong Kong Trade Development Council deputy executive director Margaret Fong said the introduction of Myanmar’s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) law in 2012 spurred interest in the country.“All are very interested in investing in the friendly environment the new government has created since it introduced the FDI law,” he said.Bilateral trade has grown about 62pc from 2009 to 2013, reaching $152 million last year.","/business/10383-hong-kong-touts-entry-to-chinese-markets.html"
"312",312,"Myanmar showcases reforms, and capital, at regional meet",2014-05-12,"Nay Pyi Taw","Myanmar paraded its once-isolated capital to international leaders over the weekend, hosting a landmark summit of Southeast Asia’s regional bloc as reforms see the country strut onto the world stage.          Teams of local workers plucked weeds from manicured lawns while police practised security checks on convoys of proxy diplomatic cars in Nay Pyi Taw late on May 9, in last-minute preparations for the arrival of ASEAN leaders ahead of the May 11 meeting.“We are now fine-tuning, everything is ready,” government spokesperson U Ye Htut said.The summit is the first top-level function held as part of Myanmar’s year-long ASEAN chairmanship – a debut for the country, despite its 17-year membership of the bloc, because rights concerns during the period of military rule kept it on the sidelines.A new quasi-civilian regime that took power in 2011 has thrust the country into the international limelight, with reforms including freeing political prisoners and welcoming opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi into parliament.Myanmar has taken the ASEAN helm under the slogan “Moving Forward in Unity to a Peaceful and Prosperous Community”.But its first major diplomatic role is likely to be dominated by regional tensions after tempers flared this week between Beijing and ASEAN members Vietnam and the Philippines over the South China Sea.Hanoi on May 7 accused Chinese ships of attacking Vietnamese patrol vessels near a controversial oil rig in contested waters.On the same day, Philippine police said they had seized a Chinese fishing boat elsewhere in the sea.The sea is crisscrossed by strategically important shipping lanes and vast potential energy reserves.China, which claims sovereign rights to almost all of the disputed waters, said it was in the right in both cases.Beijing has long been the largest investor in Myanmar and was a rare ally during the country’s years in the diplomatic wilderness under the junta.But Myanmar should strive not to let its close relationship with China “mar its neutral and even-handed leadership”, said Simon Tay, chair of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs thinktank, adding that this would “not be easy”.In 2012, Beijing ally Cambodia caused consternation when it was ASEAN head by refusing to take China to task over its assertive maritime stance.Myanmar was forced to renounce the rotating ASEAN presidency in 2006 because of the military regime’s failure to shift to democracy.But it has skipped ahead of Laos to take the rudder this year, indicating an enthusiasm to showcase its revamped international image in the run-up to crucial 2015 elections that are seen as a key litmus test of reforms.Myanmar has won praise for its democratising efforts from the international community and has welcomed a series of global leaders, including United States President Barack Obama.“Both the country and the people are now enjoying a high level of political dignity,” U Ye Htut said.The removal of international embargoes has also raised hopes of an economic boom in the country, left impoverished after decades of mismanagement by the junta.Foreign firms, drawn by huge natural resources and an estimated 60 million potential consumers, are already dipping their toes into the market.According to state-run New Light of Myanmar last week, foreign investment created 90,000 jobs in the 2013-14 financial year.Rajiv Biswas, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the country was “one of the last great frontier market opportunities for many Western firms”, but problems including weak governance and poor infrastructure meant it was still a “challenging” business environment.Nay Pyi Taw bears the signs of the country’s evolving aspirations.The “Abode of Kings” rose out of remote scrubland after a sudden – and costly – decision by the military to shift the capital from Yangon to Myanmar’s parched central region in 2005.Unconstrained by conventional notions of scale or design, the city sprawled across the tropical hinterland in an architectural smorgasbord of vast government buildings and hotels, linked by lonely multi-lane highways.Once off-limits to not only foreign visitors but also the general public, Nay Pyi Taw last year hosted thousands of visitors for the World Economic Forum on East Asia and the Southeast Asian Games.Tending flower beds near the ASEAN conference centre, local labourer Ma Aye Aye Aung said the changes in the capital had brought electricity to her village on the fringes of the city – but little else.“Nay Pyi Taw has improved,” the 29-year-old said. “I hope our lives will also improve as the city develops.”","/national-news/nay-pyi-taw/10315-myanmar-showcases-reforms-and-capital-at-regional-meet.html"
"313",313,"Why smallholder farmers need our help",2014-05-12,"Opinion","As the leaders of Southeast Asia gather at the ASEAN Summit in Nay Pyi Taw to discuss the pertinent issues facing their countries, it is worth remembering that for every five plates of food eaten in the region about four are provided by the region’s smallholder farmers. These are farmers who own 3 hectares of land or less and depend mostly on household members for labour. They form the backbone of most Southeast Asian countries’ economies.          While there are numerous differences between them, such as crops grown and levels of productivity, income and government support, they share many commonalities. Despite their marginalised status in society, they achieve higher levels of labour productivity than large farms do. In countries which have successfully reduced poverty, such as Thailand and Vietnam, productivity gains by smallholders significantly drove this reduction. However, today many are still snared in poverty and they face a set of common challenges preventing them from escaping this trap.The biggest problem smallholders face throughout the region is lack of sufficient access to land and high land insecurity, which makes it difficult for them to boost their incomes significantly. Smallholders own a limited amount of land, rent land, or in many cases live on land without legal ownership, thereby making them legally landless.The number of evictions have grown rapidly in the region during the last two decades as land-grabbing has become larger in scale, legalised and systematised. The amount of land confiscated from smallholders totals millions of hectares in a number of countries. Land-grabbing has been facilitated by national governments changing their land laws to become friendlier to investors. While smallholders have challenged these land seizures through protests, lawsuits and petitions, they have been severely repressed. Although victories so far have been few, smallholders in many places have refused to back down and have become more mobilised and empowered.In addition, the crop yields of smallholders will be affected by the impacts of climate change, particularly the rise in number and intensity of floods, droughts and heat waves, as well as increases in rain variation. In many places smallholders have limited access to irrigation and struggle to find water to feed their crops if there is insufficient rainfall. They are especially vulnerable due to high levels of debt or little savings, so a season of poor yields can devastate them financially.Further, smallholders have difficulty accessing regional and global markets. Both international and regional trade has been inhibited by non-tariff barriers (NTBs). A number of products lack required certifications and do not meet food safety standards which would enable them to be exported. For example, Vietnamese poultry is not yet allowed into the European Union and the United States due to these countries’ stringent food safety requirements. Smallholders often have limited market information and may lack production technologies needed to meet these standards.Another problem is that farmers struggle to receive a fair price for their products, obtaining only a small percentage of retail prices. Limited processing facilities, poor logistics and shoddy infrastructure limit their products’ lifespan and market reach. Smallholders normally have a weak bargaining position in the market. Those in rural areas, particularly remote ones, often have little choice but to sell to traders and cannot dictate the terms of trade. Many smallholders who engage in contract farming with large agribusinesses are also pressured to accept unequal profit and risk sharing in these schemes.The positive effects of the region’s trade liberalisation have been limited for smallholders due to market access problems. Instead, processors, middlemen and exporters have accrued most of the benefits. Moreover, in some cases, trade liberalisation has actually harmed smallholders in the region, such as the dumping of cheapagricultural imports from outside countries, such as Chinese longan and garlic in Thailand.Preferential trade schemes, such as the Everything but Arms agreement, which enables least-developed countries to export certain goods without duties or quotas to the EU, have been designed to help smallholders. In some cases, however, they have encouraged land-grabbing. For example, in Cambodia companies have cleared over 100,000 hectares, most of it seized from farmers, and built sugar plantations on this land in order to export sugar to the EU.More challenges are on the horizon. Starting in 2015, countries in the region will together form the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) which, they hope, will enable the region to form a single market and production base and become better integrated in the global economy. However, if proper safeguards are not put in place, the AEC could reify or actually worsen the situation of some smallholders, particularly those in the region’s poorest countries.By eliminating tariffs and NTBs, the AEC removes important tools from lesser developed countries that can be used to strengthen their economies. Further, in order to attract foreign investment, governments of the poorer countries could be discouraged from regulating the behaviour of foreign and multinational companies, which could encourage further land-grabbing, and seek to lower labour costs and environmental standards.Therefore, ASEAN and its national governments need to do more to help protect smallholders’ interests and rights. Foremost, they must not buy into pervasive anti-smallholder mythology and instead realise that in land-constrained countries, which they all are, growth models must be based on the principle of inclusiveness. Past experiences of several countries, including Thailand and Vietnam, suggest that broad-based small-farmer-led agricultural growth rather than large-scale commercial farming has been more successful in boosting farm productivity, alleviating rural poverty and sustaining nationwide growth.Specifically, ASEAN can help by adopting the Food and Agriculture Organization’s guidelines on land tenure that discourage large-scale land acquisitions, harmonising regulatory frameworks and standards regarding food safety and nutrition, and creating an insurance mechanism that pools together collective risks of agricultural production in the region.Some policies that national governments could implement to help smallholders address these challenges include distributing communal land titles, making information about land concessions available and transparent, expanding the amount of irrigated land, promoting farmer cooperatives, doing more to govern contract farming schemes and including smallholders’ opinions during trade negotiations.One of ASEAN’s goals next year is to become a regional community.

"315",315,"Race begins for motorcycle dealers ",2014-05-04,"Business","Each week salespeople from at least two different motorcycle manufacturers approach Ko Tun Zaw Win to see if his three Mandalay shops will act as resellers for their brands, he said. He turns away most, but the other dealers are not being so picky. Two years ago only a handful of brands were available locally. Today the market is more diverse: Ko Tun Zaw Win said Chinese-made motorcycle brands alone may number more than 200.All that choice, though, may not add up to much of a choice at all.For a few thousand dollars, Ko Tun Zaw Win said, any entrepreneur can cut a deal with a Chinese factory to have a few motorcycles made and then import them into Myanmar under their own brand name.“Some of the companies don’t even exist in China,” he added.It is no surprise that entrepreneurs are so keen on the Mandalay motorbike market. As of late 2013, about 3.3 million motorbikes were registered in Myanmar, according to Road Transport Administration Department statistics provided by Ipsos Business Consulting.In spite of a continuing ban on motorcycle use in Yangon that is more than double figure for 2008, when 1.6 million were registered. And many more motorcycles on the roads are thought to be unregistered, especially in rural areas.In Mandalay Region, where nearly a third of the nation’s registered motorcycles put down their kickstands – and where Chinese brands make up more than 90 percent of what is available – the fragmented state of the sales market shows supply is still far from meeting demand.It is the lure of an emerging market that draws so many manufacturers here, according to Colin Kinghorn, head of the Mekong subregion and Indonesia for Ipsos Consulting.“Myanmar is going to be top priority,” Mr Kinghorn said, “as it is an untapped market.”This is especially true for Japanese brands, he said. Japanese motorcycles can easily cost twice the price of similar vehicles from China, India or Thai brands, but they are perceived as being of a higher quality. Mr Kinghorn suggests that growing affluence among consumers in the coming years coupled with local manufacturing of Japanese brands will likely lead to a shift in the market.“There’s going to be lots more pressure on Chinese brands,” he said.Suzuki, Honda and Yamaha Thailand are all thought to be looking at producing motorcycles in the country. In Mandalay the expansion of Japanese brands will come from people like Ko Nay Lin Oo, head of Swift Investment and Trading Group, an importer and distributor of Suzuki motorcycles.His focus is two years down the road, he says, when he foresees rising domestic incomes, commensurate with GDP growth, leading to a shift toward Japanese machines.Acknowledging his motorcycles are more expensive than Chinese brands, he says the main selling points for the Suzuki brand are Japanese standards of quality, use of showrooms, genuine spare parts and after-sales service.“I think in a few years the market habit will change to a branded market,” he said.For now, however, shop owner Ko Tun Zaw Win says price remains the big concern. Resellers are racing to undercut each other, and with retailers unwilling to slow down either, competition is heating up for lower-end models. As a result, once-robust profit margins have declined significantly.Ko Tun Zaw Win is looking to pass the competition on the outside. He plans to move away from Chinese-made 110cc and 125cc models that currently predominate in Mandalay and focus on niche Chinese “sports” bikes instead.They’re more expensive, but they also offer a higher profit margin per bike. While the cheapest 110cc motorcycles sell for about K420,000 new, Ko Tun Zaw Win’s best selling sports model fetches K5.8 million.Others, however, are still fighting for market share at the lower end. Some manufacturers are even thought to resort to unscrupulous marketing, slapping a 125cc sticker on lower-market 110cc models and trusting customers would not be able to tell the difference.Ko Tun Zaw Win said vendors generally have no way to prove deceit. But he added that forming a motorcycle sellers association could allow vendors to push for government action at the borders to ensure imported bikes meet the standards their manufacturers claim.An association could also provide a forum for importers to order in larger lots from the manufacturer. That would transfer market power to the Myanmar vendors and alleviate some of the pressures of having so many smaller shops in competition with one another.Daw Thin Thin Ngwe, manager at Mandalay’s HiBoBo motorcycle shop, says her business draws much of its trade from agents who purchase from her in bulk and sell in Myanmar’s rural towns and villages.Her husband lives in Muse in Shan State on the border with China, where he scours the market for motorcycles for import.While the unstable kyat exchange rate leads to frequent prices fluctuating, offering a range of motorcycle brands to consumers is a key business strategy for HiBoBo. “I’m not worried about the future, because we have so many types of motorbikes to sell,” she said.Other retailers are working to differentiate themselves from the crowd in other ways. “It’s important to try to offer new things,” says Ma Tin Tin Hla, an employee at a Jianshan brand showroom on 62nd Street.The 125cc models are the shop’s best sellers, despite retailing for K530,000 compared to the K410,000 that 110cc models go for, she said. Hoping to continue the trend toward larger-engine bikes, the showroom now offers 150cc motorcycles as well, though at K1.2 million a piece they are a little pricey for many .While it seems Mandalay’s motorcycle business itself has plenty of room to grow, practical considerations may limit just how big the actual engines driving the sales are likely to get.Ko Tun Zaw Win said while he would like to see even larger machines on the roads, he reckons 300cc might just about be the limit given the state of Mandalay’s roadways.“Could you imagine a 600cc machine doing a U-turn on this road?” he asked, gesturing to the heavily trafficked 62nd Street, one of the city’s main arteries. “I can’t.”","/business/10240-race-begins-for-motorcycle-dealers.html"
"316",316,"Banking system issues deterring border traders",2014-04-28,"Business","Fundamental problems with Myanmar’s banking system are deterring traders from using banking services in cross-border transactions, casting doubt on official figures for import and export volumes and revenue, industry sources say.           The only bank with branches in border areas is Myanma Economic Bank, forcing traders with accounts elsewhere, such as Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB) or Myanma Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB), to use MEB.Time-consuming manual fund transfers between banks are a major cause of delay, said a Ministry of Commerce official connected to the Myawaddy border trade. This has prompted import-export companies to use other informal methods, particularly hundi, an informal remittance system used by traders that works outside of the traditional financial system.A trader must have a bank account with sufficient credit before applying for an operating licence from the Ministry of Commerce, he said.“Some importers operate without enough cash in the bank,” he said, a violation of World Trade Organisation standards that he said the government should resolve before foreign banks begin operations in Myanmar.Sources say exporters have to send their own funds to foreign customers who want to pay through a letter of credit (LC) and risk losses through exchange rate fluctuations. Transfers from MICB or MFTB to MEB can take two days, which is inconvenient when urgent payments need to be made.Beans and pulses trader U Win Aung said the situation was worst at the Myawaddy and Muse border posts.An MEB official said the main problem was not the lack of linkages between banks, but a lack of trust between local traders and their customers.“Most of our traders have to show their product first so buyers can check the quality, but are unlikely to request buyers to put up the money,” he said.However, Central Bank policy requires importers to keep enough funds in their account to cover the cost of their purchases, while international banks allow traders to deposit half the amount of the transaction.“The Central Bank plans to reduce its margin, but not yet,” said an MEB officer.Commercial banks began offering LCs to facilitate faster transactions last August, several banking sources said last week.Six commercial banks offering LCs are authorised to handle foreign currency accounts, including Ayeyarwady, Asia Green Development, Cooperative, Kanbawza, Myanma Apex and Myanmar Oriental.However, commercial banks cannot extend their LC services as much as state-owned banks do because they need trustworthiness from foreign bank partners, depending on agreements they have signed, sources said.State-owned and commercial banks generally charge fees of about US$25 up to $20,000, and about 1.25 percent for larger payments through LCs for exports, while charges vary depending on the type and quantity of commodity.The Central Bank has yet to allow commercial banks to deal in Thai baht and Chinese yuan, the currencies mostly using in border trading, even though private banks proposed this last year, said Cooperative Bank managing director U Pe Myint.“That is a huge barrier to border trade,” he said.“State-owned banks have offered this service for many years, while we just started a few years ago. But we have extended our network and want to be allowed to do more.”","/business/10187-banking-system-issues-deterring-border-traders.html"

The Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) invited tenders for 30 offshore blocks in April, attracting interest from a total of 75 international oil and gas firms, but after the ministry released a pre-qualified list of 61 companies last July, only 30 produced proposals.The final list, which includes both shallow- and deep-water blocks, includes BG Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and Woodside Energy (Myanmar) Pte Ltd, who submitted joint proposals and won four blocks; Oil India Ltd and Mercator Petroleum Ltd and Oilmax Energy Pvt Ltd, who together won three blocks; and India’s Reliance Industries Ltd and Italy’s Eni Myanmar BV, who won two blocks a piece.“It took time as we very seriously considered each selection in the bidding process as top international oil companies were in the running,” deputy minister U Myint Zaw said during the announcement ceremony in Nay Pyi Taw. “We just wanted to make sure every step was transparent.”Among the list of those who submitted proposals but did not win tenders are Korea-based Daewoo International Corporation, US-based conglomerate Exxon Mobil, Thailand’s PTT Public Company Limited, Petro Vietnam and Canada’s Stetson Oil and Gas.Under heavy international sanctions, Myanmar’s oil and gas industry was predominantly run by Thai and Chinese firms, though such firms have since been removed from the larger oil blocks. As a part of the latest tenders, international firms must agree to joint ventures with a local partner, though those partnerships have yet to be revealed publically.“All the companies have mentioned their local partner in their proposals.

"319",319,"In the chair: Suan Teck Kin",2014-03-17,"Business","United Overseas Bank (UOB), a leading Singapore bank, signed financing deals for two natural-gas-fired power plants in Myanmar last week and organised a foreign direct investment symposium. The Myanmar Times spoke with UOB senior economist Suan Teck Kin.          Q: UOB has been in Myanmar since 1994. How do you see this country today?A: Yesterday, I walked from Parkroyal Hotel to Shwedagon Pagoda. In some places there was no pavement and in some places no street lighting. I saw teashop customers crowding around a TV. It was like Singapore 40 years ago. This country has a lot of catching up to do. Proper policies must be put in place and companies must be able to take advantage of the situation right now. There is a lot of demand for investment.Q: Apart from the challenges, what impression do foreign investors have coming to Myanmar?A: Obviously there is so much interest in Myanmar. We expected only 100 participants in our symposium, but about 300 are requesting registration. The foreign investors’ point of view is very positive. Myanmar is the last emerging market.Q: Reforms have been under way for three years now, but foreign investment is still lower than expected and big investors are not coming yet. Why?A: Investments have been promised, but not delivered yet because the system cannot take it. It takes time. But you need people to come first, and development and more investment will follow.Q: Current foreign direct investment figures are higher than actual capital inflows. How is it concentrated?A: Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) said FDI stood at US$44 billion. Chinese investment, meanwhile, is about $16 billion or so, but the concentration is mostly in oil and gas, and mining. That is why the government has really to be careful about infrastructure development and to set its own priorities and plan accordingly.Q: Some people worry about the political track and the 2015 election. Can political change affect economic reform?A: Definitely, politics is very important. Investors don’t want to find their investment has been suddenly nationalised. Strong institutions are needed.Q: Do we have strong institutions?A: You are starting to. These things don’t happen overnight. They take time, and experience.Q: Do you think ASEAN integration will happen or not?A: The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) will bring trade of goods and services, an integrated market, free movement of labour and investment. The official start date is 2015, but the free flow of goods, investment, capital and skilled labour has already started within ASEAN, though the free flow of services is still behind schedule. I’m talking about mobile banking, transport, insurance, legal services and accounting.Foreign lawyers cannot practise here because of the language barrier and the difference in legal systems. These kinds of barriers are not simple. But ASEAN is well integrated compared to the EU or the US or elsewhere.Q: How about the development of the financial sector?A: One thing you have to look out for is competition. There should be enough competition between companies, or some institutions will have too much power, and the people cannot benefit.","/business/9833-in-the-chair-suan-teck-kin.html"
"320",320,"Rice exports to double in 5 years",2014-03-17,"Business","Experts believe that rice exports will double to reach at least 3 million tonnes in the next five years despite posting underwhelming results thus far in the 2013-14 fiscal year. With Myanmar expected to gain access to new markets with the lifting of tariffs, rice farmers are likely to begin diversifying where they choose to export goods, creating more sustainability in an industry currently challenged by smugglers in China, said Myanmar Rice Federation secretary general U Ye Min Aung.“Myanmar is at the turning point of rice trading with the international market. For the past three or four years we have exported about a million tonnes of rice,” he said, adding that new markets will create demand for Myanmar rice that will see that figure will double by 2020.He said that with new trade policies in place, Myanmar will also need to build the appropriate infrastructure to sustain such a high volume of exports, including all-season ports, high-capacity warehouses and rice reprocessing plants, while increased foreign investment will bolster other needs such as irrigation, education and processing.“If we can solve those four problems, by about 2019 or 2020 we will be able to export about 3 million tonnes of rice easily,” he said.Economists agree that the 3-million-tonne target is indeed plausible, but will require both circumstances to trade as well as additional government funding to farmers currently struggling to turn a profit.“There is a big demand for Myanmar rice. We have chance to export 1 million tonnes of rice to China alone, but we need to produce much more quality rice and then need to meetspecifications demanded by the international market,” said independent economist Hla Maung.About 60 percent of Myanmar’s rice is exported to China through Shan State’s Muse border with many Chinese importers illegally smuggling stocks into their country to avoid paying tariffs. In dealing with such traders, local farmers have been known to receive higher prices, though buyers have recently begun withholding stocks importers are now offering less.Rice exports for the 2013-14 fiscal year will likely reach just 1.1 million tonnes, falling well short of the 1.6 million tonnes exported last year. Myanmar produces between 12 to 13 million tonnes of rice each year, of which about 10 million tonnes are consumed domestically.Nevertheless, the country’s agriculture sector has seen a lack of funding, both from international investment and government subsidies, and many rice farmers are forced to take out costly loans that neutralise most profits, said MRF chairperson U Chit Khaing.“To develop agribusiness, we need public-private partnerships,” he said.","/business/9872-rice-exports-to-double-in-5-years.html"
"321",321,"Reforms could put govt at risk of arbitration suits ",2014-03-16,"Business","Efforts by the European Union to push forward with an investor-state international arbitration agreement with the Myanmar government may backfire in the form of costly arbitral suits arising from new policies implemented on the back of the country’s expeditious reform agenda, experts said.          As of the start of the year, parliament announced it was moving forward with an ambitious schedule to debate some 40 legal acts and ancillary policies and by-laws, many of which are aimed at modernising business rules across all sectors, while simultaneously approving new amendments to existing legislation.“The danger of the system is that it exposes a government to the risk of claims arising from legitimate legal and policy changes,” said Jonathon Bonnitcha, a legal adviser in Yangon at the International Institute for Sustainable Development.“In other countries, foreign investors have used investor-state arbitration to demand compensation for new environmental regulations, tobacco control measures and for losses resulting from bank bailouts during financial crises.”The government is negotiating an investment agreement with the EU that would include international arbitration for investor-state disputes.While the EU has stressed the importance of the clause for investor confidence, Mr Bonnitcha said that the ongoing and dramatic policy changes of President U Thein Sein’s government could land it in hot water.“Myanmar is particularly at risk because of the process of legal and political change currently underway here. During this process of transition, many of the laws and policies governing foreign investment will change,” Mr Bonnitcha said.“For example, new environmental regulations will be introduced, and the terms of investment contracts awarded by the previous government will need to be renegotiated on an arm’s-length basis,” he said“These are the types of government actions that have led to investor-state arbitral claims in the past.”Trade analyst Christopher Knight, CEO of Singapore-based commercial consulting firm Everett Knight, said that Myanmar’s vulnerabilities under an investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism could be controlled by careful wording of such agreements.“In general, an ISDS mechanism for Myanmar could be excessive given Myanmar’s current legal infrastructure and legal reforms,” Mr Knight said by email. “Depending on the details of the ISDS mechanism, there could be a potential that it could stifle the legal reforms through investors challenging legislation. “However, this risk could be mitigated by the details of ISDS, and Myanmar could include some provisions that create exclusions on how the mechanism is used.”One example of an investment that could potential trigger an international legal battle is the Myitsone Hydropower Dam project, as evidenced by 2011 comments by the Chinese partner company’s president. In September 2011 President U Thein Sein halted the Myitsone Dam project, being built by Myanmar government contractors and a state-run Chinese company, on the back of public pressure over environmental impact concerns.Environmental groups and experts had criticised the opaque and low-bar environmental impact reporting.U Thein Sein said the project would not resume during his tenure. At the time, the president of the state-run China Power Investment corporation president Lu Qizhou warned halting the dam could lead to legal action.In an interview with the China Daily at the time, Mr Lu said he was “astonished” when he heard news of the suspension as there had been no discussions between Myanmar and China before U Thein Sein’s announcement.“In February this year, Myanmar’s Prime Minister urged us to accelerate the construction when he inspected the project site, so the sudden proposal of suspension now is very bewildering.“If suspension means construction halt, then it will lead to a series of legal issues,” Mr Lu was quoted as saying at the time. U Thein Sein flew to Beijing shortly after to negotiate with the Chinese government.While legal action has not yet eventuated, community groups complain that small-scale work continues at the dam and on January 3 the Chinese People’s Daily published a special report calling for the contractually agreed-upon dam to be resumed.It is this kind of policy back-flip that could land the government on the receiving end of lengthy litigation, Mr Bonnitcha said.“Investors have been successful in many of these claims, which often run into the billions of dollars,” he said. “Even where a state successfully defends a claim, the cost of legal fees is normally several million dollars.”Ultimately, investors can not strike confidence in an investor-state dispute mechanism alone, said Mr Knight of Everett Knight. Investor confidence and a stable FDI arena was best bolstered by strengthening the domestic legal framework, he said.“For investors, despite Myanmar’s lack of legal infrastructure, FDI continues in Myanmar, so I don’t see that an ISDS mechanism would be essential in facilitating increased trade and investment,” Mr Knight said.“For protecting investments, the priority should be given to the ongoing legal reform and creating a legal infrastructure that is predictable, transparent, and functional,” he said.“An ISDS isn’t necessary in addressing those issues, and could actually counter it.”","/business/9865-reforms-could-put-govt-at-risk-of-arbitration-suits.html"
"322",322,"Can China and India coexist in Myanmar? ",2014-02-26,"Opinion","Risk analysts Daniel Wagner and Giorgio Cafiero on China and India's roles in Myanmar, and the complex geopolitical relationship between the three countries.          ""As in the past, so in the future, the people of India will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Burma, and whether we have to share good fortune or ill fortune, we shall share it together."" These were Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's words in 1948, on the day of Burma's independence from Britain. Since then relations between the two countries have fluctuated between friendship, neglect and outright hostility, yet India's rise on the international stage and Myanmar's ""democratic transition"" are forcing both governments to reassess the nature of bilateral relations based on regional geopolitical developments.India views Myanmar's emerging political transformation as a strategic and ideological opening that offers New Delhi an opportunity to dilute Chinese influence while expanding India's strategic depth. While India cannot expect to rival China's influence in Myanmar in the near or even medium term, it can have an impact on that relationship. In turn, Myanmar stands to gain from a stronger relationship with India on a variety of levels, whereas China views the strengthening relationship between India and Myanmar as a strategic threat.India has long prided itself as the world's largest democracy, as well as being a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement. At previous junctures in their modern history, both of these factors contributed to the dynamics that shaped the India-Myanmar/Burma relationship. Throughout the 1950s, ties were cordial, however the 1962 coup d'état in Myanmar led to a deterioration of relations. During the two decades of General Ne Win's junta, ethnic Indians were targeted, being viewed as ""privileged"" during British colonial rule. The nationalist wave that followed led to the expulsion of many ethnic Indians from the country. India pursued a rather disinterested and neutral policy vis-à-vis Myanmar throughout the majority of the Cold War. By the late 1980s, New Delhi began to play an activist role by sponsoring the democratic opposition -- seeking to establish itself as a beacon of democracy in Asia.New Delhi soon learned that such an idealistic approach to foreign policy did not advance its strategic interests, nor did it help the democratic struggle in Myanmar, as the repressive nature of the regime only worsened. As the military junta in Yangon grew hostile toward India, China became the regime's closest ally. India's approach to Myanmar's government subsequently shifted toward realism by 1995, as New Delhi accepted that the ruling junta was there for the long term. Thereafter, India became one of only eight governments in the world to sell arms to Yangon, underscoring the degree to which the bilateral relationship fluctuated since independence.Following the commencement of Myanmar's ""democratic transition"" in 2012, which led to the lifting of international economic sanctions, India's government and some of its private companies saw a strategic opportunity to influence the subcontinent's periphery. Indian firms such as ONGC Videsh, Jubilant Oil and Gas and the Century Ply-Star Cement group commenced operations in Myanmar. Total Indian investment in the country now approaches $300 million. Yet this is a small fraction of the total $43 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) that has reached Myanmar and the majority of its FDI continues to originate from China. While a decrease in Chinese FDI in Myanmar has ensued since 2012 the government in Naypyidaw remains dependent on China (and Russia) for its military armaments. Here, India is simply not in a position to compete, and probably will not be for many years to come--if at all.India's lack of capacity to become an influential trade and investment partner is driven by several factors, which include India's underdeveloped energy infrastructure, which limits New Delhi's capacity to transfer and distribute Myanmar's oil and natural gas in India, the reality that the two countries' mutual border is undeveloped, which contrasts with Myanmar's border with China, and bureaucratic hurdles and red tape that impede the cross-border trade and investment process.India has every reason to want to embrace Myanmar at this time, and to make as much progress as is possible on the trade and investment front. New Delhi's interest in integrating India's isolated northeast with the rest of the country will continue to provide Indian officials with an incentive to deepen economic, political and military ties with Myanmar. Yet security dilemmas on both sides of the border constitute major concerns for Indian authorities. For example, the Buddhist-orchestrated pogroms against Myanmar's Muslims have led to a radicalization of some Muslims in the region, which threatens to result in retaliatory attacks against Buddhist institutions in India and other corners of South and Southeast Asia. The Naga community, situated on both sides of the border, will also remain a concern for both governments as the concept of ""Nagaland"" potentially threatens both states' territorial integrity.From Naypyidaw's perspective, deeper ties with India can alleviate some of its own concerns about destabilizing developments on its side of the border, while also demonstrating that the country can balance its partnership with China along with other regional actors. Given Myanmar's economic and political dependence on Beijing, it should be expected that the government in Naypyidaw will only do so much, and with caution. Even if Myanmar's relationship with China does not fundamentally shift (and we do not expect that it will), India--and other countries such as the United States and Japan--offer Naypyidaw greater leverage against Beijing by emphasizing that Myanmar has other options. Chinese officials view the gradual development of economic, political and military relationships with India as a threat to Beijing's unique relationship with the country.Myanmar's government understands the value it provides to both India and China. India's security dilemmas and its interest in new sources of oil and natural gas will continue to drive its ambitions vis-à-vis Myanmar for the foreseeable future. At the same time, China's access to the Bay of Bengal via Myanmar, and the security of energy accessibility via its landlocked southern provinces, make Myanmar an important strategic partner for Beijing. Within this context, deepening ties between India and Myanmar will remain an issue for China.Regardless of whether Myanmar completes it democratic transition or retreats to resume its previous pariah status, its geostrategic significance and natural resources will continue to shape the balance of power in a region where Chinese and Indian interests intersect. China and India can indeed coexist in Myanmar, but China will maintain a distinct advantage by virtue of its recent history, the nature of its military assistance, and its alignment of long term interests with Naypyidaw.Daniel Wagner is CEO of Country Risk Solutions, Senior Advisor with Gnarus Advisors, and author of the book ""Managing Country Risk"".

"323",323,"Sailing stormy seas",2014-02-10,"ASEAN 2014","What’s the second-busiest shipping route in the world? Is it the China Sea? The West Philippine Sea? The East Sea?          All of them, actually, but what you call the body of water may depend on which coast you’re standing on. Likewise, your opinion on who owns it.Referred to in English as the South China Sea – in the sense that it borders China rather than belongs to it – the global shipping highway and rich fishery ground is believed to contain lucrative offshore oil and gas deposits.That makes it – along with the adjoining East China Sea – one of the most hotly contested areas of the planet, with claims having been laid over the years to some or all of the waters by Brunei, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.With eight out of 10 ASEAN nations having dipped their oars in the waters at some point; with Japan and South Korea also embroiled in the dispute; and with China flexing its naval might by claiming the whole area for itself, experts warn the risk of an open conflict is ever-present.MC Lall, a Myanmar observer from the University of London, said safely navigating these diplomatic shoals will prove a major test for Myanmar as ASEAN chair country in 2014.“I think this is one of the main challenges for Myanmar due to the close relationship with China and a more recent revival of a close relationship with Japan,” Ms Lall said.“Myanmar will not want to antagonise its long-term ally, and neither does it want to be seen as taking an anti-Japanese position, especially since Japan has been so supportive of the reform process.“The best Myanmar can hope for is to try to get a consensus position across ASEAN and then present this as the chair of that organisation, rather than it being seen as a Myanmar-driven position,” she said.The stakes are high. With each country drawing up the maps differently, no one – from governments to fishing boats to warships – can agree on who has the right to be where.Established by China last November, the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) now requires all aircraft in the zone to obey Chinese instruction or face a military response. And China’s Hainan Fisheries Law, effective last month, requires all fishing vessels to obtain permission before passing through Hainan’s administrative zone. ASEAN considers both measures in conflict with 2002’s ASEAN-CHINA Declaration of the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.For its part, Japan announced on January 28 it would rewrite its history books, literally, in order to emphasise that two island chains it disputes with China and South Korea are solely its own. Other countries have made similar shows of aggression in the past, only to be immediately and roundly condemned in turn by their equally assertive neighbours.Experts see potential for the war of words escalating into a war of arms – most likely between China and other countries in the region, but also possibly between China and the US. The two nations had a near-miss in December when a US guided-missile cruiser observing a Chinese aircraft carrier almost collided with a Chinese military vessel.“This diplomatic ‘test’ will show really how mature the Myanmar diplomatic machinery is, and many will judge Myanmar by how well they manage this issue,” Ms Lall said.Myanmar is well aware of the need not to rock the boat: In January 2013 it set up a group as part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specifically to keep tabs on South China Sea developments.And Myanmar’s spokesperson for ASEAN affairs, U Ye Htut – who also serves as spokesperson for the President’s Office and as deputy minister for information – has stated that the issue will be paramount for the country during its term.“Myanmar must show its worth by taking fair action without any favours to China,” U Ye Htut said on January 16. “The leading priority is to create a document of conduct on the South China Sea dispute during its chairship.”But while Myanmar “has vowed that its decisions are not influenced by any countries”, U Ye Htut also admitted other factors still need to be considered.“We need to solve this territorial dispute without damaging the relationship between Myanmar and China, because we can’t change our geographical situation.”In the past China has insisted on negotiating disputes with other claimants on a one-to-one basis, while ASEAN members, looking for strength in numbers, in turn demand to negotiate collectively. Joint talks toward a code of conduct began in September, and at the October 10 East Asia Summit – featuring all 10 ASEAN nations plus eight others, including the US, China and Japan – participants cheered the discussions as “positive progress”.At the first ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ retreat in Myanmar, held January 16-18 in Bagan, only the South China Sea dispute was highlighted in the follow-up statement. Other regional issues – religious tensions, ethnic armed conflicts, efforts to deter chemical weapons, the Korean peninsula, and deterring nuclear proliferation – were put on the general agenda only.In the statement, the foreign ministers jointly expressed their concerns about recent escalation of tensions, further reaffirming ASEAN’s six-point principles on the body of water and the importance of the maintenance of peace and stability, maritime security, and freedom of navigation in the waters and while flying above the disputed territory.Beforehand, some had worried Myanmar might, like Cambodia before it, be cowed by its dependence on Chinese foreign investment, and choose to shy away from the topic.“The issue wasn’t included in the agenda when Cambodia chaired [in 2012],” political commentator U Kyaw Win said. “It did not include it due to China’s pressure. For Myanmar, just including the issue in the agenda will work well for the country’s reputation.”“Most countries including the ASEAN bloc had been worrying about whether Myanmar can solve the South China Sea dispute fairly,” U Ye Htut said. “So Myanmar must show it can.”While Myanmar has said it will resist discussing “internal matters” which may anger or embarrass ASEAN members – including itself – it seems eager to wade into the South China Sea dispute.That may be because it is not itself directly involved: Choosing to focus on a regional dispute, rather than other domestic disputes which may show it in a bad light and can’t be solved immediately, may prove useful during its term.And if Myanmar can shrug off the influence of China, it will be cheered as a flex of diplomatic muscle and a vote of confidence for the integrated economy of the ASEAN Community to come in 2015.Should things go wrong, however, Myanmar as chair country has the responsibility to intervene. That means Myanmar’s first priority is to make sure the situation doesn’t get worse under its watch, U Kyaw Win said.“To decide right and wrong accurately [in matters of sovereignty] is difficult as the arguments are based on history. But Myanmar needs to control the situation so it doesn’t develop into physical war,” said U Kyaw Win.“The Myanmar government is not in the position to stop a war. But the government will try as much as it can to be able to reduce the tension. That’s all it can do.”Additional reporting by Sandar Lwin and Bridget Di CertoTranslation by Thiri Min Htun","/special-features/175-asean-2014/9536-sailing-stormy-seas.html"
"324",324,"Ooredoo and Telenor get licences",2014-02-02,"Business","After months of delays, the path is finally cleared for global Qatari telecommunications provider Ooredoo and Norway-based Telenor to develop a nationwide mobile network in Myanmar after obtaining operators licences from the government, officials said on Thursday.          The government announced in June that the two firms had won an international tender to develop and operate a mobile infrastructure in Myanmar, helping to solidify the quasi-civilian regime’s plan to open to the country to foreign investors.Since then, however, the issuance of an operator’s licence – which would allow the two firms to begin building their multi-billion dollar networks – has been delayed as lawmakers struggled to put a regulatory framework for the telecom sector in place.On Thursday, the government announced they had finally granted telecommunications licences to both firms, while Telenor and Ooredoo have pledged to launch initial services in cities such as Yangon in the next six to eight months.“The licences granted to Telenor and Ooredoo … have been accepted by both new operators and will come into effect on February 5, 2014, for an initial duration of 15 years,” Minister of Communications and Information Technology U Myat Hein said during a signing ceremony with Ooredoo last week.Sigve Brekke, vice president of Telenor Group and head of Telenor’s operations in Asia, said that the license comes following an “extensive consultation process” with the government and international organizations.“It [the telecommunications law] now represents an acceptable framework that we believe will go a long way to provide the necessary long-term predictability that Telenor requires when it formally starts operations in Myanmar,” he said in a separate statement on Thursday.During the signing ceremony held in Nay Pyi Taw last week, representatives from Ooredoo detailed their short and long term rollout plans. Mr. Ross McCormack, CEO of Ooredoo, pledged to begin selling “affordable” SIM cards in Nay Pyi, Yangon, and Mandalay by the middle of 2014.While low-cost Myanmar Post Telecommunication SIM cards are offered through a lottery system, the cards are quickly circulated into the black market where they are resold for as much as $450 each. Mr. McCormack said he believed the sheer volume of cards they plan to sell will be able to guard against such a secondary market.Furthermore, he pledged that 97 percent of the population will have access to their 3G networks by the end of 2018, in keeping with their contract with the government.Ooredoo has promised to invest $15 billion for the duration of its licence, which will last 15 years.With 60 million people estimated to be living in Myanmar, just 7.08 percent had access to mobile phones as of July, according to government data, while only 5 percent has access to the internet.“In the short term, as mobile networks are built, the investment and related financial flows, including license fees, will add to growth and improve budget revenues,” Matt Davies, deputy division chief at the Asia and Pacific department of the International Monetary Fund, told The Myanmar Times.U Than Lwin, economist, deputy chairman of locally owned KBZ Bank and former deputy governor at the Central Bank of Myanmar, said that developing a mobile infrastructure will not only give millions of people access to mobile services, but will pave the way for mobile banking, an alternative banking model that has been wildly successful in countries like Kenya, China and Cambodia.“We, as banks, will have more access to rural areas where no [banking] infrastructure exists.”During military rule, telecommunications were tightly controlled by the government, who held a monopoly over the sector, while mass communication was looked at as a tool for radicals to spread rhetoric that could lead to change.Despite Thursday’s milestone, analysts have said that several challenges stand in the way of Telenor and Ooredoo’s reaching their launch targets, including the acquisition of land to build the necessary towers as well as the formation of an independent regulator.“Operators working in areas close to Myanmar’s borders will need to compete with subscribers currently making use of Thai and Chinese SIM cards and networks that are likely to be superior to their own for the foreseeable future.” Tom Mowat, co-author of Myanmar Telecoms Market: overview and emerging opportunities has said in the past.","/business/9433-ooredoo-telenor-get-licences.html"
"325",325,"Early days for foreign investors",2014-01-26,"Opinion","For a country that was frozen in time for half a century by a repressive military junta, it is ironic that the government of Myanmar says change is not coming fast enough. But last November, officials accused the owners of a multibillion-dollar industrial project in Dawei of failing to attract foreign investors in a timely fashion.          Myanmar appealed to government officials and private investors in Japan to help restart the project. A local human rights group, the Dawei Development Association, warned Japanese investors that they risked becoming complicit in harming half a million minority residents in the area.Dawei is far from an isolated case. The Karen Human Rights Group documented thousands of instances of “abuse, destruction of property, pollution, theft, and confiscation of land” between 2011 and 2012. In northwestern Myanmar, local activists and farmers have documented the illegal seizure of more than 7800 acres from ethnic minorities to allow for the expansion of the Chinese-financed copper mine at Letpadaung.In the West, it has become common to view the newly democratic Myanmar as Asia’s next rising star. With 60 million potential consumers, a generous new foreign investment law that allows international firms up to 100 percent ownership of projects they fund in Myanmar, a five-year tax holiday, and 50-year land leases, companies from Coca-Cola to Chevron and General Electric are rushing to get a piece of the action.But the country is also home to the world’s longest ongoing civil war, which has raged between the Burman-dominated government and many of Myanmar’s 135 distinct ethnic groups since 1948.The problem for investors is that the vast majority of Myanmar’s most desirable natural resources are located in the ethnic-minority-dominated borderlands that surround the country like a horseshoe.Limited DemocracyMyanmar’s central core lies along the long, flat Ayeyarwady Valley, home to the Burman majority that makes up an estimated 69 percent of the population. To the east are the Shan Hills, the domain of the Buddhist Shan people.To the north and northwest are rugged mountains extending to the Himalayas and dominated by ethnic groups such as the Chin and Kachin, who are both Christian. To the west, on the border with Bangladesh, live the Muslim Rohingya – perhaps Myanmar’s most persecuted minority.Last October, a Buddhist anti-Muslim mob killed five Rohingya in the western state of Rakhine, including a 94-year-old grandmother who was paralysed from the waist down. A few weeks later, government soldiers gang-raped a 15-year-old Kachin girl. A week after that, the Myanmar army attacked a village and forced 2000 to flee, joining the half a million refugees in Myanmar and across the border in Thailand.In response, Western investors could attempt to operate only in major cities and steer clear of the resource-rich ethnic areas. In fact, many US companies reportedly remain cautious about making major investments in Myanmar’s rural areas, fearful of poor infrastructure and “political instability.”Fruits of FreedomThere have been encouraging signs of progress. Last November, the government and representatives of 18 rebel groups met for historic cease-fire talks that established a measure of goodwill and set up a renewed round of negotiations for this spring.One British diplomat told us that “everyone knows what the answer is – federalism.” Whereas some minority groups such as the Kachin still want outright independence, most hope for a system like Switzerland, where ethnic cantons have autonomy within a federal structure.Still, countries from South Korea to Ghana have managed to transition successfully from military dictatorship to democracy.Last year, for instance, Chinese investors appealed to Beijing to help arrange negotiation between Myanmar’s leaders and the Kachin Independence Organisation in support of a Chinese-owned pipeline expected to carry natural gas from Kachin State back to China.Mitsubishi, for instance, could review the existing environmental and social impact studies conducted at Dawei and insist on globally accepted standards before construction begins.Additionally, Western business leaders – perhaps together with the US Chamber of Commerce and other business associations – can take a page from the European governments and NGOs that taught capitalism to citizens of the former Soviet Union after the Berlin Wall fell and help develop ethnic minorities’ business savvy, educating them to compete in a globalised, free-market economy.“We know that one of the biggest incentives to find peace with ethnics is to get more foreign investment in,” David Tharckabaw, the Karen National Union’s foreign minister, has said. But, he continues, “We have to make sure that proper consultation is done with the civilians and everything is done in a sustainable manner which benefits the ethnic civilians, not just the government and foreign investors.”Stanley Weiss is a global mining executive and the founder of Business Executives for National Security, in Washington, DC Tim Heinemann is a retired Special Forces officer and a mobile training team leader at the US Department of Defense for counterterrorism professional development of US allies around the world.","/opinion/9379-myanmar-investing-do-well-by-doing-right.html"

Yangon has fewer than 2000 hotel rooms of an international standard, according to hotel and hospitality real estate advisory Jones Lang LaSalle, and demand is sharply increasing – along with the amount hotels can charge desperate visitors.Myanmar has set a target of attracting more than 3 million arrivals in 2015 and 7.5 million visitors by 2020, and the vast majority of these are likely to enter the country through Yangon airport.Just in the month of December, France’s Accor doubled the size of its Myanmar portfolio, announcing it would oversee three new properties in partnership with Myat Min Co. US-based Best Western, meanwhile, opened its first hotel shortly before the New Year and has a property in Nay Pyi Taw in the pipeline.For long-established hotels like Sedona, the new competition means expansion and upgrades are needed just to keep up.“When the dark days were up on us with low occupancy, there was no money and no incentive to develop your hotels because nobody was staying there,” said Tony Picon, managing director at real estate services company Colliers International in Yangon.“But then when you start to see people flooding in, as they have in the past two or three years, firstly you get more money but you also want to make your hotel nice ... Hotels are going to charge a high rate but they know they have to provide something in return.” HAGL’s $440 million complex has turned a roughly 8-acre swath of Yangon into what looks like a child’s sandbox, albeit one on a giant scale. Dump trucks and excavators, many of them brought in from Vietnam in February 2013, rumble across the dusty site day and night, illuminated by racks of floodlights.The first phase of the project, according to the company, will include a 480-room luxury hotel and a 27-storey office building. A second phase of apartments and more offices is estimated to be finished in 2016.Across the road, the Sedona, one of Yangon’s first international standard hotels, is watching its newest neighbour slowly rise, but is not sitting idly by.After receiving approval from the Myanmar Investment Commission in May 2013, owner Keppel Land broke ground in October on an $80 million expansion that will add 420 rooms, with an estimated completion date of 2016.Simultaneously, the older portion of the hotel is undergoing a $25 million renovation that will see guest rooms, common areas and food and beverage services upgraded, along with mechanical and electrical systems, said Ng Ooi Hooi, president of regional Investments at Keppel.“We believe that the Yangon hotel market still offers plenty of opportunities for early movers like Keppel Land. Sedona Hotel Yangon will remain one of the best hotels operating in Yangon,” Mr Ng Ooi Hooi said.In what is perhaps a bit of “keeping up with the Joneses”, Sedona’s new wing will top out at 29-storeys, making it one of the tallest structures in Yangon when completed – and two storeys taller than HAGL’s hotel.Sedona is not the only Yangon mainstay that has realised the need for expansion and improvement. Traders Hotel in Yangon, opened in 1996 underwent a major overhaul in 2010.“Not only was there an investment in hardware, a significant part of the work has included training, developing and grooming local Myanmar people for the industry as it grows,” Phillip Couvaras, general manager of Traders Yangon, said of the upgrade.An office tower being developed by Shangri-La, which operates Traders, is under construction adjacent to the hotel. Mr Couvaras said that the new tower and the existing hotel will be linked by a shopping centre.Just up the road from Traders, Parkroyal Hotel is undergoing extensive renovations as well.

Its Chinese restaurant, Phoenix Court, will re-open this month after also being overhauled.Spokesperson Michelle Win said the hotel is also undertaking extensive renovations to its lobby that are scheduled for completion this month.The changes come after its high-end Orchid Club rooms and accompanying business facilities got a facelift last year.As with the developments being undertaken by Traders and Sedona, Parkroyal’s upgrades make perfect sense, Mr Picon said.“These are hotel people and they will upgrade their hotels when the time is right.

"328",328,"Electricity problems persist despite progress",2014-01-05,"Business","Despite increased investment in Myanmar’s electricity sector in 2013, including by international financial institutions, sustainable development remains a challenge. Only 26 percent of the population has access to government electricity supplies, government figures say, while in the past year new projects to increase production and a proposal of price hikes to reduce consumption and bring sustainability brought controversy at every stage.           The nation’s energy woes were outlined in its first-ever comprehensive energy report, released in June at the World Economic Forum. At the forum, which was being held in Myanmar for the first time, a broad range of topics were discussed by national and international industry leaders, businesspeople and government officials – including the country’s present and future energy needs.According to New Energy Architecture: Myanmar, even with electricity production doubling annually it would take five years to meet today’s level of demand. In that time, the report noted,demand would continue to grow by 12pc every year.International energy experts recommend the country prioritise natural gas-fired power plants to support urgent electricity demand, and the Ministry of Electric Power signed agreements with foreign companies for six gas-fired power plant projects in early 2013.Some foreign firms have also been given permission to run feasibility studies to consider the effects of rejuvenating ten ageing gas-fired power plants to improve electricity production.As the report makes clear, however, natural gas alone can’t supply the whole answer to the country’s energy problems. Current offshore gas fields are already engaged for long-term exports to China and Thailand, while new discoveries will take several years to reach production stage.Currently, only a small portion of natural gas is supplied to domestic use. The country needs 700 million cubic feet (mcf) of natural gas daily but only 300mcf is supported, according the energy report.Local and foreign private companies have invested US$270 million developing four privately run gas-fired power plants in the Yangon area. While the plants are ready to produce electricity, production has been delayed as the power purchasing agreement (PPA) is yet to be completed between the Ministry of Electric Power and the companies involved.“The private companies are expecting to sell electricity at K120 per unit once the PPA is signed,” said U Zaya Thura Mon, CEO of Myanmar Central Power Company.The hold-up in production is due to delays in drafting a new electricity law, which will regulate private electricity production and distribution. That law is being written by the electricity ministry with the help of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, though both international finance institutions have since left the process for unknown reasons.Several major hydropower projects got underway in 2013, with the government announcing early in the year that dams will be built on the Salween River. Projects in Shan State are at Kwanlon, with an install capacity of 1400 megawatts; Naungpha, with 1000MW; Manntaung, with 200MW; and Mainton, with 7110MW capacity. Kayah State’s Ywarthit will produce 4000 MW, while Hatkyiin Kayin State will produce 1360MW.As with the controversial Myitsone dam project – put on hold in 2011 by President U Thein Sein (to be debated again after the end of his government’s term in 2015) – opposition to the Salween River projects has been fierce. Residents and civil societies have called for the projects to be halted, voicing concerns over social and environmental issues.Another criticism of the Salween projects is that – as with the shelved Myitsone dam – the government plans to sell the electricity to other nations, in spite of a major energy deficit at home.The electricity ministry has signed agreements hydropower dams with five Chinese companies, one Thai company and three local firms.Four hydro-power projects have been halted around the country, and coal-fired power plant projects are also being condemned by the public, Minister of Electric Power U Khin Maung Soe said in September.On November 13 he announced that 2014’s hot season will see electricity demands in areas where electricity is already provided rise to 2370MW – 715MW above the current maximum electricity production level of 1655MW.“The ministry is trying to increase [production levels] 202MW with hydro power plants which are still under construction and 259.1MW from gas-fired power plants,” U Khin Maung Soe said.But with electricity shortages still expected in the medium term, the government announced at the end of October that they would raise prices 43pc for certain household consumers, but delayed the hike until April after backlash from the public and parliament.While the public argued against the rate hike, some experts said increases would be needed for financial sustainability, as the power supply is costing the government K185 billion (about US$190 million) a year.“The government would require a greater amount of tariffs or subsidies in order to ensure the financial viability of the power sector,” Kim Jong Inn, an energy specialist with Asian Development Bank (ADB), said in November.In September the World Bank announced a US$140 million loan to Myanmar’s electricity sector. The loan will help rebuild an old gas-fired power plant in Mon State. In early December ADB announced a $60 million loan to update electricity transmission infrastructure in Yangon, Mandalay, Sagaing and Magwe regions.Of 396 cities in Myanmar, 224 cities, or 57pc, have access to electricity. Of the country’s 60,000 villages, less than 20,000 – or one-third – have electricity. In total, according to the Ministry of Electric Power, only around 26pc of the population of Myanmar have access to electricity.","/business/9182-electricity-problems-persist-despite-progress.html"
"329",329,"Putting a roof over your head",2013-12-02,"Building For the Future","Not just an expression of style, the roof is a vital consideration for choosing a new home           Looking for a good foundation for your home? Don’t look down, roofing experts say, look up: The aesthetics, insulation and weather-proofing of your household all start with a good roof.Fortunately for homeowners, options have expanded dramatically over the past few years, with more materials and colours available than ever before.While the good news is that there’s something for every price range, the choices can sometimes be overwhelming. That’s why, whether building or renovating, it’s always best to consult architects and decorators on what kind of roofing material will best complement your budget and the overall design of your home’s exterior.As with any purchase, of course, it’s also easier to make the right choice if you’ve done some research ahead of time about what’s on the market.The most popular choice is coloured steel roofs, which are mostly imported from Taiwan and China, with some also coming from Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and elsewhere.“Rates of importing coloured steel roofs in the year 2000 were small,” said Daw Mya Thida, who owns Kaung Kin Thit coloured steel roof shop. “But now construction material stores sell them more than anything else.”She said Chinese coloured steel roofs are cheaper, at K850 a square foot for a 0.36mm thickness, but Taiwanese materials, which go for K950, are better quality.“Taiwan-made roofing is coated with aluminum under the paint. It won’t rust if the paint peels off,” Daw Mya Thida said.Those on a budget, however, may look to Chinese materials, the thinnest of which goes for K450 a square feet.Since this price isn’t much different from the price of a thatched roof, many who formerly would have chosen thatch are now able to opt for steel instead. This provides more long-lasting protection, according to the owners of a construction materials business in Saw Bwar Gyi Gone sales centre.“Those coloured steel roofs have been popular for four or five years due to durability,” said Daw Nwe Nwe, sales manager of Shwe Sin Min coloured steel roof shop. “Plus [customers] can choose the colour which suits the building’s design and the surroundings.”Daw Nwe Nwe added that there is no difference in price according to colour. So what pairs well with the Myanmar landscape? Most go for colours that match the environment, she said: The most popular are reddish brown, sky blue and green.Orange, dark brown and light green roof are also available, but are proving much less popular with buyers.The drawbacks of a steel roof are that they’re hot in the sun and noisy in the rain – both of which Myanmar gets a lot. Both problems can be mitigated by installing insulators such as fibreglass, wool and foil under the roof. But you may also want to consider a few alternatives as well.Coloured zinc roofs are usually imported, but you can order the design you like in factories in the Shwepyithar and Hlaingtharyar industrial zones. The exotic-sounding choices include wave, concave wave, convex wave, universe, Taiwan design, eagle design and classic.Another option is concrete tiles. Popular among the moderately well-to-do, they’re mostly found in townships outside the big cities. The downside, U Aung Lin Tun said, is that concrete tiles can become stained with mould within five years, which will reduce the appeal of your property.The priciest option is clay tiles. Quiet in the rain, cool in the sun, fire-retardant, efficient at draining water and coated with enamel to discourage mould build-up, clay tiles are usually only affordable for the rich.Daw Win Min Thant, from Zin Htet cement and construction materials business, said clay tiles currently make up about 20 percent of the market. They’re usually found in resort bungalows, hotel projects, single houses and company offices into which owners can afford to pour a lot of money.“The cost of roofing with clay tiles is 20 times more than with zinc tiles,” said U Aung Lin Tun from EVA Company, which orders tiles from Thailand’s SCG Company.The investment can pay off in the long term, however. Salesperson U Myo Thant from Natural Clay Company said their tiles, made – as you’d guess – from natural clay use Japanese technology and can last up to 90 years.Of course, money’s not the only factor to consider. Another urgent issue when putting on a new roof is timing. Remember, whether thatch or zinc, steel or clay, there’s no time like the present to get your roof sorted.After all, no one likes finding out they should have put on a new roof last winter – especially not when the first sign of trouble is the drip-drip of monsoon rain in your living room.Translation by Win Thaw Tar","/special-features/174-building-for-the-future/8945-putting-a-roof-over-your-head.html"

Crumbling red-brick villas, with cavernous bay-windows eyeing the hungry jungle vines that do a better job holding the structure together than the decades-old mortar, give way to shiny new condo developments careening ever upward.Street barbeque stalls with well-worn and precariously cracked plastic stools are fading into smart cafes that serve pizza and burgers and boast hipster-chic lighting installations.As the international eye of investment turns to Myanmar, the influxes of expats here are finding a home in this area on and around Yangon’s Yaw Min Gyi Street.Nestled north of gridlocked downtown and behind the iconic Parkroyal Hotel, Yaw Min Gyi is blossoming with creature comforts for the expat renter.Al-fresco bakeries, Western cafes, boutique fashion retailers and even Yangon’s first “Fro-Yo” dot the pretty streets of the Yaw Min Gyi area, all of which offer a magnetic “feels like home” appeal that caters to the wave of new foreign faces.“Most changes started in 1990,” said Tony Lin, owner of the iconic Sun Cafe that has been on the street since 1947.“The cafe used to be in a house at the end of the street with a wedding reception and we moved into this new building because we thought it would attract more customers,” he said of the Sun Cafe’s current location inside one of the first condo apartment blocks built in the area.The 45-year-old businessman said he had watched in the last few years as his clientele morphed from local working men into a boisterous range of Western and Japanese expats.Auntie Boke, a real estate agent based in Yaw Min Gyi, has also seen her clientele change dramatically over the past decade.“This is a special community where my family has been living since 1966,” the entrepreneur real estate agent said inside her offices on Yaw Min Gyi, which was formerly known as York Road under British rule.At that time her family had a flat inside one of the colonial, two-storey apartment blocks that shouldered the then-languid downtown avenues.Without the modern conveniences of Wi-Fi or mobiles, the property market in each neighbourhood by default fell into the hands of the most knowledgeable family or individual in the thicket. For the jovial Auntie Boke this was a natural playground for a woman whose family also ran the neighbourhood’s phone shop.Changes have come in all shapes and sizes and all ends of the spectrum, from welcome to problematic.“I don’t ever want to leave this place,” the raven-haired, motherly figure said. “This [neighbourhood] has a great location, not far from downtown, good electricity and a good community feel – many neighbours are friends.”Auntie Boke’s adoptive business protégé, American David Ney, agreed that one of the aspects of Yaw Min Gyi is the enduring sense of community shared among the expats and locals that populate its modernising streets.In addition to western shops, one can also find spas, gyms and an international selection of dining options, all of which opened in recent years.“All the well laid-out cafes and shops in this area are relatively new,” Mr Ney said. “There’s been the addition of an international burger shop in six months, and there are two pizza places on this road.“There’s also a very large Japanese population here. Because of that there are Japanese-language-only restaurants. Apparently walking into a place like that is exactly like walking into a small Tokyo sake bar.”With the international influences comes the suffocation of traditional street stalls and vendors. Street stalls that were almost a permanent fixture on the streets are being swept away in favour of large construction and increased traffic.“It’s changing – I wish there was some way to compensate for both [old and new],” Mr Ney lamented.The first changes came when the wealthy Chinese Mandalay and Shan populations came to Yangon in the nineties, said Gallery 65 curator and owner U Min Lwin. The recent stream of Western and Japanese expats has brought a new wave of changes to the area, helping fuel demand for galleries like U Min Lwin’s, as well as open mike nights and other performance exhibitions held in stately residences in the area.Gallery 65 is the bottom half of one of the last colonial landed homes in the area. U Min Lwin’s parents still live on the upper floor of the swelling, dark teak residence.“It used to be [filled with] houses like this – with yards and where everyone knew each other,” U Min Lwin said.Three other stately homes in similar style to his parents’ were built on the road in the early 20th century, but two were razed during World War II while the third was developed into apartment blocks, U Min Lwin said.“The atmosphere has changed here.”","/business/property-news/8844-yaw-min-gyi-area-growing-in-line-with-foreign-tastes.html"
"331",331,"A trickle of foreigners  follow the road to Mandalay",2013-11-18,"In Depth","If the flow of Western expatriates filling Yangon’s bars, bakeries and beer stations can be described as a flood, then Mandalay is seeing just a trickle of the same.          Long a magnet for Chinese businesspeople, the city is home to just a few dozen Western expatriates – barely a fraction of the thousands of Western teachers, businesspeople and NGO workers clustered in Myanmar’s largest city.Mandalay’s Western community has a decidedly different flavour than Yangon’s. And since the advent of direct flights to Mandalay, many expats here say they have never bothered to visit Yangon.The small expatriate community is spread throughout the city, with foreigners often living near the schools at which they teach. They keep in touch through a Facebook group, on which events and meetings at several Western-style bars that have sprung up in the last year are posted.Natashia Curtis, a Canadian teacher who arrived in Mandalay in early 2012, said the city is a comfortable place to live despite lacking some modern conveniences and having few entertainment options.With few foreigners in town, the community tends to be quite close-knit, she said. “It’s an easy place to live in, even though it’s a bit off the beaten track, a bit rustic,” she said.“It’s easy to fall into life here.”Ms Curtis and fellow teacher Vila Thach are the administrators of the “In the MandaLoop” Facebook page, which simplifies organising meet-ups and assists expats with answering questions and making local connections.The group started with barely a dozen members last year as a way to keep in touch, as many foreigners taught at different schools and communication was difficult without mobile phones.MandaLoop has since grown to 70 members, though far below similar expat groups such as the 1130 members for Yangon Connection Facebook group, and 2549 for the Yangon Expat Connection Google group.It was difficult coordinating expat meet-ups before the Facebook group started and several recent expatriate-oriented restaurants opened their doors, Ms Curtis said. Until recently it had been “entirely possible” to live in Mandalay as an expat without meeting any other foreigners, particularly if not working at a school, she said. While the use of motorbikes means expats in Mandalay are relatively mobile, this also leads to them being spread throughout the city.Lieutenant Colonel Thaung Zaw, director of Mandalay Region’s immigration and registration department, said the majority of Western expats in the city are employed as teachers.Some 500 foreigners on business visas are registered with the city’s immigration department and allowed to work locally. Most are Chinese citizens.As of last month, 25 Americans were registered, along with eight from the United Kingdom, and a handful of Australians, Europeans and Canadians, Lt Col Thaung Zaw said.“The number is now growing as a result of the government’s reform strategy. More foreigners want to come to invest or work in a business,” he said.Mr Thach said that about six Mandalay schools presently hire Westerners as teachers, though many are located far from the traditional tourist haunts. This has meant expatriate life was just as likely to take place in the restaurants and beer stations of 35th Street as the tourist enclaves near the palace and the Indian quarter.However, this is beginning to change, particularly as several Western-style establishments have opened their doors in recent months and become havens for thirsty foreigners.Thomas Linton, manager at Hunter’s Cafe and Bar on 27th Street, said his establishment initially aimed to cater to the expat and tourist markets.“I don’t want to deter people from having a Myanmar experience. Go and sit in the tea shops and the beer stations. But I’m here for when you need a break and [to] have your beef burger and glass of red wine,” he said.Mr Linton has been living on and off in Myanmar since 1997 and the laid-back Mandalay lifestyle clearly appeals to him.“I had a high-stress job and lifestyle in Darwin [Australia], earning a lot more money. But here you can chill out a little more, don’t have to worry about things so much,” he said. “Expats in Mandalay realise [they’re living in] one of the final frontiers.”While Mr Linton initially figured business would come primarily from Westerners, he said he has been surprised the majority of his customers are Myanmar eager for a Western experience.At Central Park restaurant, further down 27th Street, Wilbur Hong, a Myanmar national who has spent much of his life abroad, said he had not expected to draw so many expat customers when he opened his restaurant earlier this year.However, a menu heavy on Western fare, a network of expat friends and listing on TripAdvisor all drive foreign business to his restaurant, he said. He estimates about 20 to 30 percent of his customers are foreigners, and almost two-thirds of these are Mandalay-based teachers.Although attracted to the city’s slow pace and lack of traffic jams, Mr Hong conceded that Mandalay might not suit everyone.“If expats are looking for a city lifestyle, than Mandalay might not be the right place for them. But if the expat is looking to enjoy local Burmese culture, Mandalay is the priority place,” he said.The immigration department’s Lt Col Thaung Zaw said the city is keen to receive economic benefits from abroad, with the number of Western businesspeople slowly increasing.“Westerners [who live in Mandalay] spend so much money,” he said.The major headache for the department has come from foreigners who do not abide by visa regulations. A common example is attempting to work on a tourist visa. Unintentionally breaking this rule results in a polite request to cease working but a deliberate violation can result in deportation and the individual being placed on a blacklist and refused entry to Myanmar, he said.Lt Col Thaung Zaw said that foreigners are sometimes heavy drinkers and misunderstandings do occasionally arise between Westerners and locals but the expat community generally receives a warm welcome from Mandalay residents. The city has introduced “Foreigner Care Teams” at the township and ward levels to assist in addressing issues.While Lt Col Thaung Zaw said he believed the growth in expats the city has seen in recent years is likely to continue, there are questions over whether this is positive for Mandalay.Some say that the city stands to benefit from the influx of expatriates, and the expertise and investment dollars they bring, while others say Mandalay could risk losing a bit of what makes it special.“If everywhere looked the same, if Mandalay and Yangon looked the same, it’d be like everyone wearing the same t-shirt on a street,” said Mr Hong. “How would you feel?”","/in-depth/8802-a-trickle-of-foreigners-follow-the-road-to-mandalay.html"
"332",332,"Basic yet poignant: Local artists featured at Singapore Biennale",2013-11-03,"Lifestyle","Responding to the theme, ‘If the World Changed’, two Myanmar installation artists were commissioned to feature their work at the Singapore Biennale 2013           If the World Changed is this year’s Singapore Biennale theme, asking artists living and working in Southeast Asia how they see the world around them.The approach is particularly suited to the region, considering the pluralities of language, cultures, artistic traditions, and some of the fastest socioeconomic growth witnessed in this region.Though incredibly diverse and unique, as a region, the countries of Southeast Asia share identities: Traumatic periods of political struggle, coveted natural resources and an increasing appetite for commercial consumerism.Some artists chose to address where they or their respective cultures and countries have been, some looked into the future to what will be and still, others recognised that for many people living in the region, the world had not changed very much at all.But no country has experienced change quite like Myanmar has in the past two years.In a rare opportunity for Myanmar artists, their work was commissioned by the Singapore Biennale, specifically for the event. In two separate installations, Nge Lay and Po Po addressed two topics close to the hearts of people in Myanmar – education and spirituality.Myanmar curator, Aye Ko said, “Nge Lay’s work reflects on Myanmar’s poor education system and Po Po is a senior artist with a very strong body of work.”The start of Nge Lay’s project began years ago as part of her interest in the Myanmar children’s education system. Her work investigates whether the rules of government curricula – instilled decades ago into the public education system – encouraged children to think critically or creatively.Her project for the biennale was conceived as part of her work with the Thuye’dan Village art project, a collaboration between 10-12 artists who travel every year to the home village of the internationally exhibited artist and husband of Nge Lay, Aung Ko.Two hours outside of Pyay on the banks of the Ayeyarwaddy River, the village hosts a local monastery, fisherman, cattle and crops. Environmental damage and heavy foreign investment in the area is affecting villagers and their livelihoods.Nge Lay invited visitors and artists to a grade one classroom at the village primary school. There, she swapped brand new school supplies and backpacks with the children in exchange for their own, worn out materials, lesson books, and traditional bags. She photographed the teacher and the classroom; even the teak walls had chalk lessons drawn on. This eventually became her installation at the Singapore Biennale, Sick Classroom. Each of the 26 students from Thuye’dan Village were fashioned in wood, (built together with a village craftsman) uniquely positioned by wearing the classic Myanmar school uniform – white on top, green on the bottom. The teacher was also a wooden statue at the front of the classroom, referring to her notes on the blackboard.The classroom represents a critique on early childhood education in Myanmar and the unknown paths that a child will take to achieve – or fail – to live up to a basic knowledge level subscribed by the government.What is more, local village schools often have no infrastructure for education – state funding does not apply therefore the teachers and students are subjected to a program which has not been updated in decades. Often, the local monasteries must take responsibility to doubly support reading, writing, and recitation.It’s no secret how important Buddhism is to the majority of Myanmar citizens, both as religion and philosophy. Artist Po Po draws on his devotion to Buddhism to help convey the power of meditation to his audience.Fort Canning Park is as close to nature as one can get in central Singapore. The winding paths bring a wanderer through banyans, palms, and landmarks. Perhaps this is why Po Po chose a small, isolated section of this park for his installation, Road to Nirvana.Painted fluorescent green strings are tightly pulled into a twisted half vortex, held by an environmentally friendly metal contraption which hugs the tree, saving any nails from being born into its trunk. These string “sculptures” lead the viewer to walk the path off the paved road of the park. Embarking on this short journey brings focus, calm, and a few mosquitoes.Institutions often refer to Po Po as a conceptual artist, because of his unorthodox manipulation of everyday materials and choice of location when it comes to the display of an artwork. The works’ effect, like the Road to Nirvana, comes only after introspection from the participant and physical experience. An intimate gathering in Fort Canning Park on the opening night of the exhibition marked the soft launch for his work. Po Po asked an attendee to read out loud a poem by Robert Frost, titled “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” whose famous last lines, “but I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,” a parallel to Po Po’s path to an enlightened state of being.Artists from all over Southeast Asia exhibiting at the biennale addressed personal histories or regional issues but the artists from Myanmar kept their work intimate and experiential, inviting viewers in who more than likely knew probably very little about the country, its people and its recent transition woes into a democracy. More familiar in Singapore might be a few of the following themes addressed in artworks from the region: the shared history of Singapore and Malaysia, the massacre of the Chinese in Indonesia, the disappearing environments due to heavy industry and the growing consumerism of a globalised economy.Nge Lay and Po Po kept it basic, perhaps based on the assumption that regardless of their intentions, viewers would interpret the artwork based on their understanding of the theme, If the World Changed. In the context of Myanmar, this would likely evoke the country’s transition from isolated pariah state to a member of global community.Instead of focusing on the artists’ reference to their home country, the real challenge lies in a self-reflexive questioning of educational systems and current journeys. If the world changed for the better or worse, who would be responsible?The Singapore Biennale 2013 runs until February 2014.","/lifestyle/8661-basic-yet-poignant-local-artists-featured-at-singapore-biennale.html"
"333",333,"Tourism sector sees influx of travellers and cash",2013-10-28,"Travel 'n' Tour Myanmar","Despite a few teething issues involving money transfers and visa systems, the hotels and tourism sector in Myanmar is seeing an unprecedented boom in investment.          Myanmar has 859 hotels, motels and guest houses, with a total of 30,000 available rooms. That number is soon to increase, with hotel zone projects underway at Ngapali Beach in Rakhine State, Inle Lake in Shan State and in the area around Mandalay, including Bagan.Major international hotel players such as Accor of France, Hilton of the United States and Vietnam’s HAGL Group are looking to open new hotels in Myanmar.Figures from the Union of Myanmar Chambers of Commerce and Industry show foreign direct investment increased from last year’s US$1064 million to $1585 million this year, making the industry the fifth-largest sector by FDI.During a visit to Yangon by a Vietnamese delegation in mid-October, Minister of Public Security General Tran Dai Quang announced entrepreneurs from Vietnam alone have invested $300 million in Myanmar’s tourist industry.To September, more than 1 million people visited Myanmar in 2013, according to Vice President U Sai Mauk Kham, an increase of more than 58 percent over the same eight-month period last year. “We expect more than 2 million will come this year,” the vice president said during his address at a ceremony in Nay Pyi Taw commemorating World Tourism Day.The majority of visitors in 2013 so far are those from neighbouring countries on business or to meet government officials. The number of those here for tourism purposes has increased slightly over the previous year’s figures.The passenger lists to last September show 67,000 visitors from Thailand, 43,000 from Japan, 20,000 from France and 18,000 from the United Kingdom. Chinese travellers constitute the biggest portion. Myanmar expects the number of visitors will more than double in the next two years.But this figure tells but half the story of the country’s tourism industry. Workers in tourismrelated jobs – hotel staff, travel service providers, transporters, restaurant workers, local handicraft makers – also need to be operating swiftly and smoothly. The habits – cultural and financial – of visitors also make a difference in terms of how profitable a visit will be. “For me personally, I don’t expect 1000 travellers from China,” said one member of the Myanmar Tourism Entrepreneurs Association.“Instead, I will look for only 100 from Western countries. It is more valuable for the tourism industry.” U Htun Myat, of the Myanmar Tour Guide Association, said guests from Western countries accept that they need pay prescribed taxes and the prescribed rates for tour guides and need to stay at hotels that are officially registered.They also understand the socioenvironmental issues, U Htun Myat said. The country’s Tourism Master Plan was drawn up with the assistance of the Norwegian government and the Asia Development Bank.It was made public last June at the World Economic Forum in Nay Pyi Taw. The plan allots $500 million for development of infrastructure and training of the staff who provide services in the tourism sector.It also seeks to increase the number of annual visitors to 7 million by 2020 and to increase revenueto $10 billion. “We will see both the good and bad sides of the developments,” said Union Minister for Tourism U Htay Aung at the World Economic Forum.“We will be doing our best in managing the industry’s development.” The immigration department has opened the border checkpoints for international travellers to promote tourism. More than 495,000 visitors came in through international airports and more than 535,000 came through border checkpoints from January to September this year.The government has signed agreements to institute a Smart Visa program along with Indonesia, the Phillippines and Cambodia, to ease travel between those nations. It also plans to extend its visas-on-arrival scheme on October 26. With Myanmar hosting the SEA Games in December and taking over as chair of ASEAN, no doubt these changes are only the beginning.","/special-features/172-travel-n-tour-myanmar/8621-tourism-sector-sees-influx-of-travellers-and-cash.html"
"334",334,"Mining Law to get an overhaul, officials say",2013-10-13,"Business","The 1994 Mining Law is set for a sweeping overhaul that could see nearly 70 percent of the existing law amended, an official said last week.          U Nay Win Tun, an Amyotha Hluttaw representative and chairman of the Mining and Resources Affairs Committee, said the changes would see the new bill reworked to meet international standards while giving more Myanmar companies the opportunity to work in thesector.“The new mining bill has two significant changes. First, it was drafted under international criteria and second, it will level the playing field among Myanmar investors in the mining sector,” he said. A draft of the new law has not yet been made public. The Gemstone Law, which pertains to precious stones, is also being amended.The committee submitted its proposed amendments to the Amyotha Hluttaw on October 1. The Mining Law amendments will be debated by MPs within two weeks, U Nay Win Tun, who also serves as the chairman of Ruby Dragon Mining, said. However, it could take months for a final version to emerge from parliament, because the amendments will also have to be approved by the Pyithu Hluttaw, or lower house.The existing law, and the delay in amending it, have significantly dampened early excitement that Myanmar’s economic opening would mean a quick score for international mining companies looking to capitalise on the country’s abundant mineral resources that remain relatively unexplored.Last year mining conferences in Yangon drew hundreds of international company representatives eying Myanmar’s rich deposits of gold, zinc, copper, nickel and tin, but most walked away disappointed by the restrictive legal framework and the lack of preparation and capacity by the Ministry of Mines.Instead of staking their claim in Myanmar, most have decided to take a wait-and-see approach, pursuing projects elsewhere while they keep an eye on Nay Pyi Taw to see what the new law will look like when it is signed before moving forward.According to Alisher Ali, chairman of the Yangon-based investment banking advisory firm Mandalay Capital, the inadequate law is the biggest reason that there has been “lacklustre foreign direct investment in the mining sector”.Mr Ali added that proper changes to the law would make “the environment more conducive to foreign companies”, and that Myanmar was a country of “significant potential”, with the right framework in place.“The oil and gas sector is testimony to how the country has been a magnet for FDI, and mining can do the same. There is the same level of interest if the legislation is correct,” he said.One of the biggest stumbling blocks for potential foreign miners is Myanmar’s production sharing contract (PSC) between the private party and the Ministry of Mines.Under the current Mines Law, the Ministry of Mines acts a non-equity partner but is still entitled to around 30pc of minerals extracted, plus the relevant income tax and royalties owed.Yet another area of concern for foreign investors is the rule banning exports of ore, coal and gold, a protectionist measure meant to ensure that processing is done in-country.There are also issues surrounding the ability of companies to move from one phase of an operation to the next, like from exploration to site development, without newcontracts.“In the current system these are separate contracts, so the mining companies have a concern that they might spend a lot of money in exploration without being legally certain they can take the next step,” said Edwin Van der Bruggen, a partner at the law firm VDB Loi in Yangon.Perhaps the most contentious issue for both local and domestic mining operations is land ownership and resettlement.“In the current system, the mining company has to agree on compensation with the occupiers of land, but there is no guidance on how much that compensation should be,” Mr Vanderbruggen said.These problems have been highlighted by the ongoing dispute at the Letpadaung copper mine in central Myanmar.The mine, the country’s largest, is a joint venture between the Chinese backed Wanbao Mining and the military-controlled Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited. It has been the site of tensions as local residents continue to protest government land confiscations.“This is a really difficult issue to address so I would not be surprised if the new law remains silent on this point,” he said.","/business/8442-mining-law-to-get-an-overhaul-officials-say.html"
"335",335,"Removing the barriers on the road to business growth - Analysis",2013-09-29,"Business","For the nearly four years I had served as US Ambassador to and board member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Myanmar was a bit of a black hole. Little information emerged from the country and what economic data that came out was suspect at best. The road to socialism seemed a road to ruin when it came to economic growth figures.          During my time in the post, there would be no new ADB or World Bank lending to Myanmar given its more than a billion dollars of past loans in arrears. US and European sanctions also meant that even small amounts of technical assistance would be opposed by me and representatives of several other Western countries on the ADB board.With the recent lifting or suspension of sanctions and Japan’s writing off or providing bridge loans to cover hundreds of millions of dollars of Myanmar’s debt, the development bankers and aid agencies are back with a vengeance. US President Barack Obama included Myanmar on his first overseas visit since winning re-election last November. No longer restricted by US policy, I too have now travelled throughout the country, focusing first on visiting sites and sights once cut off to sanctions-observing western visitors, from Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon to the traditional fishermen of Inle Lake.I also have sought to begin to build a better understanding of Myanmar’s most pressing challenges and to think through how the success and failures of development projects in other nations may offer lessons. This will be critical as donor nations and partners begin to map out hundreds of millions of dollars of new assistance to Myanmar – a nation that in the near term may well have limited capacity to absorb such help.From hydroelectric investments advanced by Chinese state-owned enterprises to educational reform programs supported by European and Australian aid agencies, efforts to assist Myanmar will be driven by varying motives, whether humanitarian, geopolitical or commercial. They likely will also be of varying quality and more often than not may be extremely costly to taxpayers back home. With that in mind, it is worth pausing to ask some questions and garner insight from the experiences of other nations that emerged from decades of isolation. One example is Vietnam.Having resumed operations in 1993 in Vietnam, the ADB has provided more than US$12 billion in loans and assistance for fighting poverty and building Vietnamese infrastructure, after that nation, like Myanmar today, began to reform and open. Billions more have followed. But has such assistance, whether from the ADB, the World Bank or USAID, been successful?That is a critical question to ponder as Myanmar’s political leaders – in power and in opposition – ideally come together to move the nation forward even before elections scheduled for 2015. For present and future leaders, it will be important that they too gain a better understanding of the strengths and shortcomings of development assistance, whether for agricultural, transport, energy or financial sector projects. Ultimately, it will be a strong rule of law and the private sector that will drive job creation and economic growth.During my time at the ADB, I saw firsthand how lives were improved across the region, whether by donor-assisted increased access to water and roads in Sri Lanka or through support for rural electrification efforts in Bhutan. But I also saw how ambitious projects, such as privatisation efforts and outsourcing in the power sector in Pakistan, failed in implementation. Less-than-successful projects underscored the need for better planning, due diligence, and continued and greater oversight at development partners and within the nations they seek to help. This will also be the case in Myanmar as development partners rush in, often with limited coordination.Indeed, over the last two decades the record of success in ADB projects, according to its own evaluations, has been mixed. In some countries, such as Pakistan, success rates have dropped significantly in a range of sectors.Take again Vietnam as an example. While 82 percent of ADB projects that had been evaluated as of December 31, 2012, have been rated “successful”, according to the 2013 ADB country fact sheet on Vietnam, only 66.7pc of  projects involving water supply and municipal infrastructure and services, and 69.2pc of agricultural and natural resources projects were deemed successful. Other sectors saw much better success rates, including education and finance. Though comparing Vietnam in the 1993 and Myanmar in 2013 is a bit like comparing apples and oranges, the question remains whehter the next two decades of development for Myanmar will benefit from lessons learned from the past two decades of official development assistance to Vietnam.With elections ahead, and political and economic reforms far from locked in, it will be up to Myanmar’s people and the nation’s leaders to shape their own future.  There also remain a few persistent questions that I would encourage the nation’s development partners, as well as Myanmar’s business, government and civil society leaders to take to heart, regardless of political affiliation.Is Myanmar’s government bureaucracy fostering or instead hindering economic growth? The track record of the government’s performance is mixed everywhere. Whether in Bangkok or Washington, DC, a real fight against bureaucracy must be less about new organisation charts and more about assessing what works and what does not, and then getting rid of the latter. It’s the service quality and not just the size of the bureaucracy that matters. Government jobs should be viewed as neither spoils for victorious parties nor a source of lifetime benefits for those who hold those positions.How are regulations impacting job creation? With large numbers of people employed, or underemployed, in agriculture and expectations growing for higher-paid jobs, this remains one of the most critical questions for countries everywhere. Some level of regulation is essential. Yet, whether in the power industry or agriulture, rules must be consistent and enforced fairly if citizens and outside investors are to have the confidence to create jobs essential for Myanmar’s future.When is government intervention appropriate? Governments in Asia have rightly been criticised for seeking to pick winners and losers, often distorting markets and hurting competition. Myanmar’s large neighbors, China and India, provide numerous examples of intervention gone awry. Too often, however, government interventions and inefficiency can go hand in hand. Policymakers need to ensure such interventions are limited and are there as a last resort.What more can be done to root out corruption? Throughout the world corruption and cronyism go hand-in-hand. The United States is not immune, ranking only 19th “least corrupt” on Transparency International’s 2012 Corruption Perception Index, which looks at perceived levels of public sector corruption, with the lower the number the better the ranking. Myanmar continues to rank near the bottom out of more than 175 rated countries and territories, alongside Somalia and North Korea, though data sources are limited. China ranks 80th worst and India 94th when it comes to perceived levels of public corruption.Allegations of favouritism or leniency must be investigated, institutions strengthened and individuals held accountable if people are to have any confidence in the public sector.At the heart of these four simple questions is my view that policymakers and development partners everywhere must commit to tear down new “bric” walls being built of bureaucracy, regulation, interventionism and corruption. The prescription for economic growth in the world’s developed and developing nations is straightforward: improve the bureaucracy, regulate fairly, intervene rarely and stamp out corruption. Increased sectarianism too must also be addressed. Investment, capital and business confidence and growth will follow. This is also true for Myanmar.What the nation – and indeed all of South and Southeast Asia, and perhaps even the United States – needs now is to overcome division and discord, and to focus on innovation, infrastructure improvements and a policy environment that will foster the job growth necessary to drive the economy forward. Without question, all the people of Myanmar, regardless of ethnicity or religion, deserve no less than this.Curtis S.Chin served as US ambassador to the Asian Development Bank from 2007 to 2010.

""I cannot guarantee that there will not be backslides,"" Suu Kyi said at Singapore Management University on Sunday. There is a ""need to change the constitution, which provides the military with a privileged space in national politics,"" she said, describing it as the first step toward ensuring the military does not interfere with a civilian government.Myanmar's shift to democracy after five decades of military rule has drawn interest from companies including Google, Coca-Cola and Unilever, while MasterCard last September became the first payments network to issue a license to a bank in the country. Chinese and Japanese companies are also investing in the nation, which borders India, China and Thailand.Still, the country needs to improve its rule of law and democratic reforms must not wait for 2015, when general elections are scheduled to be held, Suu Kyi said on Saturday during her visit to Singapore. She said in June that she wants to run for president, even as she is ineligible to become head of state under the current constitution.""If you are going to try to revive the economy, you need capital,"" Suu Kyi said Saturday, when asked if investors should wait for more political stability before committing resources to the country. ""I wouldn't advise you to draw out. I would like you to continue your investments. But make them as responsible as possible.""Myanmar must question whether its transition to democracy is stable and strong enough, Suu Kyi said Sunday. She cannot run for president because the constitution says the president can't have a child who is the citizen of a foreign country, and her two sons are British nationals.The country's parliament has said it plans to review the 2008 military-drafted constitution, with a commission to recommend changes. Suu Kyi has strengthened ties with the military since joining parliament, while President Thein Sein's shift toward democracy has prompted countries such as the U.S. to ease sanctions.Suu Kyi on Sunday asked young people in the country to contribute more to society. She also said she does not blame citizens who want to detach themselves from Myanmar and make a life for themselves abroad.""I want the young people to help in transition,"" she said in a separate speech organized by the Myanmar Club in Singapore. ""Don't wait for the situation inside the country to improve,"" she told hundreds of nationals who gave her a standing ovation when she appeared on stage.It is the government's responsibility to diminish the fear of attack by ethnic groups through the enforcement of just laws, Suu Kyi said Sunday. Sectarian violence erupted last June between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine state, and many of Myanmar's 64 million people view the 800,000 Rohingya as illegal migrants from what is now Bangladesh.    The government must also protect its people and the country from ""rapacious"" multinationals or individuals through rule of law, transparency and accountability, she said. The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry said in a statement it held a meeting with Suu Kyi about the business and investment environment in Myanmar.    The country needs clean courts, more efficient law enforcement and an independent judiciary, which is ""one of the first requirements for the rule of law,"" Suu Kyi separately saidon Saturday. A firmer rule of law will include changes to the constitution, she said, without giving details.    The investment scene in the Southeast Asian nation ""is not as bright as people had hoped it would be"" and investors ""are not sure that their investment will be safe and secure because there isn't a rule of law,"" Suu Kyi said.","/national-news/8256-no-guarantees-suu-kyi-urges-caution-on-myanmar-investments.html"
"337",337,"Chin urge transparency on Mwe Taung mining project",2013-09-20,"National News","Chin political parties and residents are calling for transparency over a Chinese-backed project, with some warning that the project could lead to a repeat of the unrest seen at the Letpadaung copper mine.          Geological studies of the Mwe Taung Phar Taung area – on the border of Chin State’s Tiddim township and Sagaing Region’s Kale township – show three deposits of mixed nickel and iron capable of providing nearly 17,000 tonnes of pure nickel annually.A survey carried out by Chin political parties, civil societies and MPsfrom September 2 to 9, however, shows that many residents in the area are concerned about the potential impact on their businesses and the environment.“There are at least 14 villages that rely on the mountain,” said U Zo Zam, chairman of the Chin National Party and a Chin State Hluttaw representative for Tiddim, said at a press conference in Yangon on September 16. “Locals are concerned for their livelihoods because they don’t know the details about the project. It’s necessary to implement the project transparently.”The Chin political parties have issued a joint statement listing seven demands concerning the project, including enacting a law on profit allocation from natural resources, improved environmental protections and more dialogue with locals, since many don’t know exactly what’s happening with the project.“We are concerned our present situation will be destroyed by the project,” said U Thang Pi, who lives in Tiddim township.According to the survey, one point of concern is that both companies linked to the project are Chinese. Financial backing – nearly US$500 million – is said to be coming from North Mining Investment, while Kenbo – active in Myanmar’s mining sector under the military government – is implementing the project. The poll showed residents feel development in the area should only involve companies from democratic countries. They perceive that Chinese companies only focus on their own interests and neglect those of residents, the poll found.Neither company is connected to the controversial China-backed copper mine at Monywa in Sagaing Region, which has been the subject of at times violent protests, but residents say they are concerned that they will face similar land confiscations and evictions at Mwe Taung Phar Taung. They warned that this could lead to potential unrest.“We are now worried because we heard that the project is financed by the same company that has invested in the Letpadaung project,” said U Lian Thwung from the Chin Mountain Resources Watch Group. “Villagers [at Letpadaung] are in trouble because of them. There are a lot of land disputes there. There can be no faith in Chinese companies whatsoever.”At a meeting on September 7 between four Chin political parties and the Chin State government, state officials said those wanting to know more about the Mwe Taung Phar Taung project would need to get the details from the central government, U Zo Zam said.“The state government said there is no agreement between the Union government and North Mining Investment company for the project. We will contact the relevant governments, companies and embassies to inform them of the facts we have now. Then we will try to discuss [the project] in a meeting with union officials. We will also ask some advice from international groups,” U Zo Zam said.However, state-run newspaper Myanmar Ahlin reported on March 30 that North Mining Investment had taken over the project because another Chinese company, Kan Bau, had been given permission but failed to implement the project. The paper also said that the Chin State government would get US$500,000, or 2 percent of the profits, each year if the project is successful.Chin National Party general secretary Salai Ceu Bilc Thang said if the project goes ahead the state should get significantly more profit.“The Union government should get at least 51pc of the profit,” he said. “And the Chin State government should get at least 20pc.”Neither of the investors could be reached for comment and the Chinese embassy in Yangon did not respond to a request for comment. – Translated by Thiri Min Htun","/national-news/8207-chin-urge-transparency-on-mwe-taung-mining-project.html"

We’re waiting for peace to be achieved in that area,” he said. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) is in conflict with the Tatmadaw in much of the northern state.The company also wants to ensure there is a stronger legal system in place governing foreign investments before proceeding.“The foreign investment law has just been issued, and we’re waiting for [more] detailed regulation to come to the public,” he said.U Maw Thar Htwe, director general of the Department of Hydropower Implementation, claimed the company had halted work primarily due to a flare-up in the fighting last year.“The company had been building bridges, roads and other infrastructure to develop the projects. But work has stopped because of security problems,” he said.Mr Li added further regulations including regulation on investment, environment, and energy projects will assist UACBH with ensuring it can proceed with its investments without facing stoppages.Permission to restart Myitsone, which is slated to eventually cost $8 billion, may be some time away, he said, adding that once the benefits were explained it would be easier to convince the public it is in Myanmar’s interest to proceed.He claimed the electricity generated from the hydro dam will be earmarked for either the Chinese or the Myanmar market depending on domestic demand.The firm has taken over compensation efforts for the relocated villagers from the government, aiming to fairly compensate villagers, he said.“Otherwise these people want to return to their former sites. This is also not good for the whole Mysitone project,” he said.Although Myitsone is the only hydro dam where development had begun, Mr Li said, of the six others, the Laza project on the Malikha River is the next likely candidate after Myitsone – not for reasons of its viability, but because it is easier to reach.“We were almost finished the feasibility study there,” he said. “The good road makes it convenient to reach Laza. It’s difficult to reach the other sites, so the feasibility study has not proceeded so smoothly.”He pointed to the Kaunglanhpu site as having the largest potential, due to the possibility for creating a large reservoir to draw from. This reservoir could also be drawn from to increase generation at the downstream projects in the dry season, increasing the viability for them all, he said.However, the road is currently limited that far north, he said, meaning it is some time before Kaunglanphu can be begun.U Maw Thar Htwe said that a smaller-scale Chipwinge hydropower project capable of generating 99 megawatts was also near completion in Kachin state, but had been halted last year due to conflict between the KIA and the Tatmadaw.","/business/8074-ayeyarwady-hydro-dams-in-limbo.html"

"340",340,"Lighting up the night, one customer at a time",2013-08-26,"Energy","Thanks to affordable and reliable solar technology, it’s getting easier to keep the lights on, even in some of the remotest corners of Myanmar           Eighty-four percent of rural households are still off the grid in this country, according to the World Economic Forum’s “New Energy Architecture: Myanmar” report. While rural dwellers have traditionally used candles and kerosene lamps fuelled with diesel in their homes after dark, economic development over the past few years has put a light at the end of the tunnel for some rural households struggling with the costs of non-renewable energy. With new technology finding its way to some of the furthest reaches of the country, the results are as different as, well, night and day.One company, Proximity Designs, has found an especially effective solution for those living without electricity: solar power. Based in Yangon, the company describes itself as a “social enterprise”, employing hundreds of people across the country and selling products and services specifically aimed at improving the lives of its customers. While many companies might make similar claims, Proximity Designs isn’t shilling luxury goods: It figures out what poor people, particularly in rural areas, need, then sets out to import – or, if they can’t find anything adequate, design and build themselves – high-quality products at prices customers can afford. With a wide range of products and services, Proximity offers anything from technology to advice to low-interest loans.One of its most successful units, which has become profitable on its own terms, is lighting. According to Chris Page, a business analyst for Proximity, the company has sold 22,000 solar-powered lights in rural Myanmar since it began offering them in March 2012.Proximity’s lights are made by d.light, a US-based company specialising in solar solutions in the developing world. The US-designed, China-manufactured solar lights sell for between US$9.50 and $33, depending on the model. That’s a higher cost than some of the other, cheaper brands currently on the market, but Mr Page said d.light’s products come with a difference.“These lights are quite durable,” he said. “We have these three tests: We can step on them, run them over with a motorbike, dump them in water – they’re water resistant. We can drop them out of a coconut tree. Quality is a huge thing here.”The value of such a reliable product light is obvious to rural dwellers, as it often helps with their work. For instance, rubber tappers in Mon State prefer to work at around 2am, while many rice threshers like to work in the middle of the night, he said.While solar-powered lighting seems a novel solution to Myanmar’s energy problem, its success means Proximity is not the only game in town. Over the past two years a number of primarily Chinese competitors have entered the business, often offering solar-powered lights at a discounted price. As a result, Mr Page said, Proximity helps customers look at better lighting as an investment in a brighter future.According to the company’s research, rural households spend an average of $4 to $6 a month paying for fuel for lamps or candles or other options such as flashlight batteries or diesel for generators. While d.lights may have a higher cost up-front, they pay off over the long term. And to alleviate the challenges of cobbling together the lump sum required for the lights, Proximity offers a credit program, allowing households to pay by installments. This is a major selling feature, according to Mr Page, as its rivals do not offer such plans.“People are so starved for cash they don’t want to spend more money then they have to on a product,” Mr Page said. “We have to make a case that it’s going to provide an economic benefit to them rather [than saying] this is really a quality light with a cool design or something.”Another factor differentiating a d.light from a competitor’s model is that d.lights rarely require servicing, while Chinese-made knock-offs often fall apart in a couple of months.One competitor recently copied a d.light model directly and sold the resulting product in Myanmar. Proximity sold the original at K29,000, while the counterfeit equivalent could be bought for K18,000. After two months of use, however, the counterfeit light generally broke down.“We had to register our copyright here,” Mr Page said. “In China, d.light took action against this [counterfeit] manufacturer.”Proximity expects its success with d.light’s products to draw further competition. Mr Page pointed to international firms such as Unilever and DKSH as enterprises with well-performing nationwide distribution systems, and said it was companies such as these that would capitalise on Myanmar opening up. But he also said Proximity’s hard-won reputation and extensive distribution network are key advantages.For instance, Proximity’s partners in border areas enable it to widen its distribution network beyond where it would be viable on its own. It has sold over 1000 lights in Chin State, and pursued a successful partnership with a Karen faith-based organisation.“Having the intimate knowledge of rural areas really gives us an edge over [competing] companies,” he said. “Right now in the solar light world, technology’s going to get more and more similar, and so it’s going to be about who can get into communities the best.”One of the next steps for Proximity is to offer solar panels capable of powering an EVD (enhanced versatile disc) player, which Mr Page said are in large demand in rural areas. Such solar panels are likely a year away from introduction to Myanmar, he said, but the plan is in keeping with the firm’s goal of providing in-demand products to people who otherwise have limited options.“In the 1990s, rural people, even if they needed to buy stuff, just couldn’t get access to good stuff,” he added. “That’s what Proximity really wants to do – provide distribution channels so people in rural markets can get really good products.”","/special-features/170-energy/7969-lighting-up-the-night-one-customer-at-a-time.html"
"341",341,"Who's who in offshore efforts ",2013-08-26,"Energy","Petronas / Yetagun           The Yetagun natural gas field has changed hands more than once since the first appraisal well was installed in 1992.Currently owned by Malaysian state energy firm Petronas, the project was initiated by Texaco Co of the United States. Development started in 1996, but the following year Texaco sold its entire stake to the United Kingdom’s Premier, which in turn sold its share of the project to Petronas in 2002.A subsidiary of the Malaysian firm is the current operator of the Yetagun natural gas field, operating in a partnership with PTTEP, Nippon Oil Exploration, and Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise, according to PTTEP’s website. Production began at the site in 2000, and the addition of four new wells in 2004 was thought to double Yetagun’s capacity. The site produced an average of 376 million cubic feet per day during the second quarter of 2013, PTTEP has reported.Located in the Gulf of Martaban, the concessions comprise blocks M12, M13, and M14 and cover 24,130 square kilometres.Total / YadanaAlthough international oil and gas firms have drawn criticism regarding industry practices, French firm Total’s activities in Myanmar have been singled out as worth emulating. Called “a responsible investor” by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi during a trip to Europe last year, in which she highlighted the need for “democracy-friendly investment” by companies such as Total. The firm began commercial production of the offshore Yadana Gas Field in 2000 following an investment outlay of about US$1 billion. With Total serving as operator in a consortium including Chevron, PTT Exploration and Production of Thailand, and Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise, the field has averaged 18.54 million cubic metres (654.7 million cubic feet) per day from 2001 to 2010, according to its website. With some 30 years of estimated reserves, gas from Yadana fuels Thai power plants as well as the domestic market.Company officials have also mulled further activities in the country, and Total is one of the 61 firms currently shortlisted for Myanmar’s 2013 offshore oil and gas tender.Pipeline firmsThe pipeline project involves two separate pipelines, the Southeast Asia Crude Oil Pipeline (SEAOP) and the Southeast Asia Gas Pipeline (SEAGP), crossing Myanmar from Rakhine state to China and delivering overseas crude and offshore gas to the country’s northern neighbour. The organisation behind the twin pipelines is understood to be a conglomerate majority owned by China National Petroleum Corporation. Other partners include two South Korean firms (Daewoo and Korean Gas Corporation), two Indian firms (Gas Authority of India Limited and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation), and state-run Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise. While the project pumped its first gas in late July, the enterprise has drawn protests over environmental and safety concerns. Protesters also said the contract, which was signed under the military regime, should be revisited and that Myanmar should not export gas when three-quarters of the population lack electricity.The gas pipeline is designed to transmit up to 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas a year, though it will initially transmit only 5.2 billion in the first phase, according to SEAGP.Daewoo/ShweSouth Korea’s Daewoo International started production at the Shwe natural gas field on June 22 of this year, with a pilot operation of its onshore pipeline and sales to Chinese and Myanmar buyers beginning in July. The firm estimates there are 4.5 trillion cubic feet of gas available for exploitation from Shwe, Shwe Phyu and Mya in the A-1 and A-3 blocks, and called it “the largest oil and gas field in scale discovered by a Korean company abroad in the past 30 years” in a statement announcing the start of commercial production.Currently producing some 100 million cubic feet of gas daily, Daewoo says it aims to produce 500 million cubic feet daily by late 2014. The gas is to be sold largely to the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation for the coming 25 to 30 years – equivalent to the daily power usage of 670,000 homes.Daewoo announced the discovery of Shwe in 2004, and the then-military government awarded purchasing rights to China in July 2008. With a controlling interest of Daewoo held by large Korean steelmaker Posco, the firm is also jointly exploring the AD-7 block adjacent to the Shwe field in the Rakhine basin with Woodside Petroleum Ltd of Australia, and has conducted onshore exploration activities as well.MOGEMyanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) is the 100 percent state-owned upstream producer. The firm in its present form dates to 1989, though it is the successor to the nationalisation of the Burmah Oil Company’s Myanmar assets in 1963. MOGE participates in most domestic projects as a joint venture partner, and is regarded as a major source of Myanmar’s state revenue.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Energy is currently conducting a tender for 19 deep water and 11 shallow water blocks. Sixty-one companies are currently reviewing data, including industry heavyweights such as Total and Chevron, with the results of the tender expected to come later in 2013. Ministry officials told The Myanmar Times earlier this month that previous tenders had not drawn this level of international participation due to the sanctions.","/special-features/170-energy/7972-who-s-who-in-offshore-efforts.html"
"342",342,"Rice firms wary of Ministry plans",2013-08-25,"Business","Domestic rice millers and traders say it is too early to open the wholesale market to foreign competition, following signals that the Ministry of Commerce is planning to do so.           “We can’t compete with foreign companies,” said Myanmar Rice Federation’s central executive committee member U Soe Win.“This is not the right time to give them permission to enter the wholesale market. We are just starting to do business openly. Why let them in at this moment?”His comments follow reports that the ministry’s directorate of trade this month began gathering comments and opinions from businesspeople and business-related organisations about opening the wholesale and retail markets to foreign competition.An official from the directorate confirmed the reports. “As we are moving forward we need to open up [the economy] according to trade rules,” said the official who requestedanonymity.“In the past our country’s doors were closed, but now we have to open all of them according to international policies and agreements. We haveinformed [domestic companies] in advance. We did this a long time ago. Local businesses must prepare to compete with [foreign firms]. This competition will occur in the near future, but I can’t say the exact date now,” he said.U Soe Win said Myanmar should be preparing for the creation of the ASEAN economic community in 2015 when members of the association are scheduled to form a single market. “All sectors will open automatically in 2015,” he said.Domestic business people said they are most concerned that Chinese and Thai rice millers and trading companies will drain the profits from the sector because they have better technology and knowhow. Domestic millers say their facilities are inadequate or outdated and that they lack the funds to renovate them or build new ones.The rice sector will be hardest hit, they said, adding that the country’s main agricultural sector should be placed on a protected list.Not all businesspeople share this assessment. Myanmar Rice Federation central executive committee member U Nay Lin Zin said domestic businesses were overprotected. “Too many businesspeople are protected [from competition. We should welcome [foreign] firms in Myanmar,” U Nay Lin Zin added.“We need to take a risk. In the future citizens will earn more profits. The opposition is due to the fact that the rice sector will be affected by the opening of the retail and wholesale markets, but what the sector needs most is more technology and investment,” he said.“The government is calling for input from the businesspeople and stakeholders. At the very least we need to consider what percentage the local partner should commit [to a joint venture with a foreign firm]. Everyone is talking about the AEC in 2015. That’s not too far away. We can’t rush to prepare for it at the last minute so we should start getting ready now,” U Nay Lin Zin said.U Sann Linn, joint secretary general of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, called for a balanced policy. Regulations could both help domestic rice millers and traders compete with foreign firms and open the market at the same time, he said.“Opening the market will be good for consumers,” he said. “Although local businesspeople think they face a risk, we can use tax policy to protect them. Foreign companies should not get tax-free status,” he added.U Sann Linn said the wholesale and retail markets will be opened after the foreign investment law is amended and that the amendments will be based on information collected from domestic businesspeople and other stakeholders.One letter drafted by a rice federation member warns that foreign companies will quickly gain control of the domestic market, and that they will do this one crop at a time. It says that foreign companies are already working in the agriculture sector by registering in the name of Myanmar citizens and that they have manipulated prices of some crops over the past year, putting them out of reach of local consumers.Foreign companies will have a devastating effect on farmers’ livelihoods, the letter says. It urges the government to restrict foreign firms’ activities in the agriculture industry to prevent destruction of rural economies and the profits of domestic firms.","/business/7923-rice-firms-wary-of-foreign-competitors.html"
"343",343,"Transparency concerns led to energy minister swap",2013-08-04,"National News","Concerns over the transparency of new oil and gas concessions were behind the downfall of former Minister for Energy U Than Htay and his deputy, U Htin Aung, sources say.          U Than Htay was transferred to the Ministry of Rail Transportation by presidential order on July 25 and replaced by the railways minister, U Zeyar Aung. U Htin Aung was appointed Deputy Minister for Labour, Employment and Social Security and a replacement has not yet been announced.Several sources contacted last week said the changes were made because of a number of controversial decisions over the awarding of exploration licences and production concessions.One energy expert with more than 30 years’ experience in Myanmar’s oil and gas sector said both local and foreign energy companies had been upset about the decision to give two deepwater blocks, known as MD-7 and MD-8, to Thai company PTTEP earlier this year.“These are considered to be some of the best blocks in the Gulf of Mottama but PTTEP got them without even having to compete in a bidding process,” the expert said.The blocks were not included in a list of 30 offshore fields that the ministry put up for tender in April after PTTEP announced in mid-January it had been awarded the rights to the two fields. The previous month, Chinese state news agency Xinhua quoted Thai Energy Minister Pichai Naripthaphan as saying that U Than Htay had “indicated support” for PTTEP’s proposal for the MD-7 and MD-8 blocks when they met in Nay Pyi Taw on December 20.“I have been told the ministry was going to announce they were awarding MD-7 and MD-8 to PTTEP when they announce the winners of these 30 offshore blocks to make it look as though the process was transparent,” the energy expert said.A former senior official at the Ministry of Energy confirmed that there had been problems in the awarding of blocks and extending existing contracts, as well as allegations of bribery in relation to other energy projects, including pipeline construction.He said the reshuffle had also seen the deputy director general at the Energy Planning Department, U Zaw Aung, transferred to the Ministry of Mines on July 25. In his previous post U Zaw Aung was also director of planning at Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) and oversaw a steering committee at the ministry that reviewed existing Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) and awarded blocks to foreign and local energy firms.Several sources said the ministry had not announced the decision to award the blocks to the Thai company or its negotiations with MPRL E&P to extend its contract to operate the Mann oil field in central Myanmar.According to the sources, both the company and the ministry had been negotiating an extension that would not require it to compete with other firms. “I heard junior officials at [Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise] are not happy about extending the contract with MPRL,” one energy expert said.A retired geologist from MOGE said initially there had been rumours that MOGE would not extend the contract for the Mann oil field, which expires this year, because of its good production levels, but it had indicated it planned to approve an extension without a tender.MPRL E&P is a British Virgin Islands-based company founded by U Moe Myint, a former pilot for U Ne Win. It also holds a number of offshore concessions.A spokesperson for MPRL E&P said that there were no negotiations taking place with the ministry about extending the Mann field contract.“Negotiations are not ongoing, and the ministry and the Energy Planning Department have informed us there are no complaints from [within] the ministry” about the contract.A source close to the Myanmar Investment Commission said no application had been submitted to extend MPRL’s contract for the Mann field.The Ministry of Energy did not respond to requests for comment.","/national-news/7727-transparency-concerns-led-to-energy-minister-swap.html"

Minister for the President’s Office U Hla Tun said at a press conference on July 26 that the project would resume within two months. The expansion, which is expected to take about three years, will enable annual production at the Sagaing Region mine to increase from 40,000 tonnes of copper to 100,000.U Hla Tun announced the details of the new contract to the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw on July 25. The big loser from the new contract appears to be army-owned Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited, which saw its share of the profits from the mine cut from 51pc to 19pc. The main investor, Wanbao Mining from China, will get 30pc, down from 49pc.Wanbao will be required to put aside US$2 million a year for land reclamation, while it will also have to pay $1 million a year for corporate social responsibility projects during construction. After production begins, 2pc of all profits will be kept for CSR.“In the new contract, Mining Enterprise 1 is included in the contract to get more revenue for the state … The state will also get a $5 million signing bonus for the new contract,” U Hla Tun said.“The agreement between these three groups was signed successfully on July 24.”The new contract was recommended by the Letpadaung Investigation Commission set up in November 2012 and led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The previous contract was signed by the military regime in 2010, when former investor Ivanhoe Mines left the project.Minister for Mines U Myint Aung told the hluttaw that the new contract also includes requirements on environmental and social impact assessment reporting. It also clarifies ISO requirements that were only mentioned generally in the original contract.“The new contract is signed to follow the Letpadaung Project Investigation Commission’s recommendation that the weaknesses in the contract be amended,” he said.The commission recommended that environmental and social impact assessments be conducted, and environmental management and occupational health and safety plans be written and implemented.Discussions on the new contract started on April 6, less than a month after the commission released its report. Agreement was reached after 17 meetings.U Aung Tun Thet, a member of the Myanmar Investment Commission, said the new contract meant the copper mine project will be a “model for international investment in Myanmar”.“Every investor has to consider social responsibility in their business,” he added.However, not everyone applauded the new deal. Daw Khin San Hlaing, the Pyithu Hluttaw representative for Pale in Sagaing Region and a member of the investigation commission, said the government should have released the full contract.“U Hla Tun and U Myint Aung came to the hluttaw to explain the new contract on July 25 but MPs do not know exactly what the terms are,” the National League for Democracy representative said. “The government should show more transparency.”Political observer U Yan Myo Thein wrote on his Facebook page that the new contract was not a surprise but praised Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for taking on the tough job of heading the investigation commission.“It was an undeniable fact that Wanbao and UMEHL would have to make some concessions once Daw Suu was involved,” he wrote. “The investigation commission was a political trap and there is only one person who is brave enough to walk into that trap for the interests of the country and the people. That is Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.”For Wanbao, the new contract represented closure on a difficult period. Geng Yi, the managing director of Wanbao’s local subsidiary, said the Chinese company had already spent $600 million in the project. It expects to invest $997 million altogether, he said.‘’We want to restart the project as soon as possible and stop any further losses.”Translated by Thiri Min Htun","/national-news/7644-copper-project-to-resume-in-september-after-new-contract-signed.html"

Reinforcing this with rapid economic development, however, will be a much harder act to follow. It may require a different approach – one that includes the very people U Thein Sein has sought to exclude.Myanmar’s liberation from a half-century of isolation has captivated the world, not least of all because of its undoubted economic potential. But with outbreaks of violence, uncertainties over governance and economic reforms, and the unknowable composition of the next government, it is understandable that many foreign investors are taking a “wait and see” approach. When you factor in over-priced land, a still overvalued exchange rate, a severely constricted domestic market and woefully inadequate infrastructure, only business plans using highly complex random walk algorithms can make the numbers stack up.President U Thein Sein has already achieved his principal objective – international acceptance and legitimacy for Myanmar’s new constitution. However, his reliance on foreigners for the economic follow-through and the distancing of himself from many of Myanmar’s leading business families – whose patriarchs are often referred to as “cronies” for the patronage they enjoyed under the preceding government that he wishes to differentiate himself from – is problematic. Myanmar’s economic take-off – a necessary reinforcement for its nascent democracy - hinges primarily not on foreign economic relations but on the handling of domestic state-business relations.In terms of development priorities, the major challenge for the government after agriculture and the rural sector is to create new jobs through industrial development. As a poor country, Myanmar’s domestic market is small so growth needs to be achieved through exports, both of agricultural commodities produced from labour-intensive family farms and other products from labour-intensive manufacturing. But to be export competitive Myanmar needs a massive upgrade in its infrastructure. The current and former governments have looked to foreign investors to take the lead but this strategy is problematic and unsustainable for two reasons. First, foreign project promoters struggle to manage relations with the military and civilian bureaucracies. Second, if Myanmar people perceive that their national infrastructure has fallen under foreign control a populist politician may emerge to reverse the process.Ports are an example of the first reason why foreign-dominatedinfrastructure development is problematic. The Dawei project has foundered and the Chinese are complaining about the slow progress at Kyaukpyu. At the Thilawa Special Economic Zone, which includes port terminal facilities, the proposed development vehicle is still unregistered and therefore unable to sign a concession agreement. Progress in site development is reliant on Japanese aid. It’s a similar story in terms of power generation, where signed memoranda of understanding collectively account for a 60 percent increase in capacity but nothing has yet progressed to Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) approval. The recent awarding of two mobile phone operating licences to foreign companies is to be applauded but the ease and swiftness of network roll-out remains to be seen.Ports may also offer an example of the second reason: Thilawa for the Japanese, Kyaukpyu for the Chinese, Dawei for the Thais, and something else for the South Koreans and the Americans looks a bit like economic partition. Even foreign-owned energy infrastructure, such as gas pipelines and hydro-electric power plants, could provide raw material for future nationalist populist politicians. The problem is not so much with foreign participation in infrastructure development but with actual orperceived “foreign domination”.An infrastructure upgrade, however, is a precondition for the rapid industrial development necessary for large-scale job creation and political stability. It is in the nature of infrastructure development that the state plays a central role - for strategic planning, regulation of monopolistic concessions and so on - but the private sector is needed for their initiative and greater efficiency. The leadership in infrastructure development should come from Myanmar-owned companies and this makes the management of domestic state-business relations critical. Foreigners have an important role to play in supporting Myanmar businesses in terms of project design and contributing early stage technical and equity capital resources, and later as implementation subcontractors where necessary, but infrastructure development should not be dominated by foreign investment.Given the limits of state capacity and the multitude of bilateral and multilateral development partners calling at their door, government infrastructure development planning will be slow and bureaucratic. Leading local entrepreneurs will not hold their breath waiting for results and will simply refrain from getting involved. Myanmar’s most powerful business conglomerates, which have the experience of getting big projects off the ground and of managing state-business relations effectively, also have many other businesses – such as property development, cement and consumer credit – that can yield satisfactory short-term profits. They know that large infrastructure projects can make them the really big money but these guys are not dreamers. In fact, quite the opposite: They are experts in the art of assessing what is possible. As a result, many of Myanmar’s leading businesspeople are biding their time and concentrating on growing existing businesses.But the economic history lessons of East Asia makes it clear that rapid industrialisation requires a strongly interventionist role from government. The president has to direct national entrepreneurs into activities that yield a high development dividend for the country as a whole rather than just leaving them to their own devices to pursue private profit as they see fit. The national entrepreneurs may not like it but being the richest and most powerful businesspeople in the country comes with responsibilities. And they can also be incentivised by the prospect of joining the same billionaire’s club that their regional counterparts have entered through a similar process.It seems unlikely though that U Thein Sein will suddenly embrace the “cronies” in the cause of national development. U-turns are not easy manoeuvres for politicians and the businesspeople themselves may not be interested in cultivating a politician they perceive as having a limited shelf life. Much-needed administrative reform may absorb much of U Thein Sein’s energy anyway. All eyes are understandably focused on what might be the composition and nature of the next government but rather than speculate on what will happen let’s consider what needs to happen.Now that nearly all sanctions have been lifted and the new constitution enjoys legitimacy at home and abroad, Myanmar’s next president needs to be a strong personality with a keen understanding of the “development state” and the role it must play in harnessing and directing domestic and foreign business to realise national development objectives. If matters are left solely to the public sector it will take too long. The ability of the many thousands of small- and medium-sized enterprises in the country to grow and prosper, augmented by investment from foreign firms, is predicated on the country’s big businessmen delivering on infrastructure. These entrepreneurs have the seed capital, organisation, connections and experience of working with government to take the lead on infrastructure project development, drawing on international technical expertise and capital as necessary. But as well as directing the business patriarchs towards certain types of infrastructure the new president must facilitate international project financing for them too, for which this person needs to understand the nature of global finance.Global finance is divided up into two systems: Non-China finance – the United States dollar-denominated international financial architecture controlled by the US – and China finance. The new Myanmar president must direct Myanmar entrepreneurs to one or the other system depending on whether they are on the US Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. The US has indicated that names do not readily come off its blacklist, which effectively denies individuals and organisations access to the global financial system that it controls.Instead, those on the SDN list must cultivate relations with China sources of project financing – the China Development Bank (CDB) and China Export Import Bank (CEB) – and the non-SDNs must jump through the hoops set by the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC), Asian Development Bank and the Japanese and South Korean development banks.Globally, in 2010 the World Bank/IFC lent about $100 billion, while the CDB and CEB together lent about $110 billion. China also has a foreign financing war chest of $2.4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. Myanmar’s next president can maximise capital inflows for infrastructure by placing the world’s two financial systems in competition with each other. Nay Pyi Taw may work with the two categories of entrepreneurs in different ways. This dual system will be complex for the new president to manage – and often contradictory messages will be sent out to society – but given the nature of the external financing options it is simple pragmatism if the country is to maximise capital inflows for national development and poverty reduction. Indeed, the success of the next president may be evaluated and quantified according to how much infrastructure project financing he manages to pull in because this criteria serves as a reasonable proxy for economic take-off, poverty reduction and performance legitimacy, provided project selection and execution is reasonably efficient.So where does that leave us for the next two years? Well, of course, there is plenty of time for unpleasant surprises and fire-fighting. But there is also the hosting of the Southeast Asian Games to be enjoyed and the chairing of ASEAN next year. There will be plenty of opportunities for high-level socialising as domestic and international political, business and civil society elites contemplate Myanmar’s next crucial phase – the one where the “big money” plays – and strategise and position themselves for it.Stuart Larkin is a policy and investment researcher who has been based in Yangon for more than 17 years.

"347",347,"Is Myanmar’s currency in crisis?",2013-07-22,"Opinion","The dramatic fall in the value of kyat in recent months has raised alarms and left many baffled. The irony is that it was not so long ago a strong kyat caused exporters and those with earnings in foreign currencies to grieve. Apparently neither a strong nor a weak kyat is pleasing and it is not an easy task to keep people on both sides happy. Nonetheless, wide fluctuations in exchange rates erode confidence and harm growth, something Myanmar cannot afford. Meanwhile, some of the most important questions remain largely unanswered.What factors contributed to this decline? What is the future of the kyat? And what are the policy implications?A search of local and international media offers some insights into why the kyat might have fallen so dramatically since it was floated in April 2012. While there is plenty of speculation, there are few concrete answers. One of the most commonly cited reasons is the construction boom and surge in imports, both of which drive demand for the dollar. Some also attribute the decline of the kyat to falling gold prices, while others blame currency speculation and hoarding of the dollar, something many in Myanmar are accustomed to. Perhaps any of these, or all in conjunction, could have contributed to the fall in the kyat. However, one still needs to scrutinise the economic reasoning behind these drivers to address the potential policy implications and the future of the kyat.What determines exchange rates? An exchange rate, like the price of any asset, is determined by its demand and supply. This generally applies to all currencies. Exchange rate regimes do not remain fixed forever and even values of currencies that are supposedly “fixed” could change – and usually during currency crises, such as Thailand in 1997.Demand for kyat primarily comes from exports and from those purchasing kyat-denominated assets. Apparently, demand for dollars primarily comes from imports. Did the import-driven dollar demand contribute to the decline of the kyat? The short answer appears to be yes. International Monetary Fund (IMF) data indicates that Myanmar’s current account – which is the difference between imports and exports for Myanmar because its service sector is negligible – was mostly balanced for 1980 and 2010. However, while exports grew in 2011 and 2012, imports grew much faster, causing the country to have current account deficits of 4.2 percent of gross domestic product and 4.5pc respectively. The expected current account deficits for 2013-14 are 5.1pc and 5.8pc.Economic theory dictates that exchange rates are self-correcting. A weak local currency promotes exports while it deters imports. Stronger exports would increase demand for kyat and given sufficient time this should eventually change the course of the kyat’s decline. Nonetheless, it is possible for countries – one prominent example is the United States – to run persistently large current account deficits as long as these deficits can be financed by other types of capital inflows, mainly from foreign investments. Myanmar currently does not have active financial markets so its foreign investment mostly takes the form of investment in real assets. In Myanmar’s case, the flows from foreign investments exceed the deficit resulting from imports. A recent IMF report indicates that “international reserves will continue rising as foreign direct investment inflows outweigh a widening current account deficit”. Given prospective foreign investors’ interest in Myanmar it is perceivable that this situation will continue into the foreseeable future. In other words, the central bank should possess sufficient reserves to intervene should it decide to do so.How serious is Myanmar’s current account deficit? It is not unusual for emerging economies to run large current account deficits as greater openness and the drive for economic growth accelerate imports. Comparison with some neighbours that have similar development patterns make one suspect that the recent decline in the kyat could be solely attributed to the trade deficits.One more avenue worth exploring is the budget deficit. Budget deficits cause the governments to borrow – or worse, print – money. This increases the money supply, which in turn creates inflation and reduces the value of the currency. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) indicates that Myanmar’s budget deficit for 2012 is 5.4pc of GDP. An active and liquid government bond market (a mechanism for government borrowing) does not exist in Myanmar so a large deficit would undoubtedly put pressure on the value of the kyat. Instituting a more autonomous central bank would calm fears on this part. How does Myanmar fare compared to her peers? ADB data indicate that Cambodia’s fiscal deficit as of 2012 is 5.2pc of GDP. The numbers are -7.9pc and -6.9pc for Laos and Vietnam respectively.Another reason cited is declining gold prices. During times of uncertainties, gold serves as a hedge against inflation and an alternative form of investment. Gold is also considered a safe haven when the banking system is fragile and other investment opportunities are scarce. It is useful to recall that Myanmar has lowered savings rate since the beginning of the period and property prices have spiked. With the decline in gold prices, gold has become an attractive investment. Internationally gold is priced in US dollars and its value has declined by more than 20pc in the past year. Large-scale speculative purchases of gold increase the demand for dollars and, when the dust settles, it worsens the country’s current account deficit. The world’s largest importer of gold, India, faces this issue. Due to the rising trade deficit, the Indian rupee has depreciated by approximately 10pc over the past two months, which parallels the decline in the kyat. India responded by raising import duties on gold.While it is not easy to predict the movement in gold prices, it is unlikely that this trend will continue for an extended period of time. That being said, should saving rates (and gold prices) decline further, this might add pressure on the kyat. While gold prices are volatile and are beyond the control of the local central bank, low inflation could serve as a defence mechanism. A recent IMF report indicates that the expected inflation in Myanmar is 5.5pc for the fiscal year 2013-14. This can be considered low by Myanmar’s historical standards. As financial reforms strengthen Myanmar’s financial institutions and financial markets are further developed, investment would gradually shift away from gold.One overlooked aspect is the impact of the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the drastic fall in Chinese investment in Myanmar in recent years. Chinese investment in Myanmar reportedly fell to about US$400 million in 2012, down from $4 billion and $8 billion in the previous two years. This decline will have had a negative impact on the country’s capital accounts. While the slack will eventually be picked up by other countries, the short-term effects will linger. Slowdowns in China will also affect Myanmar’s exports and therefore the kyat. However, the effect will be minimal as Myanmar runs a large trade deficit with China (approximately $3.5 billion in 2011). Myanmar’s biggest export market is Thailand (39pc), followed by China (approximately 20pc). However, Chinese products account for nearly 39pc of Myanmar’s imports. Kyat depreciation and yuan appreciation is desirable from this perspective.How about the strength of the US dollar? It is also doubtful that this could explain the magnitude of the kyat’s decline. The US Dollar Index, a measure of the value of the dollar relative to a basket of six major foreign currencies, is little changed from a year ago. Neither has the dollar appreciated much compared to Myanmar’s neighbouring and trading partners.There are some other questions important to the currency’s depreciation. Did Myanmar adopt an appropriate exchange rate regime? Did Myanmar float the kyat too early? These are not easy to answer. The exchange rate regime that is most likely to suit a country’s economic interests depends on specific circumstances, such as the size and openness of the country to trade and financial flows. Political conditions and the credibility of its policy makers and institutions are also important factors. There is no single ideal exchange rate regime that is appropriate for all countries. Extreme volatilities cannot be avoided with some floating exchange rate regimes. For countries that are dependent on foreign trade – and have fragile economies and banking systems – extreme volatilities can be a threat to stability.One final question remains: Is the kyat in crisis? It might be a bit premature to say that. Currencies appreciate, depreciate, devalue, and revalue, and most countries, especially the less developed ones, are not immune to it. It should also be noted that Myanmar’s exchange rate market is relatively young and illiquid with thin trading. As a result, a relatively large trade volume could create wide swings in prices. However, it would serve the country well to dampen the extreme volatility and speculation that is occurring. It is the central bank’s job to instil confidence in the local currency by adopting sound policies and taking a proactive approach to curb speculation. This would require better disclosure practices and defending the currency if necessary during times of crisis. Silence is not always golden. Recent history has taught us that excessive speculation is as dangerous as bad fundamentals themselves.Min Thu Maung is an assistant professor of finance in the Department of Finance and Management Science at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.

The world’s largest importer of gold, India, faces this issue. Due to the rising trade deficit, the Indian rupee has depreciated by approximately 10pc over the past two months, which parallels the decline in the kyat. India responded by raising import duties on gold.While it is not easy to predict the movement in gold prices, it is unlikely that this trend will continue for an extended period of time. That being said, should saving rates (and gold prices) decline further, this might add pressure on the kyat. While gold prices are volatile and are beyond the control of the local central bank, low inflation could serve as a defence mechanism. A recent IMF report indicates that the expected inflation in Myanmar is 5.5pc for the fiscal year 2013-14. This can be considered low by Myanmar’s historical standards. As financial reforms strengthen Myanmar’s financial institutions and financial markets are further developed, investment would gradually shift away from gold.One overlooked aspect is the impact of the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the drastic fall in Chinese investment in Myanmar in recent years. Chinese investment in Myanmar reportedly fell to about US$400 million in 2012, down from $4 billion and $8 billion in the previous two years. This decline will have had a negative impact on the country’s capital accounts. While the slack will eventually be picked up by other countries, the short-term effects will linger. Slowdowns in China will also affect Myanmar’s exports and therefore the kyat. However, the effect will be minimal as Myanmar runs a large trade deficit with China (approximately $3.5 billion in 2011). Myanmar’s biggest export market is Thailand (39pc), followed by China (approximately 20pc). However, Chinese products account for nearly 39pc of Myanmar’s imports. Kyat depreciation and yuan appreciation is desirable from this perspective.How about the strength of the US dollar? It is also doubtful that this could explain the magnitude of the kyat’s decline. The US Dollar Index, a measure of the value of the dollar relative to a basket of six major foreign currencies, is little changed from a year ago. Neither has the dollar appreciated much compared to Myanmar’s neighbouring and trading partners.There are some other questions important to the currency’s depreciation. Did Myanmar adopt an appropriate exchange rate regime? Did Myanmar float the kyat too early? These are not easy to answer. The exchange rate regime that is most likely to suit a country’s economic interests depends on specific circumstances, such as the size and openness of the country to trade and financial flows. Political conditions and the credibility of its policy makers and institutions are also important factors. There is no single ideal exchange rate regime that is appropriate for all countries. Extreme volatilities cannot be avoided with some floating exchange rate regimes. For countries that are dependent on foreign trade – and have fragile economies and banking systems – extreme volatilities can be a threat to stability.One final question remains: Is the kyat in crisis? It might be a bit premature to say that. Currencies appreciate, depreciate, devalue, and revalue, and most countries, especially the less developed ones, are not immune to it. It should also be noted that Myanmar’s exchange rate market is relatively young and illiquid with thin trading. As a result, a relatively large trade volume could create wide swings in prices. However, it would serve the country well to dampen the extreme volatility and speculation that is occurring. It is the central bank’s job to instil confidence in the local currency by adopting sound policies and taking a proactive approach to curb speculation. This would require better disclosure practices and defending the currency if necessary during times of crisis. Silence is not always golden. Recent history has taught us that excessive speculation is as dangerous as bad fundamentals themselves.Min Thu Maung is an assistant professor of finance in the Department of Finance and Management Science at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.

"349",349,"Chinese ambassador casts doubt on Myitsone resumption",2013-07-19,"National News","The Chinese ambassador to Myanmar said he is “not confident” that the suspended Myitsone Dam project will be restarted, despite continued lobbying by China Power Investment Corporation.          In an exclusive interview with The Myanmar Times, ambassador Yang Houlan said CPI’s efforts to address concerns surrounding the project, which was suspended in September 2011 for at least five years, have had little impact.“I’m not confident the project can be started,” Mr Yang said on July 17.“For the Chinese company [China Power Investment Corporation], they hope that they can make some progress through the communications and the negotiations, but as for now there has been no progress in this regard,” he said.The head of the embassy’s political section, Gao Mingbo, said that he “didn’t have a clear picture at this stage” whether work would resume on the hydropower dam in 2015, which is the earliest the suspension could be lifted.President U Thein Sein halted the project following fierce opposition from environmentalists, ethnic minority groups and political activists, including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.With 90 percent of the electricity generated to be exported to China, many saw the project as bringing few benefits to Myanmar.Myitsone is not the only China-backed project to face such criticisms. The Letpadaung copper mine, a joint venture between military-owned Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited and Wanbao, and oil and natural gas pipelines linking Rakhine State and Yunnan Province have also been marred by similar accusations.Mr Yang admitted that the approach Chinese companies had taken in the past, which he described as “do more, speak less”, was no longer feasible.“We are not so experienced on how to communicate with local people, how to make more feasibility studies on the environment and issues connected with local p[peoples’ welfare,” said Mr Yang, adding that Chinese firms could learn from how Western companies approach foreign investment.Led by Mr Yang, a seasoned diplomat who arrived in Yangon in March after stints as ambassador in Afghanistan, the Korean peninsula and Nepal, the Chinese Embassy has stepped up its efforts to improve China’s image in Myanmar. As The Myanmar Times has previously reported, the embassy has sought to engage Myanmar internet users through social media, particularly Facebook. It also plans to re-launch its Myanmar-language magazine, China Today, later this month.As part of these efforts, the Chinese-Myanmar Enterprises Association (CMEA), which comprises about 100 Chinese companies that work in Myanmar, issued a new set of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives on July 5 in conjunction with the embassy. The two-page document calls for greater environmental protection, transparency and interaction with local communities in future projects.“We are asking [Chinese companies] to adapt to the new situation,” Mr Yang said.The guidelines show that Chinese companies understand the need to change their practices but the important test will be whether they are adhered to. Mr Yang said the embassy would work to ensure compliance but there is a risk that, however well-intentioned, the guidelines will end up looking like a public relations stunt.While maintaining a smile throughout the interview, Mr Yang was clearly frustrated over the expectations that Chinese companies single-handedly carry out CSR projects with little or no help from Nay Pyi Taw.“There are some things that should be the duty of the government but now the investors have to take charge,” Mr Yang said. He cited schools built by China National Petroleum Corporation along the route of the China-Myanmar pipelines as an example. Mr Yang said that after the schools were built the company received complaints from residents that it had not supplied teachers to staff them.“Teachers are the government’s responsibility. The Chinese company cannot provide teachers for the schools,” Mr Yang said.He said he felt Chinese companies were also unfairly singled out when working on projects with companies from other countries, while the benefits Myanmar could reap from these projects are also rarely reported in the media.","/national-news/7531-chinese-ambassador-casts-doubt-on-myitsone-resumption.html"
"350",350,"Inflation worries are on the rise ",2013-07-15,"Business","With the kyat declining and a speculative boom in the property market driving up the cost of living, economists warn inflation could spiral out of control          Economists are warning that the kyat’s near 10 percent decline against the US dollar this year, coupled with a speculative surge in property prices, could cause inflation to spiral out of control.A weaker kyat is pushing up the cost of imported goods such as fuel, construction materials and raw materials for agriculture like fertiliser, while a real estate boom is also driving up the cost of living, they said.Sean Turnell, a Myanmar economy expert at Australia’s Macquarie University, warned that “asset price inflation” could create a bubble. “This special category of inflation is mostly a function of investor optimism – in other words, of investors speculating that the prices of these assets will increase in the future,” Mr Turnell said.Asset inflation is characterised by prices reflecting speculation rather than fundamentals.Mr Turnell said this type of inflation appears to be very high in Myanmar but rising prices of consumer goods – currently at about 6pc a year – are “more or less okay”, though he added that the kyat’s decline against the US dollar could increase inflationary pressure on consumer goods.Economist U Khine Htun identified fuel and rental prices as the two major drivers of inflation in Myanmar. Rental prices are rising about 10pc every six months, while fuel prices – especially diesel and octane – are dependent on exchange rates because fuel is imported.U Khine Htun said the central bank will have a difficult time controllinginflation.“I don’t think the central bank alone can control inflation and ensure price stability,” he said.U Khine Htun also said the government should be cautious about intervening in the market because markets can correct themselves. He added that skyrocketing prices had cooled demand for property.An official at the Central Bank of Myanmar said that inflation is being monitored to ensure it remains below the savings rate at banks, which is about 8pc.He also said the current inflation rate is far lower than it was in the past and that property prices though rising had not reached the “bubble stage”. He added that property prices will stop rising when they reach their “proper level”, saying the opening of the stock market in 2015 will provide another investment option that may reduce speculation in the property market.Realtors say that speculators dominate the property market to such an extent that reports of plans for new bridges or industrial zones can incite a buying binge. For example, the price of land across the river from central Yangon in Dala township has tripled over the last three months on reports that a bridge will be built connecting it to downtown. Realtors said plots that sold for K1 million earlier this year are now selling for K3 million.Speculators, usually bank executives or Chinese nationals buying through local partners, are the main buyers, they said.Andrea Smurra, a Yangon-based economist with the International Growth Centre, said it is too early to say whether inflation will spiral out of control. He is worried, however, about the impact of inflation on petrol, other energy sources and imported raw materials for agriculture such as fertiliser.“As the currency depreciates, fuel becomes more expensive and a very large range of commodity prices is affected,” Mr Smurra said. “Depreciation will make imported gas more expensive, making the subsidy on electricity even more cumbersome on public finance.”He said rising prices of fuel, electricity and rice could transmit inflation through the entire economy. “Depreciation should be kept under control,” he said. “Myanmar still needs to import fuel and capital goods in order to be able to grow. If the currency depreciates further, export incentives will be offset by Myanmar’s inability to buy commodities [needed to produce exports].”As of July 12, the kyat was trading at 980 to the US dollar. In early May it was trading at about 920 to the dollar. It began sliding after the Water Festival, rising above 940 by end of the month. The exchange rate stabilised in early June before beginning to slide again in the middle of last month. By the end of June the kyat was trading near 980 to the US dollar.","/business/7467-inflation-worries-are-on-the-rise.html"
"351",351,"Ministry rejects Myitsone return request",2013-07-08,"National News","The government has insisted that villagers forced to move for the Myitsone hydro project are not worse off in their new communities but says it will make “further arrangements for them” in cooperation with the Kachin State government.          However, it stopped short of pledging to allow them to return to their former villagers inside the Myitsone project area, despite the president having suspended the dam in September 2011.Residents have complained that housing in two new villages is substandard and the ground is not suitable for cultivation. As The Myanmar Times has previously reported, many risk arrest by returning to their old villages to graze cattle and grow crops.But Deputy Minister for Electric Power U Myint Zaw told the Pyithu Hluttaw on July 3 that the ministry had managed the resettlement “appropriately … based on the terms and conditions of the project agreement”.“It is certain that their new villages are notof a lowerstandard than before. After negotiating with the state government, we will continue to conduct further arrangements for them as much as possible while the hydropower project is suspended,” U Myint Zaw said in response to a question from Daw Dwe Bu of Injangyang constituency in Kachin State.She said that while the Myitsone project has been suspended for almost two years there has been little relief for people displaced by the project, who are strugglingto earn a living and fearful for their future.Residents from Ma Li Zut, Tang Hpre and La Byant villages were moved to Aung Myin Thar Sanpya village, while those from Dow Pan and Aung Jar Yan villages were shifted to Ma Li Yang village.“Most villages in my constituency are included in Myitsone project,” she said. “Whenever I visit them they complain that the new villages are very different from where they lived before.“The residents said that the old villages have good land to grow seasonal crops and it is convenient for their livelihoods and the education of their children.But the land in the new villages ishas a lot of stones and they can’t grow crops.“When the project launched, the officials pledged that the residents will have access to cultivatable land in the surrounding area until the lands are flooded. Because of the president’s goodwill, the Myitsone area has not been flooded but the villagers have not been allowed to cultivate- they have even been barred from accessing their old land so now they are disgusted.”She said additional villages slated for relocation that have not yet moved are also suffering.“For three years the children in these villages can’t go to schoolbecausethe schools have been relocated to Aung Myin Thar village.”Daw Dwe Bu has previously lobbied the government to reconsider its plan for communities in the Myitsone area. In October 2012 she sent a question asking whether the displaced people could be resettled in their original villages and what plans the government was making for their future.In a reply letter, the Minister for Electric Power said that there is currently no plan to let them return to their original villages “because the ministry has to follow terms and conditions of the Myitsone project agreement”, she said.“There are many explanations in the letter but these are just the same as what has already been done in the past. The point is that the residents want to know what their future is,” she said.Responding to criticism of living conditions in the two new villages, the deputy minister on July 3 said the villages had a 24-hour water supply and other facilities, includinga school, hospital, monastery, church, post office, police station and fire brigade building. He said these were built under the memorandum of agreement withthe project’s Chinese backer, China Power Investment,that aimed to “create high living conditions for displaced residents”.“The ministry resettled 408 households from five villagesbetween May 28, 2010 and May 20, 2011 under the agreement. It spent a total of K16.692billion (about US$17 million) to resettle the villages, including construction of infrastructure and homes and compensations for cash crops and orchards. We also give them electricity supply every night,” U Myint Zaw said.Translated by Zar Zar Soe","/national-news/7391-ministry-rejects-myitsone-return-request.html"
"352",352,"Myanmar to renegotiate resource deals",2013-06-25,"National News","The Myanmar government plans to renegotiate billions of dollars of natural resource deals as it imposes tougher environmental standards and clamps down on corruption, a leading US think tank said Monday.          The country's powerful military and Chinese firms could be most affected by the move as the government pursues a radical reform agenda, turning away from decades of junta rule, according to the Asia Society.Myanmar has huge reserves of resources -- ranging from petroleum to tin, timber and precious gems -- which have become notorious for corruption and crony capitalism.""Apparently, the government is preparing to renegotiate all previously agreed-upon projects to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place and to subject future projects to stricter social and environmental controls,"" said a report by the society, which has worked closely with the old junta and new government.Chinese firms dominate the foreign presence in Myanmar and could suffer.""Contracts negotiated with the former government need to be reviewed as the new government enacts new policies and signs on to new international standards, so I don't think anyone is immune to that approach,"" Suzanne DiMaggio, an Asia Society vice-president and co-author of the report, told AFP.DiMaggio said the value of the deals was probably in the billions of dollars, an estimate agreed by other experts dealing with Myanmar.The halting of the Chinese-backed Myitesone Dam in Kachin state in 2011 was ""the first bell indicating that the rules would be changing,"" said DiMaggio.""Now with the development of new investment laws, we should expect that momentum to continue."" Myanmar is a candidate to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which seeks to set international standards in countries with major resource revenues.Since the dam was halted, the government has faced new controversy over a Chinese-backed copper mine development near Monywa in northern Myanmar where there were clashes between security forces and local people last year.The Asia Society said the government will have to work with local communities to make sure all share from the resource profits.It also said the government would have to take tougher action to reduce the military clout in the economy and political life.Despite the change of government to a nominally civilian administration, ""large military companies maintain access to the lion's share of the country's resources and, along with a handful of crony businessmen, dominate the economy.""""Until the military can be removed from its economic domination of the country, both political reconciliation with minority nationalities and economic development are likely to remain elusive,"" the report warned.The report which set out 10 key obstacles faced by President Thein Sein's reforming administration, also said that rooting out corruption would be essential.DiMaggio said the creation of a state anti-corruption committee was an important first step but it would take time to end the corruption and crony capitalism.""Breaking down those structures, it is not going to happen overnight and I think that is one of the reasons why investors are cautious,"" she said.DiMaggio said there was still vital momentum behind the government reforms but that it was crucial that they start producing results for the vast majority of the 55 million population who still live in ""abject poverty.""","/national-news/7264-myanmar-to-renegotiate-resource-deals.html"
"353",353,"Experts question telecom predictions",2013-06-24,"National News","Myanmar’s telecoms industry appears prone to bold claims. When the government launched its telecoms liberalisation process last year, it said the goal was to increase mobile penetration from just 4 percent to 75-80pc by 2015-16. When foreign companies confirmed they had submitted bids for licences earlier this month, they upped the ante, with several saying they could deliver 95pc penetration within years.          The government has since scaled back its growth target to 50pc by 2015 and several industry analysts are also questioning whether the numbers being touted by bidders might be similarly unrealistic.The consortiums that win the two licences are required to have 25pc call and 10pc data coverage within 12 months of launch, and 75pc call and 50pc data coverage within five years. All figures are on a geographic, rather than population, basis.With little accurate population data, it is unclear whether even 95pc coverage on a population basis would meet the 75pc geographic requirement.In a recent report, “Myanmar Telecoms Market: overview and emerging opportunities”, the telecom consultancy firm Analysys Mason said that it was “unlikely” any company could achieve greater than 50pc geographic coverage within three years. The report was based on interviews and surveys carried out by analysts in urban areas over the past year.“We believe strongly in the potential of the market and expect it to outperform many of its nearest neighbours over a comparable timeframe,” co-author Tom Mowat said at the CommunicAsia conference in Singapore earlier this month. “However, it seems unlikely that 50pc penetration can be achieved as per the government’s stated targets due to the lack of infrastructure outside the cities.”Mr Mowat said that while the market is being described as “frontier”, foreign companies may find themselves with unexpected competition. “Operators working in areas close to Myanmar’s borders will need to compete with subscribers currently making use of Thai and Chinese SIM cards and networks that are likely to be superior to their own for the foreseeable future.”Jeremy Rathjen, vice president of Yangon consultancy firm Thura Swiss, said setting up a network would be far from straightforward.He questioned how companies would be able to put up towers in such a limited timeframe when “even to access some [rural] areas the roads are impassable during rainy season. It’s just impractical.”But Mr Rathjen said infrastructure was just one of the challenges foreign companies will find in rural Myanmar. “Does that 95pc [coverage] include the Wa Autonomous Region? [These companies] will have to negotiate with local groups which will not be as open or cooperative as the government,” he said.There is also the lack of a telecommunications law and concerns over competition from local operators. However, Mr Rathjen said these questions were less interesting to Thura Swiss than what the larger process represents. He said that the manner in which the tender had been handled to date would boost Myanmar’s chances of attracting foreign investment.The government has so far “done a very good job” in terms of ensuring transparency and meeting deadlines and this would boost investor confidence in its management skills.“The oil and gas tenders are not nearly as transparent,” he said. “This [tender process] is a good litmus test on where the country is.”","/national-news/7199-experts-question-telecom-predictions.html"

The new policy went into effect on March 6. Prior to March 6, foreign nationals could only withdraw from their foreign-currency accounts two days a week.The policy also extended withdrawals to private banks.“Withdrawals of foreign currency were only allowed in state-owned banks, but we are now allowing withdrawals at private banks,” said U Han Min Soe, the FEMD’s director on March 14.Foreign-currency accounts can be opened in three state-owned banks – Myanma Economic Bank, Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank and Myanma Foreign Trade Bank – and 14 private banks.The Myanmar Central Bank allowed the 14 private banks to offer foreign-currency accounts initially in May 2012, and authorised dealer licenses the following July. The Bank removed restrictions for remittance in November 2013 and now allows remittances Monday through Friday.“We are trying to adhere to international bank [best] practices. We have opened up transactions at private banks as much as we have at state-owned banks, and it’s totally different than in the past,” U Han Min Soe said.However, foreign nationals are still not allowed to open savings accounts at state-owned or private banks.The withdrawal limit is still set at US$10,000.

Some banks have requested Chinese yuan, Japanese yen and Thai baht from the Myanmar Central Bank to remit in their banks, he added.","/business/5179-foreign-withdrawals-expanded.html"

But lions do not come cheap: each performance costs from K300,000-K1 million.“We need to invest in our costumes and they need to changed yearly,” he said.Some costumes are handmade, while some are imported from Singapore. The owner of one dragon dance costume shop told The Myanmar Times that dragon dance groups invest about K8 million a year in costumes and props.“Dragon dance groups always change their costumes and suit design for their performances every year,” he said.And February is the big month for dance competitions. This year Junction Square shopping mall is hosting a three-day competition starting February 6 that Sint O Dan Road in Latha township will celebrate five days of competition starting February 11, said Ko Zaw Min Htut, the leader of Blue Blood dragon dance group.But getting to competitions is neither easy nor cheap. Dance groups usually hire two vehicles and about 15 labourers to carry their costumes and iron frames to shows and competitions. Each vehicles costs up to K50,000 a day while each labourer costs K5000 a day.The high costs mean some groups have fallen on hard times.“This year there are only about half the competitions there are last year and show invitations have declined, so it’s harder to cover our investment,” Ko Zaw Min Htut said.","/business/4066-traffic-hits-bottom-line-for-dance-troupes.html"
"359",359,"Shan State tea farmers struggle against imports, loss of workers",2013-02-11,"Business","China’s hunger for women is at least partly to blame for a reduction in Myanmar’s dried tealeaf production, the spokesperson for an industry association said last week.          Most of Myanmar’s tea is grown in Shan State but demand for brides in China is drawing away many of the workers needed to cultivate the crop, farmers from the Palaung Tea Growers and Sellers Association, which is not officially recognised as yet, told a meeting at the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry on February 6.Namhsan, Kyaukme, Namkham, Kutkai, Kalaw, Yatsouth, Mong Hsu and Mong Tone townships in Shan State are the major tea growing areas, with most farming done by members of the Palaung ethnic group.“When Chinese dried tea leaf flooded the market in 2002-03, our business was badly affected because the two products were so different,” said U Soe Maung, a farmer from Namhsan township. “The market for dried tea dried up and there were no jobs available for young Palaung and Shan women, and many chose to get married to Chinese men instead,” he said, adding that Chinese men paid up to 20,000 yuan (about US$3200) to marry the women.He said Chinese tea farmers can afford to use lots of fertiliser on their crops but farmers in Myanmar cannot. He added that farmers would get better yields if cut terraces into the hills but many cannot do so.“Most of the dried tea leaf imported from China is illegal. But imports make up about 75 percent of the market, so most farmers have changed their operations to make wet tea leaf for use in salads,” he said.U Soe Maung said there are 10 factories in Namhsan township producing dried tea, down from 100 in 2002.U Win Kyaw, another farmer from Namhsan, said many Chinese from Shweli, as well as workers from central Myanmar, came and worked tea plantations eight years ago but the trend has reversed.“Now Palaung men go to China and work at poppy fields or cutting sugar cane as daily workers because there is little work here,” he said.Tea plantations are long-term investments and require significant capital to maintain. “We cannot afford to maintain our plants already but we need to make investment if we want to harvest high-quality leaf,” he added.However, U Tun Myaing, the chairman of the association, said farmers need to work harder and more efficiently. “There are many drug users in every Palaung village. Farmers should focus on growing only tea, not growing illegal opium poppies on the side,” he said.“We should be better organised as an association and work hard to lift quality levels so we can compete with China, Vietnam and India,” he said.He added that the easing of Western sanctions, and the possibility of the European Union granting Myanmar global system of preferences for Least Developed Country status, tea growers stood a good chance of accessing new markets. But to do so they must improve quality.“That is the only way to solve human trafficking and the illegal marriage of Palaung and Shan women,” he said.Ministry of Home Affairs statistics, collected by the Central Body for Suppression of Trafficking in Persons, show that Shan State has accounted for most of the human trafficking cases over the past five years. The statistics show that 80 percent of human trafficking cases involve people who have been taken to China.","/business/4063-shan-state-tea-farmers-struggle-against-imports-loss-of-workers.html"
"360",360,"Renewed focus on industrial zones",2013-02-04,"Property News","Some of Yangon Region’s prime industrial zones are developing quickly thanks to local and foreign investment in factories, real estate agents said in January.          U Thant Sin, of New Moon real estate agency, said that infrastructure in the more popular industrial zones of Shwe Than Lwin, Hlaing Tharyar, East Dagon and Dagon Seikkan is developing fast.“Hlaing Tharyar Industrial Zone 5 was almost empty in the past. But now there are buildings, roads and lamp posts on the main roads. Businesses are building strong fences around their plots. The zone is expanding its capacity by 30 percent,” he said on January 16.He also added that demand from Asian investors for land in industrial zones was driving up prices, making it a sellers’ market.U Thant Sin said land at the Hlaing Tharyar industrial zones 1, 2, 3 and 4 is selling for about K500-600 million an acre, while more remote industrial zones can range from K350-400 million an acre. Hlaing Tharyar Industrial Zone 7 has the highest prices at K650-750 million an acre. Land prices in underdeveloped zones such as East Dagon and Dagon Seikkan are about K200-K250 million an acre, he said.U Win Maung from Koe Knat Huakwe real estate agency in Hlaing Tharyar township said new investors are following the lead of Chinese and Vietnamese companies that have rented land in recent years, and expected more would soon follow.“China and Vietnam invested in [Myanmar’s] industrial zones many years ago. But now there are more investors from Japan and South Korea, and Cambodian companies are starting to invest here,” he said.“Investors are interested in the Shwe Lin Pan and East Dagon industrial zones because they are developing. If we had more developed industrial zones, we could attract more investors,” he added.But some areas have missed the boom. “Some industrial zones, like East Dagon and Kyan Sitha [in Hlaing Tharyar township], need twice as much infrastructure as they have. We’re operating at under 50 percent of what we could be,” U Khin Maung Aye, spokesperson for Myanmar Property said on January 10.With the exception of popular industrial zones like Hlaing Tharyar, Shwe Pyi Thar and Shwe Lin Pan, many industrial zones have been left undeveloped for years, he added.But U Khin Maung Aye also highlighted the effects of uncertainties surrounding the unfinished Foreign Investment Law and Myanmar’s ongoing ethnic conflicts on slowing the pace of development.“The actual rules and regulations of the Foreign Investment Law have not been enacted yet,” he said. “The conflicts in the country might also be a barrier for investors. Many people wouldn’t care about this as their business would be in Yangon [a safe area] but a lot of people care about the political situation in a country they are going to invest.”","/business/property-news/3999-renewed-focus-on-industrial-zones.html"
"361",361,"As report deadline looms, Letpadaung protesters prepare for dashed hopes",2013-01-21,"National News","An uneasy calm has descended over the Letpadaung issue, as residents and activists await the outcome of the commission of investigation set up by the government after a series of violent clashes.          The commission, chaired by Aung San Suu Kyi, is due to submit its report by January 31. At a press conference on December 6, Aung San Suu Kyi pledged that her investigation would serve the long-term interests of the country but she also warned that not everyone would be satisfied with the commission’s findings.Wanbao Mining, a Chinese company, has run the copper mine at Salingyi towship in Sagaing Region since 2010, in cooperation with army-owned Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Company Limited (UMEHL). A planned US$1 billion expansion would consume thousands of acres of farmland.Since then, conflicts have broken out between the mine’s operators and local villagers over issues such as land acquisition, compensation, and the mine’s environmental, social, and health impacts. A sharp escalation occurred on November 29, 2012, when police violently dispersed protesters, including monks, who were demanding a halt to the expansion. The police and government subsequently apologised for the incident.On December 1, the Office of President U Thein Sein formed a 30-member investigation team to establish the facts and to look into whether the Letpadaung expansion should continue and file a report by the end of December. Two days later it was re-established with 16 members and given a month longer to investigate.As the commission prepares to issue its report, public interest has intensified.“We expect Amay Suu to do her best for us. We don’t blame her and won’t hate her if the outcome doesn’t meet our wishes. We know Amay Suu doesn’t have the power to stop the project completely,” said Ma Thwe Thwe Win of Wattmhaty village, using the Myanmar word for mother to refer to Aung San Suu Kyi.“We hope for the best, but we’re prepared for the worst,” she added.Like Ma Thwe Thwe Win, most residents in the Letpadaung area have suspended their protest out of respect for Aung San Suu Kyi as they await the commission’s findings. Many say they want the mine closed, and will not negotiate with Wanbao or with UMEHL, both of whom they distrust.On January 11, the commission announced that it had engaged two experts to review the contracts signed between UMEHL and Wanbao and received a preliminary report from the Myanmar Environmental Science Group (MESG), which it formed to look into the ecology, social aspects, cultural heritage, project management and development analysis at Letpadaung. Commission members have visited villages in the area and worked with the government to ensure those injured in the November 29 attack receive proper medical treatment.“We’re satisfied with the commission’s activities. But we don’t think they’ve had enough time for a thorough investigation. I think there will be confrontation between the government and the public if the commission doesn’t decide in the people’s favour,” said Sayadaw U Sandar Thiri, of San Mya Wadi Monastery in Zeedaw village.Activists who led the protest campaign in Yangon and elsewhere say they are ready to act in response to the commission’s findings.“Local and international opinion accepts that the project should be stopped. We are ready to continue our campaign,” said Ko Ye Lin, who faces trial in connection with the protest.Others have already thrown down the gauntlet in advance of the January 31 report.“We don’t trust U Thein Sein or Daw Suu. I think Daw Suu is on the cronies’ side,” said Ko Aung Soe, a member of the Public Service Network (Yangon).“We have some hope of getting the answer we want, so we’re we preparing for the best. We don’t want to say more about our plans now,” said Ko Wai Lu, another Public Service Network member.Wanbao Mining Company says it plans to invest $1 billion at Letpadaung over 30 years. The government says it will receive 16.8 percent of the profits, UMEHL 13.8pc and Wanbao will take 13.3pc. It is not clear where the remaining 56.1pc will go.U Maung Maung Tint, project director of Myanmar Wanbao Mining Copper, told a press conference on September 26 that the expansion will allow the mine to produce about 100,000 tonnes of 99.9pc pure copper a year, while 78pc of workers will be Myanmar.However, the villages of Wattmhay, Zeekone, Seltel and Kantkaw will be displaced by the project. The companies say they have paid more than $5 million in compensation in respect of more than 6000 acres.China’s ambassador to Myanmar has said his government would accept the outcome of the Letpadaung Investigation Commission if it is balanced and accurate, but has also warned that if the project is cancelled, it could damage the climate for foreign direct investment.As the January 31 deadline approaches, residents in the camps they opened last month in Tone Ywa village are biding their time. “People from 16 villages have come to stay in the camps, but not to mount a protest campaign. We await the answer,” said Ma Aye Aye Khing of Tone Ywa village. “If they won’t stop the project, we will fight as hard as we can to stop it,” she said.","/national-news/3859-as-report-deadline-looms-letpadaung-protesters-prepare-for-dashed-hopes.html"
"362",362,"The fiscal year in review: 2012 - 2013",2012-12-31,"Business","The government’s efforts to reform the long-dormant economy and tackle endemic poverty through 2011 and 2012 have failed to reach the intended targets, sources said last week.          Since the new government took power in March 2011, the government has swiftly liberalised the economy by cutting red tape for import/export businesses, allowed domestic banks to open automatic teller machines and partner with foreign lenders to offer international transfers, opened the car and cooking oil import markets, enacted an amended foreign investment law and repeatedly invited foreign investment.At the same time, it has strengthened democratic principles and allowed its people to voice opposition to major projects such as the Myitsone dam in Kachin State and more recently the Letpadaung copper mine in Monywa, in Sagaing Region.The international community has taken note, as witnessed by United States President Barack Obama visiting the country on November 19, and the gradual easing of economic sanctions through 2012. Huge American companies, such as General Electric, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, have responded to the easing of sanctions by entering the country in search of profits.In late 2012, to a casual observer it might appear that the changes have been rapid and vast. But economic experts within the country say many of the alterations have only been on paper, and have not affected the majority, especially the farmers living in rural areas who make up most of the population.Local economists say the government spent considerable effort and time in 2012 fighting corruption and a lack of transparency, increasing the accountability of bureaucrats, reducing cronyism and fighting illegal trade.Emphasis has also been placed on fixing hardware problems though commissioning better transportation systems, telecommunication networks and improving electricity distribution. In these efforts the government has sought, and been provided, technical assistance from international institutions.However, the increased international attention on Myanmar’s economy has also had strongly negative impacts on the tourism and property sectors, local economists and experts said this year.Rental rates for hotel rooms, as well as prime residential and office spaces, have skyrocketed, catapulting Yangon to 35th on international ratings agency Mercer’s cost of living for expats index, released in June 2012.In April, the Central Bank of Myanmar finally axed its pegged rate for the national currency and replaced it with a manage floatation set via daily currency auctions with private banks. The move saw the much-ridiculed K6-to-the-dollar exchange rate replaced by a market rate, which was K845 last week. The floatation is part of a broader plan being implemented with advice provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to unify the different exchange rates available in the country, which the fund previously estimated to number more than 15.Foreign economists said Myanmar’s economy cannot realistically grow further until its banking sector is modernised, and for that to happen the Central Bank needs to be made independent. Additionally, private banks must boost their loan and capital portfolios to extend more credit to businesses and farmers.Dr Sean Turnell, an associate professor of economics at Australia’s Macquarie University, said Myanmar’s economy will have grown in 2012 at slightly higher rate than previous years, with energy, precious stones, and resource exports the primary drivers. He added that tourism will also have contributed a significant boost over past years.But Dr Turnell said the effects of the economic reforms will be slight.“Such reforms are still in their very early stages, and to some extent are just necessary steps to other reforms that could become the real drivers of transformational growth,” he said. “But the latter are not yet in place.”He added that there are many small measures that can be taken to deliver quick benefits and swing popular support behind an economic reform program. These include removing some restrictions on banks that disallow them from providing capital to farmers and cultivators; moving quickly to lower prices on SIM cards, and bring in competition in the telecommunications sector; act to ensure that all remaining government controls on farmers (especially those that tell them what, when and how to grow) are removed; publishing a detailed set of public accounts that includes both revenue and spending items in order to better ensure transparency and accountability in public finance; modify the Farmland Bill to give genuine security of land tenure to farmers; end the system of import licensing that unnecessarily increases the prices of desired and necessary imports, encourages cronyism, and keeps the kyat artificially high by restricting the demand for foreign currencies.“Of course, there are more foundational and long-term measures to be enacted to but all of the above can be put in place straight away, and deliver quick, positive returns,” he said.    In terms of the government’s budget allocation, the former regime’s budget was complicated and difficult to track, he said. It contributed only about 3 percent for health and 5pc for education until the 2012-13 fiscal year.In early November, the amended foreign investment law was enacted, ending months of wrangling between parliamentarians, the business community, Myanmar Investment Commission and President U Thein Sein.Some foreign companies have already entered the market, even though more specific investment rules are yet to be determined.Myanmar must encourage investment that brings development and jobs to its people to catch up with the region after 50 years of mismanagement, said economist U Khine Htun.To do so, Myanmar needs to harness its natural resources and use them to develop new industries beyond the extractives sector that also bring knowledge and learning to its people.Modernising the agriculture sector should be the top priority since it employs so many people and could be a source of significant foreign exchange earnings. Improvements would also deliver food security and provide a reliable foundation for Myanmar to move into processing, light manufacturing and other sectors, according to Dr Turnell.“The situation is different now than it was in the past. However, clearly aspects of the ‘old Myanmar’ continue to haunt the new, as the problems with old deals with Chinese state-owned firms amply illustrate,” Dr Turnell said.“Likewise, there have as yet been few reforms in critical areas that impact most upon the lives of normal people. The lack of improvement in agriculture is especially striking, especially given that the sector could be lifted mightily simply by lessening state intervention,” he said.  Ministry of Commerce consultant Dr Maung Aung said every ministry has been reforming. The Ministry of Commerce, for example, has been trying to create a level playing field for traders to halt price fixing, and has also liberalised trade licensing and cut red tape.“We can see the government trying to be fair in trade like other nations, which we’ve never seen before,” he said.However, the government faces concerted resistance from the people on some projects, such as Myitsone dam and the Letpadaung copper mine, as well as an ethnic conflict in Rakhine State and armed conflict in Kachin State.“These may be barriers for foreign investment but we need global trade and investment to help us to escape from being a poor country,” he said.Dr Maung Maung Lay, vice president of Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI), said international attention had centred on Myanmar in 2012.“Economic reform will come after political reforms; international businessmen think of Myanmar as the gateway between China and India, where there is a very big market,” he said.“But investors still complain about the country’s reluctance to liberalise property lending, and poor transportation and telecom services. We need to upgrade [these sectors], and not move backwards and away from foreign investment,” he added.","/business/3675-the-fiscal-year-in-review-2012-2013.html"

With the sport in a delicate state in this country the team realises their performance will have consequences back at home.“The result of this tournament is very important”, said U Hla Oo in Yangon before the side departed. The squad has been preparing since March this year, with training intensifying the past month.The Myanmar Cricket Federation (MCF) desperately wants to give the sport a promotional push next year by having the team play in front of a home crowd at the South East Asian Games. However that vision will be in jeopardy without good performances in northern Thailand.Future funding from the ACC is directly tied to the placing in this competition.The tournament runs through Thursday December 13 across three venues in Chiang Mai. Seven teams from the third tier of Asian cricket nations are competing. Myanmar has been placed in Group B along with Bahrain, Qatar and China. Group A sees Thailand, Singapore, and Iran jostle.The top two teams in each group will advance to the semi finals, with the final to be played at Traidhos Oval. But the trip is off to a rough start, Myanmar lost to Qatar by eight wickets after mustering only 54 in its innings on December 7.This is Myanmar’s third ACC Trophy Challenge tournament. The 2009 and 2010 events saw the team beaten soundly by more experienced nations. The national team is currently ranked 18th in Asia. The coach is a former professional cricketer from Bangladesh, Ashfaq-ul-Islam.Cricket is an internationally popular sport. Its World Cup enjoys the third largest global television audience after the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, according to the Wisden cricket almanac. Players from all over the world are recruited by the Indian Premier League on contracts worth millions of US dollars to play in packed stadiums.Such is the globalisation of the sport that China has recently embarked on an aggressive programme to develop its domestic scene. The authorities there view cricket as a way of competing for “soft” power with its Asian rival India.Starting from almost a zero player base in 2004, the Chinese Cricket Association aims to qualify for the World Cup by 2019, according to ESPN CricInfo. China’s first ever international victory came against Myanmar in the 2009 ACC Trophy Challenge.Despite fever-pitch adoration of the game in neighbouring India and Bangladesh, and the massive investment in China, in Myanmar cricket has struggled for acceptance as anything more than an imperial relic.British officials played cricket in Myanmar during the colonial era. European teams and even the historic Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) toured the country in the early 20th century.“[It] was a pre-test tour to India for the most part,” MCC spokesperson Neil Robinson told The Myanmar Times by e-mail of the two matches played in Yangon in 1927. “There don’t seem to have been any actual Burmese playing for Burma or Rangoon Gymkhana. The three non-English players on the national team appear to be Indian Muslims.”The sport died out after independence, but the last decade has seen an attempted revival. Aside from expatriate activities, the last few years the MCF has been promoting the game throughout Myanmar via schools. This year saw eight boys teams and six girls teams from all over the country participate in youth competitions, said U Hla Oo.Myanmar was admitted to the ACC in 2005 and the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2006. Last December saw a dedicated ground for the sport constructed at Saw Pong, on the outskirts of Yangon.The match against China on Monday is a big occasion for the national team. U Hla Oo predicted that is the most realistic chance of Myanmar securing its first ever international win at senior level. He said he was proud that the current team consists of all Myanmar-born players, and that would make any success even sweeter.","/sports/3508-myanmar-cricket-struggles-for-survival.html"
"364",364,"Domestic banks not ready for joint ventures",2012-12-10,"Business","Domestic banks lack the capital to take part in international banking, despite receiving permission to do so last July from the Central Bank, sources say.          According to a draft law released in November, the Central Bank is likely to allow private banks to open representative offices overseas. But Co-operative Bank managing director U Pe Myint said private banks have yet to develop plans to do so.At the same time, despite the recent passage of the foreign investment law, foreign banks are not going to be opening functioning branches in Myanmar any time soon, as legal and technical restrictions remain.Central Bank deputy director general U Win Thaw said the bank would develop specific rules and regulations for the entry of foreign banks after setting general targets this month.“Some foreign banks want to open branches here straight away, but our regulations say they must first pass through three steps (representative office, subsidiary and joint-venture). There are also said to be software problems,” he said.U Win Thaw added that Myanmar’s 19 private banks are enough for the country’s banking sector, but they have too few branches.Asia Green Development (AGD) Bank managing director U Ye Min Oo said domestic banks are too small to compete with international banks. A big Myanmar bank could have less capital and fewer branches than one of Thailand’s smallest banks, he said.“Foreign banks intend to cooperate with Myanmar banks in joint ventures permitted by the Central Bank. But they’re waiting for the rules and regulations,” he said.“When we think about joint-venture banking, we have to think who contributes how much in terms of share ratio, how to select the board of directors, the CEO or managing director, and which services we can offer. Many of those things are still at the discussion stage,” he said.There are about 300 towns in Myanmar and the biggest Myanmar bank, Kanbawza, has fewer than 80 branches. Private banks still have a long way to develop in-country, let alone opening representative offices in other countries, U Ye Min Oo said.“No-one will take a risk in overseas banking without profit,” he said.Dr Sein Maung, chairman of First Private Bank, said a Chinese bank had recently approached him about possible cooperation.The Chinese bank had about US$240 billion in capital, and his bank has about K30 billion (about $36 million). He said the Central Bank had to decide what the equity share ratio would be for each side.“The foreign investment law does liberalise the contribution ratio for joint-venture projects, but we’re still awaiting the decision from the Central Bank on that,” he said.He added that K30 billion is tiny compared to foreign banks’ capitalisation, and domestic banks would need more in order to work foreign banks.There are 23 representative banks in Myanmar from 11 countries, including Japan, South Korea, India, China and Thailand.","/business/3510-domestic-banks-not-ready-for-joint-ventures.html"
"365",365,"US-Myanmar ties: beware the backlash",2012-11-26,"Opinion","United States President Barack Obama’s visit to Myanmar last week highlights how much has changed over the past two years in the relationship between the world’s lone superpower and a country that has been one of the world’s most inwardly focused. But even in this moment of mutual success, the US and Myanmar should be wary of the potential for disappointed expectations to combine with autarkic (self-isolating) and xenophobic trends in Myanmar’s political culture and create a backlash.          Long-term economic and social mismanagement in Myanmar means that the US-led developed world offers an idealised model, as well as an idealised pathway for Myanmar to reach that model. The US and its allies are societies that many in Myanmar aspire to become more like, and it is through trade, investment, technology transfer and knowledge sharing that this hoped-for transformation in Myanmar will occur. But the political and economic systems of the developed world are not a panacea for the many social and economic ills that trouble Myanmar.When it becomes apparent that re-engagement with developed world capitalism will not only fail to solve existing problems but also creates new ones, seemingly discredited ideas from Myanmar’s past may once again become important.In Myanmar, expectations for the reforms and concomitant re-engagement with the developed world are unrealistically high. These include expectations for economic growth, and for how that growth will affect material and social conditions. Emblematic of this sentiment is President U Thein Sein’s call for Myanmar to triple its per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) by 2016. This would require growth of more than 25 percent a year, a rate that would be little short of miraculous.Such unrealistic expectations can also be seen in the spirit underlying the electricity protests over the summer. The abysmal state of the electricity grid in Myanmar is not something that can be fixed simply by the will of the government to do so and it also cannot be fixed overnight. But the sudden break from long isolation and the breakneck pace of political opening make even the miraculous seem possible, if not probable.High expectations also cluster around improvements that Western companies will bring to business practices in Myanmar. The hope is that the contrast with what noted Mandalay writer, Daw Ludu Amar, has called the lawpan khit, or “era of the Chinese boss”, will be stark. Myanmar’s reliance on China for imports of finished goods, infrastructure development and energy investment has brought to the fore resentment about how Chinese businesses operate in the country. Chinese products are a byword for poor quality, humorously shown in the popular Myanmar saying “ti yoke set, ti yet soke” (“Chinese machine, broken in one day”). Chinese resource extraction companies are decried as wantonly looting and polluting. Popular belief holds that the companies are able to get away with these practices because they have bribed venal government officials. These conditions raise the hope that the re-entry of Western companies will bring less corruption and better stewardship of both natural resources and the environment.Undoubtedly, those Western firms that do enter the Myanmar market are likely to be better on conservation and corruption but ultimately, as profit-making enterprises, they will have to adapt to the local business culture and conditions more than change them, particularly at first. Furthermore, low-quality Chinese products will continue to dominate many market segments for the same reason they do around the world: price.The overall result is that both quantitative and qualitative changes in Myanmar’s economic life are likely to disappoint widely held expectations. More crucially, the close links between Myanmar’s reforms and its opening to the US and its allies mean that disappointment in Myanmar is likely to focus on Western companies. This will be exacerbated by the conspicuous success of a few Western firms, and the invisibility of the losses of those many that do not succeed in Myanmar’s challenging business environment.Autarkic and xenophobic trends in modern Myanmar political culture make the possibility of a disappointment-triggered backlash against the US and its allies more likely. These trends have their roots in the colonial experience. The establishment of British colonial control over what had been the independent Konbaung kingdom coincided with a peak in the first wave of globalisation before the First World War.British control brought the former Konbaung lands into deepening and expanding networks of international trade and migration. The growth of the commercial capitalist economy in British Burma coincided with large-scale immigration, mainly from India and China. The small community of Europeans were at the top of society, while Indian and Chinese groups controlled much of what constituted the modern commercial economy. The predominantly rural and agrarian Bamar population became economically marginal in their own homeland. This was the plural society famously described by scholar and colonial official JS Furnivall.Burma’s struggle for independence was also a struggle against the economic marginalisation of the Bamar people. The ultimate negation of the commercial, capitalist and immigrant-receptive British Burma was General Ne Win’s governments under the Revolutionary Council and the Burma Socialist Program Party. These governments were socialist and isolationist, and set immigration control as a priority. Underlying the broad policy directions of the Ne Win era was schema describing Burma’s place in the world.This schema was that Burma’s abundant natural wealth and strategic position made it a draw for covetous outsiders who would work with self-interested internal elements to secure control. This schema is still very much alive in Burmese politics today. The US and its allies will easily slot into the role of covetous outsiders, and the reformers that of their domestic henchmen, when disappointment with the results of the reforms and concomitant opening sets in.This schema underlies two major, but opposed, positions in Bamar politics under the post-1988 Tatmadaw governments. Popular perceptions have been that the leadership of the Tatmadaw was selling out the country to the Chinese for personal gain. Here the Tatmadaw leadership are the domestic henchmen and the Chinese the covetous outsiders.Conversely, the post-1988 Tatmadaw governments argued that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy were stooges of a neo-colonial West. This position, which sees the West as covetous outsider, abetted by the democratic opposition, has never been popular and is now almost entirely discredited. But when disappointment with the results of the reform process sets in this position could provide the core of a revived isolationist and nationalist narrative.The question then becomes what can be done to forestall a backlash against the US and its allies. For the West, the first step is to understand Myanmar’s historical experience. Myanmar should not be seen simply a pawn in a struggle with China. Myanmar needs to be understood on its own terms and that understanding needs to inform Myanmar policy.The key is to help Myanmar cultivate an inclusive and outward-looking nationalism to replace the schema developed out of the colonial experience. To this end President Obama should reach out to elements in the Tatmadaw and Union Solidarity and Development Party because it is from within their ranks that leaders of an isolationist push would likely come.If the reforms and better relations with the US and its allies benefit these groups too, they are less likely to dust off inward-looking nationalist rhetoric and try once again to lead the country into xenophobic autarky.Josh Gordon is a PhD candidate in anthropology at Yale University.

"366",366,"Myanmar parliament approves Letpadaung mine probe",2012-11-24,"National News","The Pyithu Hluttaw has unanimously approved a motion to form an independent commission to investigate the Letpadaung copper project in Sagaing Region and whether a planned expansion should be allowed to proceed.          The mine has been the focus of months of protests, with residents angry at the confiscation of thousands of acres of farmland for the expansion, which has been halted because of the unrest.The extraordinary motion, presented on Friday, November 23, the final day of the fifth session of parliament, was sponsored by National League for Democracy member Daw Khin San Hlaing, the representative for Pale in Sagaing Region.While Minister for Defence Lieutenant General Wai Lwin defended the conduct of the project’s investors, including military-owned Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL), and told the hluttaw it was not necessary to form the committee, he was overruled.The motion called for the formations of “an independent, national-level commission composed of individuals and organisations trusted by the public and local and foreign experts and organisations”, which would investigate the Letpadaung expansion, as well as existing mines at Sabetaung and Kyisintaung, and then issue public findings and recommendations.The motion also called on the “Pyithu Hluttaw to urge the president to assess whether [the Letpadaung expansion] should be allowed to continue and, if allowed, how it should be done” based on the findings of the commission.The commission should consider the effects of the project on society and environment, the measurable and non-measurable short- and long-term benefits for the state and the people, and will of the public, the motion said.The Letpadaung deposit has 1.478 billion tonnes of copper ore with a copper content of 0.38 percent, as well as about 577 million tonnes with 0.44pc copper, according to 2007 estimates, making it the largest deposit in Southeast Asia.In 1996, Canadian company Ivanhoe and the Ministry of Mines formed a joint venture called Myanmar Ivanhoe Copper Company Limited with an equity ratio of 50:50 and produced copper from the Sabetaung, Sabetaung South and Kyisintaung deposits.In 2006, it produced as much as 39,000 tonnes of pure copper and in 2006 and 2007 earned US$112 million and $160 million respectively.After Ivanhoe divested its share, the ownership “fell into the hands of” UMEHL, hluttaw representatives were told, and more than 14,000 acres were acquired for the Letpadaung expansion and villages, monasteries and schools were forced to move.“Though peasants were given compensation of three times the value of cultivated crops, social life, health and the power of human spirit deteriorated. The environment was badly damaged. So the local people strongly protested against it and people all over the country extensively supported their objection,” the motion said.In his clarification regarding the motion, Lt Gen Wai Lwin said that profit from the project was shared between the government (16.55pc), UMEHL (13.15pc) and Myanmar Yang Tse Copper Ltd (12.63pc), a subsidiary of Chinese arms manufacturer Norinco.The other 57.67pc covers production costs, including investment, the minister said.Profit is calculated based on annual production of 25,000 tonnes and a London Metals Exchange price of $6250 a tonne. Last week copper closed the exchange at $7716 a tonne.The minister also said the investors are “providing social, educational and healthcare assistance to local people” and “using world-standard management practices” to avoid environmental and other damage.Because the investors will “systematically execute [the project] to honour the contract and for long-term profit, it is not necessary to form a commission”, the minister said.Rather than put the proposal to a vote, Pyithu Hluttaw Speaker Thura U Shwe Mann asked three times if there were any representatives who objected to approving it and none responded, including the 25pc from the military, ensuring its passage through the hluttaw.

"367",367,"Bilateral relations: then and now",2012-11-19,"Sanctions to sucess","The visit of President Barack Obama to Yangon is obviously a major event in Myanmar-United States relations.          Despite the fact that the United States Congress has yet to repeal various sanction legislation on Myanmar, the visit is like a seal of approval on the government of President Thein Sein, at least for those who believe “the West is the Best”.In addition to messing up Yangon traffic for a few hours, the visit will also give the US President some good pictures for his eventual top-selling memoirs.His predecessor, George W. Bush, though he used to talk about Myanmar as a big problem, actually failed to mention the country in his memoirs. George W. Bush’s timing was bad. If only the government of Myanmar had held the national elections in 2006, rather than 2010, it would be Mr Bush who might have had the photo opportunities.From the point of view of President Obama’s diary secretary, dropping in on Myanmar while in the neighbourhood, while seeing top US Southeast Asian ally Thailand, and attending the East Asia summit in Cambodia, makes sense.It saves travel time and checks off three obligations with one long haul trip, thus saving the strapped American tax payer a bit of lolly. It is also a chance to remind China that the United States under Obama is taking a stand for its Asian interests which, of course, it would like to expand in Myanmar. It might even encourage some American trade and investment in Myanmar so that the United States can make some money, something it does not have much of, relatively speaking, these days.The last big day to mark on our calendars for American presidents meeting Myanmar heads of government was the 1966 State Visit by Myanmar Socialist Programme Party Chairman U Ne Win to Washington, D. C. Then President Lyndon Johnson was hunkering down in the White House in the midst of America’s losing war in Vietnam and looking to prove to a sceptical world that the United States defended the rights of small states to remain independent.Little came from the visit, but President Johnson subsequently described his private and off-the-record conversations with Chairman Ne Win as one of his most stimulating meetings with a foreign head of state during his time in the White House.After the visit, the American press was impressed, almost to the point of disbelief, that Chairman Ne Win did not ask for American aid. He asked for nothing but to be left alone. Informally, however, the United States proved to be cooperative with Myanmar, particularly in the provision of military training. When subsequently Myanmar’s relations with China deteriorated during the Cultural Revolution, the United States had the good sense to stay out of the conflict in order not to make a bad situation worse.President Harry Truman secretly authorised, not even telling his Secretary of State, the Central Intelligence Agency to arm and support, with Thailand and Taiwan, the KMT troops which fled across the border with Yunnan in 1949. His idea was that they would provide a diversion to Chinese forces engaged in the Korean War, at the other end of China. The KMT did little of that, but they posed problems for Myanmar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and gave rise to the drug trade, which is one of the continuing legacies of US-Myanmar relations.Even before Myanmar gained its independence, United States presidents gave thought to Myanmar from time to time. President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared to British Prime Minister Churchill during World War Two that he did not like the Burmese. His sweeping aspersion on a population approaching 20 million was based on a single encounter with then Myanmar Premier U Saw.U Saw had flown to London and Washington on the cusp of the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia in order to convince Prime Minister Churchill to promise dominion status to Myanmar in exchange for Burmese support for the British war effort. When Churchill said no deal, U Saw flew on to Washington and tried to bargain with US President Franklin Roosevelt.His offer was essentially, “You, Mr President, get Churchill to change his mind and promise me dominion status or independence after the war, and I will stop taxing the American military equipment you are shipping up the Burma Road via Yangon to your allies in China, the KMT government of Chiang Kai-shek.”President Roosevelt rejected the offer and U Saw flew off in time to get bombed on at Pearl Harbour before flying back to Yangon via Europe. However, he contacted the Japanese in Lisbon, Portugal, and thanks to American Naval Intelligence, spent the remainder of the war in a British prison in Uganda.American presidents before President Franklin D. Roosevelt thought little of Myanmar, if at all. Then part of the British Indian empire, if they thought about Myanmar, it was as part of the problem of British imperialism, not Myanmar as such. An exception, however, was President Herbert Hoover.The President who is best known for having had the bad luck to be in office at the time of the 1929 Wall Street crash and the commencement of the 1930s worldwide recession, which included the Saya San Rebellion as a side show, Herbert Hoover was a mining engineer before entering politics during World War I.He made millions of dollars over a 10 year period in London, amongst other things, developing the Namtu-Bawdwin Mines in the Shan states. Americans had long seen Myanmar as a fabled place of mineral resources from which to make money and it is doubtful that has changed. However, it would be churlish not to think that President Obama is visiting for loftier motives.In 2012, with President Obama entering his second and last four years in office, the reorientation of US foreign policy away from the Middle East and back to East and Southeast Asia is bound to be further advanced. Just as the United States appeared to ignore South and Southeast Asia during the Bush years, with the President concentrating on Iraq, Afghanistan and the larger Middle East, the Obama administration has tried to redevelop links with Asia. This is for good economic and strategic reasons.Economically, India, China and the countries of Southeast Asia are the most economically dynamic of any in the world today. With Europe economically moribund and the Middle East an area of increasing political instability, the best regions for the development of trade and investment are in Asia.Besides, much of America’s debt is held by Asian economies, especially China, and the future of that debt may spell the future of the United States.Strategically, the United States government has seen the Pacific Ocean as an American lake since the end of World War II. With the nominal demilitarisation of Japan, the United States faced no challengers from the Indian Ocean to San Francisco Bay.Now China is beginning to develop its sea power and strategic interests beyond its border. China has also been astute in utilising its financial and cultural power to win friends and gain influence in Southeast Asia while reminding Japan that it is not the only country with interests in Northeast Asia.States have long memories and long planning horizons and the will to power does not lapse with time. Though China today is largely militarily incapable of projecting power far from its shores, in time that can change, and the United States wants to forestall that possibility.Whether there is any reason to be so concerned is a question that is not asked in Washington or Beijing. Perhaps it should and save everyone a lot of grief, in addition to traffic jams.Meanwhile, Myanmar might as well go along for the ride, though beware of the destination. Ask for a seat near the exit.Robert H.

"368",368,"Obama continues his ‘Pivot to Asia’",2012-11-19,"In Depth","This week’s landmark visit by United States President Barack Obama will seek to consolidate the foreign policy shift that occurred during his first term in office, analysts said.          Mr Obama will travel to Cambodia and Thailand but it is his decision to become the first sitting president to visit Myanmar that has attracted most attention, coming barely 18 months after President U Thein Sein was handed the reins of Myanmar’s quasi-civilian government.“ASEAN is the linchpin of the US rebalance toward Asia and Myanmar is a newly emerging important player in ASEAN. For years, the US couldn’t fully engage ASEAN as a grouping because of its sanctions against Myanmar,” said Murray Hiebert, deputy director, senior fellow and chair for Southeast Asian Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.“The US rebalance toward Asia with ASEAN as centerpiece can be expected to continue with the re-election of President Obama,” Mr Hiebert added.But the first tentative steps in re-engaging with Myanmar took place in a March 2009 meeting between then-Minister of Foreign Affairs U Nyan Win and a mid-level member of the US State Department.Four months later, on July 23, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, which the US had previously refused to do because of its policy towards Myanmar.“Southeast Asia and ASEAN are critically important to our future,” Ms Clinton said at the time.It was a dramatic change in policy from the George W Bush administration, which not only paid little attention to ASEAN but also attempted to isolate Myanmar through economic sanctions and other restrictions.“The US has basically ignored Southeast Asia until the end of the Bush administration [and the] appointment of an ambassador to ASEAN. The US’s Myanmar policy shift is the most important positive result of all US policy issues in East Asia [and was] even mentioned in the Democratic Party platform for the convention,” said Professor David Steinberg, distinguished professor of Asian studies at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and author of multiple books on Myanmar.The encouragement of the reform process in Myanmar was mentioned among the top foreign policy achievements during President Obama’s first term in the 2012 Democratic Party platform at the Democratic National Convention, along with the toppling of regimes during the Arab Spring uprisings and recognition of newly independent South Sudan.“Our historic opening to Burma will continue to incentivise a democratic transition, a deeper engagement with the United States, and national reconciliation among Burma’s many different ethnic groups,“ the statement said.“And because human rights violations persist, we will continue to speak clearly about the additional steps that must be taken for the government of Burma to have a better relationship with the United States.” Prior to his visit, President Obama met representatives from prominent human rights groups at the White House to discuss the situation in Myanmar.A day after the trip was confirmed, Samantha Power, special assistant to the president and senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights at the National Security Council, wrote on the White House blog that the US was “clear-eyed about the challenges that Burma faces”.Ms Power detailed a trip by a US delegation in October that aimed to encourage further dialogue on remaining human rights challenges. The delegation “included experts on labour rights and economic development, rule of law and political reform, ethnic conflict and reconciliation, land-mine removal, and criminal justice,” and was led by Michael Posner, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour.One high-profile issue is communal violence in Rakhine State, where recent rioting left 89 dead, and 110,000 have been displaced since June.Despite the visits by high-ranking officials and consultations with rights groups, not all analysts feel that the US will take the lead on issues related to minority rights, particularly in relation to countries that share a border with Myanmar.Joshua Kurlantzick, a fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the US had an “important” role to play on ethnic and minority issues “but the US is not the major or critical player in Myanmar. Other countries like China, India, Singapore, and Thailand are far more important.”In regards to the recent unrest in Rakhine State, “the key countries here are Bangladesh, the Gulf states, China, India, and other regional countries, not the US”, Mr Kurlantzick said.Despite decades of oppressive rule, earlier discussion of investigating accusations of human rights abuses under the previous military regime has all but disappeared in the interests of bettering relations.“It is my hunch that if the US had pushed for a commission of inquiry on past crimes before it started to normalise relations the government would have shut down the reform process before it had really started,” said Mr Hiebert.The US has also lifted a number of the economic sanctions it put in place to punish the country and its former leaders, although US companies are still banned from doing business with a large number of individuals, who are also banned from entering the US.As Myanmar’s ties with the US have improved, President U Thein Sein has gone to great lengths to reassure China that Myanmar still values its relationship with it largest neighbour and source of foreign investment.During the years when many Western countries sanctioned Myanmar and discouraged companies from doing business there, China pumped billions of dollars of foreign direct investment into the country, mostly in large infrastructure projects, and became Myanmar’s most important trade partner.Dr Steinberg said he believes that Myanmar has handled this tricky diplomatic situation skillfully.“The Chinese took Hillary Clinton’s trip (and the Myitsone Dam decision before it) badly, and they may do the same on Obama’s trip, but I think the US recognises that China and Myanmar must remain friends and close. I think Burma/Myanmar’s neutralist policies since independence have been sound, and this new opening is part of that process,” Dr Steinberg said.While US foreign policy is expected to continue on a similar trajectory – unless Myanmar’s reform process falters – the individuals on the US side will almost certainly be different.The Obama administration’s most visible face in Asia, Ms Clinton, is expected to depart from her post, with US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice tipped as her likely successor.Since taking the secretary of state post in 2009, Ms Clinton has visited all 10 ASEAN nations and, after this week’s trip, will have visited six of the ASEAN members more than once.There are also questions surrounding Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, although no official announcement has been made that he will be stepping down.","/in-depth/3171-obama-continues-his-pivot-to-asia.html"
"369",369,"China: a hidden danger in the reform process",2012-11-19,"Opinion","United States President Barack Obama visits Myanmar today.          This milestone is one of many over the past year of reform for the once-pariah state also known as Burma. These reforms and the consequent improvement of US-Myanmar relations appear to be an unalloyed good.In the past year the reformist government of Present U Thein Sein has released many political prisoners, allowed progressively greater political participation by the democratic opposition and made significant progress towards ending ethnic insurgencies that have troubled the country for decades.As Myanmar has reformed, the US, which once imposed a harsh sanctions regime, has sought to encourage and support the process. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Myanmar in December 2011.The US has lifted or suspended most of its economic sanctions. This, in turn, paves the way for aid, investment and advice from the US, its allies, and multilateral financial institutions. For US and Western firms Myanmar holds the promise of rapid-growth investment opportunities in an underserved market of 60 million people.But behind these positive developments lurks a danger: the sensitivity and potential reaction of China, Myanmar’s neighbour to the north, to increased US involvement.For China, the relationship with Myanmar has economic and strategic value. Myanmar is a market for Chinese goods. Myanmar also supplies or will supply China with primary products ranging from agricultural and fisheries to minerals and natural gas.China is also deeply involved in infrastructure construction in Myanmar, including several hydropower projects and a special economic zone in Kyaukpyu in Rakhine State. China is also building gas and oil pipelines and a transportation corridor across Myanmar from Kyaukpyu to Ruili, on the China border.The natural gas will come from fields off Myanmar’s west coast but the oil will be brought from Africa and the Middle East. The pipeline allows China to bypass the Strait of Malacca, a potential choke-point subject to control by the US Navy.Chinese descriptions of China-Myanmar relations invariably stress harmony between the two peoples from time immemorial. These often use the Burmese word “Pauk Paw” for the special fraternal nature of the relationship. This narrative glosses over historical conflicts, the last of which ended only in the mid-1980s when China shifted from supporting revolution to encouraging trade.China’s vision of “Pauk Paw” harmony also papers over the anti-Chinese sentiment prevalent in Myanmar. The perception in Myanmar is that Chinese companies use bribes and the Chinese government’s support for Myanmar at the United Nations to obtain preferential concessions for resource and infrastructure projects. This popular view holds that the Myanmar military, the Tatmadaw, has been selling out the nation to the Chinese. As long as the Tatmadaw was exercising dictatorial authority, the model that Chinese companies brought to Myanmar worked, as it does in China. In China the key to any project is having good government connections.There is no need to develop relations with affected locals, civil society or other stakeholders. When the political situation in Myanmar changed and the new civilianised government began to make reforms that reflected popular will, Chinese projects, not having developed support among non-government stakeholders, were vulnerable.In fact, despite precursors, the reform period in Myanmar can be dated from the September 30, 2011 presidential decision to suspend work on the main dam (of seven) in the Chinese-backed Myitsone Hydropower Project.Despite public outcry against the Myitsone project over its perceived negative impact on the natural environment and cultural heritage, less than a month before the suspension Myanmar’s Minister for Electric Power 1, U Zaw Min, told the press: “We will not back down just because environmental groups are against it.”He may have actually been correct, as the suspension appears to have had more to do with the perception of the project as Chinese exploitation. In a country suffering from chronic power shortages, 90 percent of the electricity produced was to be sold to China.More recently protests against the expansion of a Chinese-operated copper mine at Letpadaung in central Myanmar have drawn national and international attention. The Chinese pipeline project has been criticised by local and exile non-government organisations over land use, compensation and environmental problems.International NGOs have criticised it for construction in conflict zones, and members of the democratic opposition have privately called the project a violation of Myanmar’s national sovereignty.Many Chinese policy intellectuals see the improvement of US-Myanmar relations, the reform process in Myanmar, and problems for Chinese projects there as part of a US-directed plot to contain China.Yuan Peng of the American Research Centre at the China Institute of Contemporary International Affairs (CICIR) wrote in the July 31 overseas edition of the People’s Daily that “the US will avail itself of various non-military means to delay or hinder China’s progressive rise”.Yuan said these include “[s]trengthening alliances and enhancing partnerships while undermining China’s relationships with the North Korea, Pakistan and Myanmar”. The Obama administration’s “Pivot to Asia” has only fed this dominant and paranoid strain in Chinese thought.Why should Chinese anxiety about improvement in US-Myanmar relations matter? It might be tempting to see problems that Chinese projects have as just desserts for not taking account of a broad range of stakeholder interests.But Myanmar and China share a long border and, despite a slowdown in its growth, China is still an economic powerhouse. Its influence in Myanmar will continue to be large. Support from China and Chinese companies for Myanmar’s reforms and development will help quicken and deepen their implementation.Opposition could contribute to their stagnation.What should President Obama do on his visit to Myanmar to assuage Chinese anxiety? First, he should make clear that China-US-Myanmar relations are not a zero-sum game in which any gain for the US is a loss for China. Myanmar needs support from the US, China, ASEAN and its other neighbours to successfully implement sustainable and equitable reforms.Second, President Obama should frame US support for reform in terms that the Chinese use: stability and “win-win” outcomes. Reform in Myanmar will make the country more stable and a more stable Myanmar will better protect China’s long-term interests by pushing Chinese investors to reach out to stakeholders.Chinese support for reform in Myanmar will result in a “win-win-win” situation which benefits Myanmar, the US and China.Josh Gordon is a PhD candidate in anthropology at Yale University and his dissertation research is on Chinese identity in the China-Myanmar borderlands.

"370",370,"Poverty, conflict to blame for opium production rise: UN",2012-11-05,"National News","Opium cultivation in Myanmar is expected to increase in 2012 on last year because of food shortages, poverty and armed conflict, a United Nations official said last week.          “Opium poppy growing increases when there is weakness in the country’s security, and law and order,” Mr Jason Eligh, regional representative of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC), said in Nay Pyi Taw on October 31.UNODC country manager Mr Jason Eligh said eradication alone is not an effective means of reducing opium poppy cultivation.“We must remember why farmers grow poppy. In most cases it is because they need cash to buy food to feed their families. Growing opium poppy provides much needed food security for many of them,” a UNODC statement quoted Mr Eligh as saying.“In areas of conflict and instability like Shan and Kachin states with poor access to markets, there are few employment alternatives to poppy. A sustainable long-term solution to poppy can only come through significant investment in peace, the rule of law and alternative development.”According to the South-East Asia Opium Survey 2012, in 2011 the country had 43,600 hectares given over to opium growing and 256,000 opium farmers. The total production of raw opium was 610 tonnes, giving a yield of 14 kilograms a hectare for a total value of US$330 million.Those numbers have grown in 2012 to 51,000 hectares of opium poppy and 300,000 cultivators, with a total production of 690 tonnes. The yield per hectare is slightly lower, at 13.5kg, but the value has risen to $420 million, said Mr Eligh.Overall, opium cultivation in Southeast Asia has doubled over the past six years, UNODC says.In 2011, there were 39,000 hectares of opium fields in Shan State, representing 90 percent of all poppy cultivation in Myanmar. That proportion has fallen to 82pc in 2012, though the cultivation area has increased to 46,000 hectares.The 2012 figures are estimated by combining the results of satellite and field surveys. Poppies grow mostly in the dry season, from September to December.Of the 690 tonnes of opium produced, most is destined for the Chinese market, with the rest distributed throughout the world via other Asian countries. Local consumption makes up a relatively small amount, Mr Eligh said.“We can say there are few local consumers in Myanmar because only 75,000 people are injecting drug users,” said Major General Kyaw Kyaw Tun, the deputy minister for home affairs.Mr Eligh said more should be done to provide farmers with food, help them shift to substitution crops and develop infrastructure that would facilitate trade in agricultural products. Alternative careers should be provided through the establishment of vocational schools, he said.“We must try to fill their needs because they will grow poppies if they have no food and no income,” he said. “The daily income from a paddy field is just K1000 to K1500. But farmers can make K5000 a day with poppies.”Conflict zones have also become larger opium-producing areas because of the breakdown of the rule of law. “Poppy cultivation in Kachin State was limited in the past, but is now increasing. That shows the lack of security,” he said.The anti-drug taskforce destroyed more than 7000 hectares of opium poppy fields in 2010-11, and more than 23,700 hectares in 2011-12, said Maj Gen Kyaw Kyaw Tun.Translated by Thiri Min Htun","/national-news/2885-poverty-conflict-to-blame-for-opium-production-rise-un.html"

The company, a subsidiary of Chinese state-owned arms manufacturer Norinco, has come under fire in recent months over its investment in the Monywa copper mine.“We will see the future consequences and will judge upon the case. There is too much insult [to] the company’s dignity already. So I have the right to take legal action if more insult to company,” managing director Mr Geng Yi said at a press conference in Yangon on October 14.The press conference was held to respond to an October 9 report by Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) that a pagoda near the mine had been destroyed with explosives. The video report showed an explosion at the mine, which the broadcaster said was the pagoda being destroyed.Mr Geng said the report was false and could create misunderstandings between the company and religious groups.“If you hear something bad about the company, come and ask to make it sure before you release. We are welcome for your question. In this case, we face the problem with local religious organisation who thinks we destroyed the heritage of Ledi Sayadaw,” Mr Geng said.At the press conference, he used a projector to show a photo of the pagoda taken on October 13.“Our company is legal and our aim is to get win-win situation in the long run. We have never aimed to destroy the traditional or religious culture of Myanmar. We respect the country’s religion and culture,” Mr Geng said, adding that the company had submitted a report about the incident to the Sagaing Region government.U Maung Maung Tint, project director of military-owned Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL), Wanbao’s partner in the project, said incorrect news reports were “very dangerous”.“That news creates conflict with the whole country … people will think we are so rude after combining with Chinese. We never did it. We are Buddhist,” he said.U Myint Aung, managing director at Myanmar Wanbao and project manager of UMEHL, said the site in the DVB footage where the explosion occurred was about 500 metres from the pagoda.The DVB report quoted a resident in one of the villages near the mine, Ko Aung Zaw Oo, as saying that the pagoda and a small monastery had been destroyed by the company.One DVB reporter, who asked not to be named, said his colleague had based the story on what the villager had told him. “I admit that the first two scenes [in the video report] can mislead people. The first one is the pagoda and the second is a mine detonation on the hills,” he said.DVB has since apologised for the report.","/national-news/2603-chinese-mining-firm-threatens-legal-action.html"
"372",372,"Huawei’s Myanmar plans in the spotlight after US report aired",2012-10-15,"Business","A scathing US congressional report issued on October 8 has added an unexpected wrinkle to Myanmar’s already chaotic telecoms race.          The 52-page report, published by the Intelligence Committee of America’s House of Representatives, states that China-based Huawei Technologies Ltd and ZTE Corp pose a credible security threat given both companies’ lack of transparency and possible ties to China’s Communist Party.The report urged US consumers to look elsewhere to meet their telecoms needs.“Private sector entities in the United States are strongly encouraged to consider the long-term security risks associated with doing business with either ZTE or Huawei,” the report said.“Based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems.”Huawei, the world’s second largest provider of telecommunications gear and mobile phones, has emerged as one of the most aggressive competitors vying for a piece of Myanmar’s critically underdeveloped and highly coveted telecoms sector.For every 100 people in Myanmar only 1.26 has access to a fixed telephone line, and 0.03 has broadband internet access, according to the Asian Development Bank. Estimates of mobile phone penetration are under 4 percent.Days after the report’s release the ripple effect was being felt at Huawei’s operations outside the US. The Canadian government gave strong signals on October 9 that it would exclude Huawei from helping to construct a planned secure Canadian telecoms network, citing security concerns.Sir Malcolm Rifkind of UK’s parliament’s intelligence and security committee confirmed on October 10 that the committee will be looking into Huawei’s dealings with BT Group PLC. They will deliver a report of their own findings to Prime Minister David Cameron in December.Meanwhile, members of Myanmar’s Ministry of the Communications, Posts and Telegraphs refused to comment due to the sensitivity of the matter.Huawei representatives remained confident that the company’s US troubles would not damage their attempts to win one of Myanmar’s two lucrative telecoms operating licenses that could be made available as soon as early 2013.Huawei operates a total of five offices in Myanmar. The two main offices are located in Yangon and Nay Pyi Daw, while the remaining three are smaller branch offices. The company has a workforce of 260 employees in Myanmar, 70pc of whom are Myanmar nationals.“I think in Myanmar, no, no impact,” said Chen Xiao Yong, the director of the public relations department for Huawei working in Yangon. He added that a “coloured opinion” of China in the US could be at least partially responsible for the allegations in the report, a feeling shared by many in the Chinese media.“Huawei is committed to being a long-term investor in Myanmar, providing innovative products and service for our Myanmar people, and to being a responsible investor, tax payer and corporate citizen,” Mr Xiao Yong said in a post interview email.Though Huawei has had a presence in Myanmar since 2003 the company has lacked the name recognition of its competitors, especially in the booming smart-phone sector. Their profile was bolstered on September 20 when President U Thein Sein visited company headquarters in Shenzhen during his trip to China.U Thein Sein took part in a video conference with members of the Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a Myanmar embassy and Myanmar students studying in China using Huawei technology. He toured company facilities alongside Huwaei’s secretive founder and president Ren Zhengfei before meeting with Huawei’s Southeast Asia president Yang Shu and Yangon managing director Ren Geng.The visit, which the company has taken to marketing through press releases, photo brochures and visits to local media outlets, runs directly against Mr Xiao Yong’s insistence that the company is uninterested and divorced from politics in its pursuit of large-scale business in Myanmar.In 2009, two years after launching a CDMA 450MHz network in Myanmar, the company entered into an agreement with Elite Tech, an offshoot of the Htoo Group of Companies run by billionaire tycoon U Tay Za.Representatives for Huawei refused to comment on their agreement or relationship with the Htoo Group, Elite Tech or U Tay Za.U Tay Za and the Htoo Group were added to a US blacklist in October 2007. With Huawei already in business with one US blacklisted company and possibly facing the same fate itself, reluctance from the Myanmar government to allow them to expand would be understandable.Myanmar has made tremendous strides in building relations with the US in the past year. With President Barack Obama lifting lending sanctions last week, virtually all restrictions have now been eased. It seems unlikely that Myanmar would risk such an important infrastructure project on a company running afoul of an ally they are eager to please.Additionally experts have cited Myanmar’s desire to distance itself from China as one of key reasons for democratic reform and economic opening. Unimpeded by sanctions and geographically advantaged, China is Myanmar’s largest investor accounting for roughly 35pc of foreign direct investment. An operating license for Huawei may be seen as a step back towards Beijing.Even if the report does not bring action from the Myanmar government, terms like “spy” and “espionage” circulating through traditional and social media could be enough shake the already wavering consumer confidence that Myanmar customers have in Chinese businesses and products.“Local Burmese see Chinese companies as wealthy and interested in the natural resources of their country, but have little concern for governance, transparency or accountability. Rumours of corruptions associated with Chinese projects are widespread,” said Yun Sun a visiting fellow with the East Asian program at the Stimson Center, a non-profit research group in Washington, DC.","/business/2418-huawei-s-myanmar-plans-in-the-spotlight-after-us-report-aired.html"
"373",373,"Monywa investors court the press to refute allegations",2012-10-08,"National News","In the latest surprising development at the Monywa copper mine, officials from the Chinese and army-owned firms involved in the project have taken the rare step of holding a press conference to rebut the accusations of residents and activists.          The normally media-shy Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL) – whose officials have for years responded to requests for interviews by insisting the company does not speak to the press – invited journalists from eight major Myanmar media organisations to the mine site late last month. Journalists were also given a tour of the mine, which is normally off limits to outsiders.The step highlights the seriousness with which the project’s investors, which also include a subsidiary of Chinese weapons manufacturer Norinco, are taking the growing outcry and protests over alleged corruption, environmental damage and unfair land acquisitions at the mine.“Everything that is being said about the land [acquisitions], environmental [impacts] and [workers] insulting local people are just rumours,” U Maung Maung Tint, project director of Myanmar Wanbao Mining Copper Limited, said at a September 26 press conference.He said K5 billion compensation had already been paid to farmers for crops lost due to the expansion, while the company will pay K3 million a kilometre annually to the government in rent. No compensation was given for land acquired for the project, however.Company officials also responded to accusations that most of the workers at the mine would be Chinese.While he did not say what the composition of the workforce is at present, U Maung Maung Tint said after the US$1 billion Letpadaung expansion, which will enable the mine to produce about 100,000 tonnes of 99.9 percent pure copper a year, 78pc of workers will be Myanmar.“Chinese technicians will train Myanmar workers and they will leave after transferring knowledge to Myanmar workers,” he said.“We will fully employ only Myanmar citizens after they [are trained],” said Mr Geng Yi, managing director of Myanmar Wanbao Copper Mining Limited.U Ko Ko Myint, the head of environmental affairs at the mine, said the project’s environmental impact was audited by a foreign company every three years.“The water pollution in Yamar river that is near Kantkaw village is not because of the project but because of [artisanal miners]. They take raw acid from the leaching heap and process copper … this is unsafe for health. They keep pots of acid near their houses and wells,” he said.Project manager U Myint Aung from UMEHL said the government would get the most profit from the venture, followed by UMEHL and Wanbao Mining but did not give exact figures.The Monywa mine was previously owned and operated as a joint venture between Canadian firm Ivanhoe Mines and state-owned Mining Enterprise 1. Ivanhoe, since rebranded as Turquoise Hill, says on its website it received $103 million for its share in the mine but it is unclear what, if anything, the government received for the ME1 stake.As the negotiations and sale of went through before the transition to U Thein Sein’s government and establishment of parliament, no details about the transaction were ever publicly released for independent scrutiny. However, the sale did mention in a controversial auditor general’s office report into corruption in government ministries and state-owned enterprises that was assessed by the Pyithu Hluttaw Public Accounts Committee earlier this year.Just days after Myanmar Wanbao Copper Mining Company courted the media in Monywa, opponents of the mine, including residents of 26 villages in the area, held a press conference at Royal Rose Restaurant in Yangon. Also in attendance were members of the 88 Generation student group, environmental groups, lawyers and other politicians.“The government should conduct an urgent investigation into this issue in collaboration with environmental experts. They should cancel the project if it is going to have a disproportionate negative impact on the nearby residents and the environment,” said 88 Generation spokesperson Ko Tun Myint Aung.He said the group welcomes foreign investment that supports poverty alleviation but believes projects need to be transparent. “In this case, the government needs to listen to the voice of the public so that our country develops in a balanced way,” he said.","/national-news/2291-monywa-investors-court-the-press-to-refute-allegations.html"

The memorandum of agreement between IBPC and SCCCI was signed at the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry building in Lanmadaw township on September 19. The agreement was made during a visit by more than 100 Singaporean businesspeople, representing 38 sectors, and included a business matching session with Myanmar businesspeople at Strand Hotel on September 20.“More than 70 percent of SCCCI members are small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and Myanmar is welcoming investment in SMEs,” said Valery Lam, assistant manager of SCCCI’s commerce and industry development wing.“On this trip, we’ve just brought our businesspeople to meet and network with Myanmar entrepreneurs,” Mr Lam said.U Aik Htun, IBPC chairman and chairman of Shwe Taung Development Company, said: “The SCCCI delegation included representatives of companies in telecommunications, financial services, shipping, infrastructure, tourism and manufacturing. SCCCI would like to operate shipping, offices, hotel service, manufacturing, printing and infrastructure. We discussed cooperation in those businesses in Myanmar.”Myanmar has a long economic relationship with Singapore, especially in finance and shipping.Mr Teo Siong Seng, president of SCCCI and managing director of PIL shipping company, said: “My company has been working in Myanmar for 40 years. Our SCCCI delegation came to Myanmar to find local business partners.”“Myanmar’s new foreign investment law says companies can form 50-50 joint ventures, which is not relevant for technological investment but is a good first step to protect local SMEs,” he said.","/business/1759-ibpc-signs-mou-with-singapore-biz-body.html"

President U Thein Sein headed a joint government and business delegation to the five-day event, which concludes on September 25.Myanmar’s duties as the country of honour require that its official host programs as diverse as a roundtable talk between U Thein Sein and Chinese businesspeople, watch over a signing ceremony for Myanmar-China projects, hosting a national promotional conference and related summit on its gem and jewellery industries.U Tin Thwin, deputy director general of the Ministry of Commerce, said Myanmar is now making immense efforts to open up its domestic market to foreign businesses, and will use the 9th CAEXPO as platform to elaborate its new investment policies and relevant laws and regulations to investors and entrepreneurs.Myanmar will also bring more of its distinctive and competitive products to the CAEXPO for exhibition, where it has chartered a hall for its commodity pavilion to display jewellery and jade, agro-based products and foodstuffs, handicrafts and furniture, all of which are quite popular in the Chinese and global markets.Myanmar has also nominated Yadanabon cyber city, near Pyin Oo Lwin in Mandalay Region, as its City of Charm for the 9th CAEXPO to coincide with the expo’s theme “cooperation in science and technology”.The city is home to a number of government-funded projects, some of which are expecting to have investment from Chinese companies as well as other ASEAN member states.The CAEXPO Secretariat sent a working team to visit Myanmar in March, and signed with the Department of Trade, under the Ministry of Commerce, a Framework Agreement on Cooperation in Organising the 9th CAEXPO.","/business/1747-myanmar-the-country-of-honour-at-caexpo.html"
"376",376,"Investment in tourism looks set to reach new heights",2012-09-10,"Investment Myanmar","Political developments over the past year have opened the window on Myanmar as a new tourism market.          With many sanctions and travel boycotts lifted in recognition of reforms made, Myanmar is becoming a hot destination not only to travel and explore but also to invest in the industry.Many international airlines, hotel chains and hospitalities industries are closely watching Myanmar.“There are indeed a large number of hotel chains that see Myanmar as a very promising destination. Not only hotel chains, I think everybody sees this,” said Mr Frank Janmaat, general manager and country director of KMA Hotels Group.“Myanmar has, in the future at least, the same potential to offer as, for instance, Thailand, which attracts 40 times more visitors a year then we do. There is still a lot of work to do though, just think about the limited number of hotel rooms, infrastructure and the banking system just to name a few,” said Mr Frank Janmaat, general manager and country director of KMA Hotels Group.Ministry figures for 2011 show Myanmar has 731 licensed hotels with more than 25,002 rooms. Earlier this year the ministry announced plans to increase the number of hotel zones in Myanmar. So far 11 hotel zones have been created in popular tourist regions and more are likely to be established.And the government is keen to encourage both foreign and local investment in the hotel and tourism sector as it sees the potential for increased job opportunities without significant environmental damage.U Hpone Thant, a former secretary of the Union of Myanmar Travel Association said Myanmar is in a good position to make the right choices in terms of tourism growth.“It is a right time as the future looks good and hopefully not too far away. But investment must be … beneficial to the country,” he said.“In a single word, responsibility. The investor must have high ethical standards to develop tourism here. There must be non-discriminatory policies like wages for foreign recruits and local workers, equal opportunities regarding gender, ability and experience. And they must have an established ‘green’ outlook, not a hit and run investor just out for a quick dollar,” he said.The Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) has put historic state-owned buildings in central Yangon up for tender in a bid to ease the city’s shortage of hotel rooms.The commission has invited both local and foreign companies to bid on the properties for conversion into hotels on long-term leases.“These buildings will be leased for 30 years, with the possibility of two 15-year extensions under the investment law. According to our terms and conditions, the original structure and architectural features of the buildings will not be allowed to be changed,” said an MIC spokesperson.The spokesperson also added that more state-owned buildings would be put up and announced for tender at a later date.International hotel chains are already looking at Myanmar as the next tourism frontier.Thailand’s second-largest listed hotelier, Central Plaza Hotel is considering a joint-venture opportunity in Myanmar. Central Plaza runs 31 hotels and resorts in Thailand and other countries, of which 16 are under management contracts.The company has its business development team looking at opportunities in Myanmar for joint-ventures and the company aim to conclude their plans by the end of the year.Global hotel chains, including United States based Starwood Hotels & Resorts, which runs chains such as Westin, Sheraton and Le Meridien and Marriott International have also expressed interest in running hotels in Myanmar.Singapore currently tops foreign investment in Myanmar’s hotel sector, followed by Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Britain.Vietnam has also announced its intention to invest in Myanmar’s hotel and tourism sector. According to MIC, an unnamed Vietnamese company is starting to build a hotel at the site of a former ministry building near the Sedona Hotel on Kabar Aye Pagoda Road.A 15-member delegation of International Enterprise Singapore Business Department Trip to Myanmar, led by Group Director Southeast Asia Group Tan Soon Kin, held discussions with officials of Myanmar’s Ministry of Hotels and Tourism in the second week of May.However, there are still issues to overcome in order to turn interest into actual investment.Daw May Myat Mon Win, Assistant General Manager for marketing and operations of Chatrium Hotel in Yangon, said more favourable rules and regulations are needed to encourage more international investors to Myanmar.“International hotel chains interested in investing in Myanmar is a positive sign for the development of Myanmar tourism. Their interest in Myanmar upgrades the image of our country’s tourism business too.“But more importantly, the government should encourage these international investors with favourable tax, investment law and policies,” Daw May Myat Mon Win said.Mr Frank Janmaat highlighted the uncertainty concerning the as yet unfinished FDI law as a sticking point for investors who are looking at how best to enter the market.“I understand that the 100 percent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is still not approved. I understand the problems with it. If there are tax exemptions for foreign companies, there should be tax exemptions for local businesses as well. The FDI law should not create unfair competition.“On the other side, Myanmar has been closed for such a long time from the rest of the world that there are large differences in the way locals and foreigners are conducting business. The ability to work together will be challenging. Not allowing 100 pc FDI will probably slow down the economic development of the country. In addition we need to see how much capital is still available within the country. Not allowing 100 pc FDI will limit growth just because of insufficient funds,” he said.He also said that other issues will affect how FDI will come in, including adequate infrastructure and maintaining safeguards for maintaining development.“Compared with most other countries in the world the telephone and internet systems are inadequate according to 2012 standards. Facilities like international roaming and a fast and reliable internet connection are necessary for the economic development of the country,” he said.“I think however that not all sectors should be open for foreign investment but should be kept under [semi] government control, like public facilities and telecommunication systems,” he said.However, anticipation for real growth in the sector is in full swing, with a number of international airlines actively ramping up their presence in the country.More international airlines have announced plans to begin flights to Myanmar, including carriers from Europe and East Asia.The first international airline set to fly to Yangon is South Korea’s Korean Airlines. It will start from September 13 between Yangon and Seoul every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.Some of the new international airlines flying into Myanmar from October are Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, Chinese Taipei’s EVA, Japan’s All Nippon Airways (ANA), and Qatar Airways.Meanwhile, existing international operators are eyeing flights to Nay Pyi Taw, Bagan and Mandalay, according to the respective airlines. AirAsia will launch their new Mandalay service from October.In addition, German leisure carrier Condor – flying from Frankfurt to Yangon, Bangladesh’s Biman Airlines, Srilanka Airlines, Pakistan Airlines and a flight between Yangon and Philippine’s capital Manila are also planned to launch before the end of the year.The government is also tapping investment interest in the airline industry.The Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) has invited local and foreign investors to participate in a planned upgrade of Yangon International Airport and some other domestic airports, including Heho, Nyaung U, Tachileik, Myitkyina, Putao, Dawei, Myeik and Kawthoung.In late June, the DCA called for expressions of interest from local and foreign investors to restart the Hanthawaddy International Airport project, located on a 9000-acre (3642-hectare) site about 77 kilometres (48 miles) north of Yangon near Bago.It was first slated for development in the early 1990s. Work began in March 1994 but ceased in October 2003.“Now the [travel] market is strong and we are unable to meet market demand. We also need to offer better quality services for visitors. That’s why we are inviting private sector participation in the Hanthawaddy International Airport project and other international as well as domestic airports,” said U Tin Naing Tun, director general of the DCA, a Ministry of Transport body in late June.DCA hopes to have construction work begin in June 2013 for a December 2016 completion date. The airport will be capable of handling up to 10 million passengers a year, well above Yangon International Airport’s capacity of 2.7 million.","/special-features/150-investment-myanmar/2910-investment-in-tourism-looks-set-to-reach-new-heights.html"
"377",377,"Easing of sanctions offers mixed encouragement for investors ",2012-09-10,"Investment Myanmar","As Myanmar engages in a series of political and economic reforms, the West has rewarded these changes by easing sanctions and promoting economic engagement with the Southeast Asian nation.          But while the rolling back of sanctions against Myanmar by the West has been warmly welcomed as a symbolic gesture of support for President U Thein Sein’s reformist government, experts say this policy progress has done little to stir up a “tsunami” of investment.Although the easing of Western sanctions will help boost investor confidence in Myanmar, it’s going to take a lot more than that to attract significant new investment to Myanmar, said Jared Bissinger, a PhD candidate at Australia’s Macquarie University studying Myanmar’s economy.“It’s not the tsunami everyone thinks it is – many companies are coming to look but not all are slapping cash on the table. It takes years to improve a business climate and that will be the same case in Myanmar,” Mr Bissinger said.The European Union (EU), Canada, Australia and most recently the United States (US) have all taken steps to ease various sanctions against Myanmar, and delegations of visiting foreign firms have been scoping out investment opportunities in recent months.“We’ve essentially moved from broad to targeted sanctions,” US embassy deputy head of mission Eleanor Nagy told The Myanmar Times on the same day the US announced easing certain sanctions, explaining the US had retained its blacklist against certain individuals and companies thought to have close links to the former military regime.The move to allow new investment and financial services is a demonstration of support for President U Thein Sein’s government and will encourage continued progress toward democracy, Ms Nagy said.During a visit to Yangon in June, Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr announced all remaining travel and financial sanctions would be lifted and Australia would take steps to re-engage with Myanmar, a firm sign of encouragement to Australian firms.Australia’s move to lift sanctions would encourage investment from domestic firms and assist in normalizing trade relations, said Tim Harcourt, from the Australian School of Business and former chief economist at Austrade, the Australian government’s trade and investment arm.“The link between lifting economic sanctions and seeing actual economic progress is lengthy and complicated,” Mr Harcourt said.“Lifting sanctions is necessary but not sufficient … the economic evidence shows that there is a lag between lifting the legal sanction and when companies are actually brave enough to stick their toe in,” Mr Harcourt said.Punitive sanctions normally affected investment and not trade, Mr Harcourt said, adding “whatever the Burmese government could not obtain from Western countries, they could substitute them with Chinese products and services. Other products and services were supplied via ASEAN countries, which had also chosen not to impose any sanctions on Myanmar.”The move by the Australian government to wipe off its blacklist was mainly symbolic yet went a long way to improve investor perceptions and confidence in doing business with Myanmar, he said.There has been much debate over how effective Western punitive sanctions have been in influencing political change in Myanmar, with many experts coming to the conclusion that sanctions were unsuccessful and mainly hindered the socio-economic development of the impoverished Southeast Asian nation.One Yangon-based analyst said implementation of punitive sanctions by Western countries had been ineffective in encouraging reform by the former military junta.“The [Western] sanctions were not successful in meeting the original goals. For example, these sanctions and international pressure did not help to release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from her house arrest which covered most of her years in Yangon,” the analyst said.“The regime did not feel threatened to open up and speed up reforms. It has done this at its own pace and on its own terms.”The analyst said Western sanctions had affected the lives of ordinary Burmese instead of pressuring the government, adding “the lack of effectiveness and seriousness of Western countries in implementing the sanctions had contributed to the suffering of ordinary Burmese.”For determined foreign investors, sanctions are a mere formality and not a major deterrent, said Alessio Polastri, managing partner of Yangon-based law firm P&A Asia.“One of the most popular questions I hear is ‘how can I avoid sanctions?’ – not ‘tell me about the sanctions and can I do my business or not,’” Mr Polastri said.“If people already want to come here, they don’t care about sanctions, they just want to avoid them,” he said.Mr Bissinger said the high cost of operating in Myanmar was a greater deterrent to foreign investment than sanctions, as many firms put profits before politics.“Sanctions kept some countries from investing but I don’t think they’re the biggest reason why companies didn’t invest in Myanmar,” Mr Bissinger said.He said the high cost of doing business and the country’s formerly unstable political environment previously made it an unattractive alternative to investors.“Companies are coming in now because they see a change in the economic environment, and see the potential of investing in Myanmar,” Mr Bissinger said.Some are questioning whether the temporary suspension of sanctions by the European Union and the United States is actually deterring the Western investment the Burmese government is desperate to attract.Director of private equity firm E&O Capital Management, Chris Oram, said the EU’s decision to suspend sanctions for one year is deterring larger European investors from that region.“The biggest problem for European countries is the EU itself because the bureaucrats came up with a half-arsed proposal where they suspended sanctions for only one year,” Mr Oram said.“So if you’re coming in as a service company that doesn’t really matter but if you’re thinking of investing US$20 million with the potential of those sanctions being reimposed in six months then you’re more likely going to wait and see, rather than to invest now.”“So that’s what I think is the biggest hurdle to attracting European investors to Myanmar and I hope that in 12 months the EU will completely remove sanctions,” he said.However, the British Embassy Rangoon’s newly appointed commercial counsellor Hazel Hector said the UK companies she’d spoken to had not indicated the temporarily suspension of sanctions were deterring investment in Myanmar.“This doesn’t seem to be a major concern. Companies understand the removal of sanctions is a staged process and everyone seems very positive about the way things are moving forwards,” Ms Hector said.She said most new British companies looking to enter Myanmar were interested in long-term investment.“The suspension of sanctions is not deterring British companies from looking and showing interest in the market,” Ms Hector said.An American investor agreed that the uncertainly surrounding Western sanctions could impact on investment in the under-developed country.“I think there might be some hesitation, especially by large multinational corporations, regarding how much investment they want to do in Myanmar,” the source said.“However, I think most large investors will be hedging that the sanctions will be fully lifted and moved from that suspended state that they’re in now.”On July 12 the US Treasury Department announced the issuance of two general licences waiving investment and financial sanctions, two of the most important sanctions inhibiting US economic engagement with Myanmar. However, the import ban on Myanmar-manufactured products remains in place and was recently extended a further three years, no doubt a blow for Myanmar’s struggling garment industry.“Garments, a labour-intensive industry providing employment to thousands of Myanmar workers, represented over 80 pc in value of exports in the years running up to their banning in 2003 under the BFDA,” said Derek Tonkin, former British ambassador to Thailand and Vietnam and chairman of non-profit organisation Network Myanmar.He said the import ban did little to affect the Myanmar government receiving revenue from the lucrative gemstone industry which rights groups claim funds helps fund its military operations.The US government has a web of overlapping sanctions that are subject to differing restrictions, waiver provisions, expiration conditions, and reporting requirements, meaning there is still a long way to go before a clear path is laid for American investors.","/special-features/150-investment-myanmar/2904-easing-of-sanctions-offers-mixed-encouragement-for-investors.html"
"378",378,"Investors choice of local partner crucial",2012-09-10,"Investment Myanmar","Entering into a joint venture partnership in Myanmar can provide foreign investors with essential market knowledge and local assets and give local investors a shot in the arm with new capital, technology and markets.          But legal experts warn such a partnership can come with a lot of risk and as Myanmar opens up to foreign investment, an issue facing incoming firms is whether to enter into a joint venture with a local Myanmar partner or to start up shop on their own.In the more lucrative sectors, including oil and gas and mining, going it alone simply isn’t an option. While 100 percent foreign ownership is permitted in some industries, Myanmar law stipulates certain sectors are only accessible through a joint venture profit-sharing agreement with a local company and the relevant government body.Foreign investors will need to choose their local partner wisely, to ensure they can value add to the joint venture and to mitigate any chance of dispute, given Myanmar’s untested legal system and lack of precedents, legal experts say.Disputes with joint venture partners over money, profit-sharing arrangements, intellectual property, reputation, arbitration and the ability of Myanmar’s legal system to enforce laws protecting their investments are some key concerns foreign investors need to consider before committing to a partnership.But despite the obvious risks, creating a joint venture can be beneficial to both the foreign firm and the local partner, said Alessio Polastri, managing partner of Yangon-based law firm P & A Asia, as local partners can contribute essential assets, such as land and property, which foreign individuals and firms are not permitted to own under Myanmar law, as well as vital market knowledge on how to navigate the country’s complex economic and bureaucratic environment.“Sharing profits also mean sharing risks and having assets which is sometimes priceless in emerging markets,” Mr Polastri said.“Firms wanting to do business in Myanmar could benefit from a local partner who knows how to navigate the complexities of Southeast Asia’s final frontier market,” he said.Foreign firms should not underestimate the value their local partners can bring to the joint venture partnership he said, adding foreign investors needed to consider all the risks involved and do their homework before deciding to commit, as taking the time to find the right local partner will be integral to the success of their business.And many local companies are jostling for the opportunity to engage in a joint venture partnership with foreign firms, which they view as bearers of new and improved technology and fresh capital, according to president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Parami Energy Group of Companies, U Ken Tun.“New technology, capability and reputation are the three most important things a foreign partner can bring,” U Ken Tun said. “There are many Myanmar firms keen to learn how to improve their business standards and practices and they can do this through engagement with a reputable foreign partner.”“I say to foreign firms, come in and identify an opportunity then find a person who shares the same vision,” U Ken Tun said. “I hope businessmen who really want to improve this country can take part in this movement.”Parami recently signed a profit-sharing joint venture agreement with Indian firm Jubilant Energy and MOGE (the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise) to explore for onshore oil and gas in the PSC-I block in Ayeyarwaddy Region in Southern Myanmar. Parami and Jubilant won the tender for the block during an auction in July last year and Parami makes no secret of its desire to expand further into the lucrative oil and gas sector and ultimately operate its own block.But for now, the junior oil and gas firm said it is content to be the minority shareholder in the joint venture partnership with Jubilant, while benefiting from the established Indian operator’s knowledge and expertise.In addition to bringing in better business techniques and helping promote responsible investment, foreign firms can provide the cash required to turn many local investors’ pipe-dreams into reality, as access to capital is the greatest barrier inhibiting local business, said Chris Oram, director of Yangon-based private equity firm E&O Capital Management.“There is a desire from many Myanmar business people who don’t have sufficient capital or access to capital and who don’t want to go into an equity partnership locally, so they are looking to raise capital from international investors,” Mr Oram said.“Some are looking for equity, some are looking for debt, some are looking for a combination as obviously there’s no local debt market because the interest rate is prohibitive,” he said.“There’s a lot of old money that has been sitting still for a long time and that’s emerging, but they don’t necessarily have enough to fund an entire project on their own.”Not all local businessmen are sold on the concept of joint venturing with foreign firms but one thing is clear – local constraints over access to capital frames a joint venture as a lifeline to access fresh project funding.According to the most recent drafts of Myanmar’s foreign direct investment amendment bill, foreign investors seeking to enter certain parts of the Myanmar market may have the option of creating a company with 100 pc foreign ownership but certain sectors are only accessible through joint venture partnerships.Access to the lucrative oil and gas industry is limited to a profit sharing joint venture arrangement with the local company owning the exploration concession and a profit-sharing agreement with the government body MOGE.It’s a similar case for the mining sector where concessions for Myanmar’s rich mineral resource reserves are controlled by the Ministry of Mines and the best spots have been awarded to private local companies, leaving foreign mining firms with the option of approaching local firms for joint venture arrangements or green-fielding at their own expense in the hope of finding a previously undiscovered deposit and negotiating the exclusive mining rights with the Ministry, Ministry officials told investors at a conference in June.Although many opportunities have been identified, grey areas surrounding security of their investment could deter many foreign firms from investing in Myanmar and the protection of intellectual property is one area which should be of key concern to those in the extractive, manufacturing and telecommunications industries, warns Steven Dickinson, an American lawyer with Hong Kong-based law firm Harris & Moure and who has extensive experience in the Chinese business scene.“This is what we found in China – if your local partner is in the same industry they will have a natural desire to be competitive,” Mr Dickinson told The Myanmar Times at an investment summit in Yangon in June.He said many of his clients, predominantly Western investors, were concerned over how to protect their intellectual property and the ability of Myanmar’s legal system to enforce laws protecting their investments.“There’s always a lot of competition in the manufacturing industry and while foreign investors desperately want to come here, (Myanmar) it’s not attractive right now,” Mr Dickinson said.Myanmar’s lack of clear legal structure and untested foreign investment law remain key sticking points for foreign investors. Joint ventures can go wrong.One Yangon-based business consultant, who requested not to be identified, warned eager foreign investors to be prudent when considering entering into a joint-venture arrangement with Myanmar companies and avoid doing business with big tycoons and individuals on targeted sanctions list.During the decades of military rule, access to Myanmar’s business circuit was controlled by a small, elitist circle of business tycoons with have close ties to Myanmar’s former military regime, which still control the majority of private enterprise.And certain individuals and companies remain on the various targeted sanctions lists maintained by Western countries for their close links to the former military regime, and foreign investors need to consider the potential legal and reputational risks of dealing with these companies or persons.The Yangon British Embassy’s business handbook states “a number of the bigger companies have been on the EU sanctions list for many years – and remain on a suspended list. This may pose long-term risks and/or reputational risks for your company.”And to make matters more confusing for foreign investors, Western nations have each taken different approaches to maintaining these blacklists while they cautiously encourage the Myanmar government for its series of political and economic reforms, with the European Union (EU) opting for a one year suspension, the Australian government by abolishing its list completely, while the US Treasury Department has maintained its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, which includes high profile individuals such as Myanmar’s President Thein Sein.Finding a Myanmar firm or individual not linked to the former regime and with sound international experience in dealing with companies outside of Myanmar is quite a challenge, say some foreign investors, pointing out some of Myanmar’s larger firms are well-versed when it comes to operating in ASEAN countries, which never imposed any form of sanctions, yet have no experience in Western markets.Some foreign firms prefer to deal with well-known local tycoons, to circumvent the bureaucratic challenges central to doing business in Myanmar, Mr Polastri said, adding the profile of such individuals is very appealing to big businesses because they are financially sound, with a deep knowledge of the local market and with abundant high-value assets.“However Myanmar is home to a number of other raising businessmen who are also financially sound and who are not lacking with experience of their own,” he says.“These raising businessmen may not be as rich or as experienced but they are still valuable candidates who can, and should be considered as potential local partners.  Not surprisingly, they are also looking for foreign partners to help propel their businesses to the international level and to develop continuous working relationships with.”But he says it’s ultimately up to the foreign firm to make the call and choose their business bedfellow.","/special-features/150-investment-myanmar/2902-investors-choice-of-local-partner-crucial.html"
"379",379,"Banking sector comes under spotlight",2012-09-10,"Investment Myanmar","As Myanmar takes steps to overhaul its banking sector and engage in a range of industry reforms, the role of foreign investment has come under the spotlight.          A strong local banking sector is essential in developing the private sector and maintaining sustainable economic growth, experts have said, with Myanmar’s finance industry needing revitalisation if it is to support an influx of foreign and local investment.Foreign banks could provide a “critical bridge” between Myanmar firms and the rest of the world, said Dr Sean Turnell, an Australian economist who has written extensively about Myanmar’s banking sector, adding foreign banks would open up more opportunities for exporters, importers and others.“Foreign banks would directly introduce modern technologies and methods, but they would also stimulate some of the better domestic players to lift their game,” Dr Turnell said, adding Myanmar’s local banking system needed extensive reform and revitalisation, particularly in rural areas.Domestic banks have an important role to play in Myanmar’s future development, Dr Turnell added. “Domestic institutions need to be the mobilisers, aggregators and allocators of Myanmar’s financial resources.”But any significant development in the sector hinges on the outcome of the country’s new foreign direct investment (FDI) and banking sector laws and whether Myanmar’s banking sector will remain off-limits to foreign investment.There has been much debate among industry circles over what vehicle will be chosen by the government to facilitate foreign investment in the country’s banking sector and how to delicately balance providing enough incentives to encourage foreign firms against protecting and stimulating Myanmar’s local banking sector.“One advantage of opening the door to foreign banks might be the greater sophistication of the Myanmar financial sector,” said Dr Michael Montesano, visiting research fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.“But this advantage must be weighed against palpable disadvantages,” he said, adding “We must not lose sight of the fact that the development of Myanmar’s own national banking sector must be the highest priority in this area.”Opening up the industry to foreign investment will have immediate challenges resulting in long term benefits for local firms, said U Than Lwin, chairman of leading Myanmar firm Kanbawza (KBZ) bank.“Our own people will become more proficient so in the long run we will benefit quite a lot but in the short term some of the companies may face difficulties in competing,” U Than Lwin said.Boosting the local banking sector is crucial for the long-term benefit of the industry but in the short term some healthy competition and fresh techniques could be the best medicine to kick-start Myanmar’s finance sector, said Dr Aung Thura, chief executive of local research firm Thura Swiss and banking expert.If the initial scope of foreign firms is limited to certain activities then this could give some protection to local banks and give them time to improve practices and effectively catch up to the competition Dr Thura said, adding the local sector was currently ill-prepared to compete against 100 percent foreign owned banks.“Possibly the government can structure it so foreign banks can support areas of the economy not reached by local banks,” Dr Thura said, adding sectors such as retail banking could be reserved for the domestic sector.“I think the government will have to give concessions to foreign banks step by step for different fields of banking,” he said. “First they would need to protect the retail banking market in Myanmar for some time as this is where local banks have their know-how and expertise.”“On the other hand, there are areas of banking that are very global, e.g. investment banking, capital markets where local banks don’t have the expertise, required infrastructure and international network,” Dr Thura said, adding “here it might make sense to give market access to foreign banks in the form of joint ventures.”Several investment models have been proposed, including an offshore banking model, joint venture arrangements and strategic partnerships, where a foreign firm would team up with a local firm, either splitting equally or coming to an agreement where one party retained the majority share, said U Than Lwin.However a joint venture arrangement may be difficult to manage because one party will need the controlling interest, and most foreign firms will demand this as an incentive to invest, he said.“In my view, because Myanmar has been lagging behind for so many years in banking technology, we really need technology and capacity from these foreign banks, so unless the majority share goes to foreign partners, they won’t be satisfied,” U Than Lwin said.But not all local banks will be enthusiastic about entering into joint venture arrangements with foreign partners, said Dr Thura, adding some owners might fear to lose control of their banks.“Conversely, foreign banks might rather wait until complete liberalisation of the banking sector instead of starting with joint ventures,” Dr Thura said.He suggested that compliance challenges might result in some foreign firms opting to start new banks with a local partner instead of entering joint ventures with existing Myanmar banks.Dr Montesano said the entrance of foreign banking firms should be in the context of assisting the expansion of Myanmar’s domestic banks and not in direct competition, adding more needs to be known about the range of activities foreign banks propose to undertake in Myanmar.“Foreign banks ought to be permitted to operate in Myanmar only on the basis of contributions that their activities will make either to that development or to the country’s real economy,” Dr Montesano said. “In any case, all of this must happen in the context of priority being placed on the development of Myanmar institutions,” he said.Not all are in favour of regulating the scope of foreign firms, because as this might protect local banks in the short term it will be at the expense of significant development in the country’s banking industry, said Dr Turnell.“Instead of regulating the scope of foreign firms, Myanmar could allow a combination banking structure, and see which one works best,” Dr Turnell said.“I think a mix of both would be best – allow both joint ventures and full foreign bank entry, and leave it up to the institutions themselves to decide what will work best for them,” he said.Big name banks tipped to be keeping a keen eye on developments in Myanmar’s banking sector include Singapore firms DBS, Union Overseas Bank and the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation, Dr Turnell said, adding the UK’s Standard Chartered, once the country’s leading bank before falling victim to nationalism in 1962, is likely to be the first Western bank to enter Myanmar.Australia’s ANZ bank, which has a strong presence in Cambodia and Laos, has also announced an interest in Myanmar. “We see Myanmar as an opportunity,” said Gilles Planté, CEO Asia for ANZ. “When the time is right, and there is an appropriate opportunity, we will extend our franchise to Myanmar,” Mr Plante said.Japanese banks such as Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), which is providing technical assistance to Myanmar’s KBZ bank, and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, are also likely early entrants, Dr Turnell said.For a country with such an underperforming banking sector, Myanmar hosts a surprisingly large number of banks and many of those institutions will die out or be consumed by the competition, said Dr Turnell.“Many of the smaller banks are effectively moribund. Over time I suspect there will be consolidation in the sector, and we will see a core of about 4 big private banks emerge, with some specialist institutions at the margins,” Dr Turnell said.“Some of the smaller banks will simply disappear, but most will probably merge with some of the larger players over time. Scale matters in banking,” he said.Despite hosting a large number of private and government banks - around 20 banks although less than 10 pc of Myanmar’s population hold a bank account – Myanmar’s economy remains largely cash-driven and banking practices continue to be strictly regulated by the conservative Central Bank, which dictates lending services and places restrictions on the number of branches opened by any one bank.Previous studies show private banks continue to lend more the public sector, turning them into little more than government cash boxes, while strict control by the Central Bank has inhibited private sector lending.“So far Myanmar’s banks, public and private, have been quasi-fiscal vehicles of the State,” Mr Turnell said. “Of course, up until now this has partly been a function of a lack of lending opportunities elsewhere and as the economy grows, this aspect will improve.” “It is still a struggle, and the banks remain greatly constrained by counter-productive regulation that is a hang-over from ‘old military regime Myanmar’,” Mr Turnell said.","/special-features/150-investment-myanmar/2901-banking-sector-comes-under-spotlight.html"
"380",380,"Work halted at copper mine after complaints",2012-08-20,"Business","A senior official at the country’s largest copper mine has denied accusations that Chinese workers at the Sagaing Region site tried to harm local residents whose land has been confiscated as part of a US$1 billion expansion of the mine.          The dispute has resulted in work stopping at the mine, which produces up to 30,000 tonnes of copper a year, and delayed the start of a planned expansion, the official said.Residents told The Myanmar Times that the incident, which highlights the simmering unrest in the area over the confiscation of 7869 acres in Wattmhay, Zeekone, Seltel and Kantkaw villages, occurred after they found officials from the company destroying their crops on the night of December 10, 2011.“The villagers went to stop them and they ran back to their site near the heap leaching area. And three Chinese workers gesticulated rudely to the villagers from on top of the heap,” Ma Thwe Thwe Win from Wattmhay village said on July 30.The Chinese workers also dislodged a “huge” stone from the top of the heap and sent it tumbling towards the residents at the bottom, she said. “We ran back to avoid it. They were trying to kill us, even though there were local government officials and police up there too.”But U Myint Aung, deputy general manager of Myanmar Wanbao Mining Copper Company Limited, dismissed the allegations in an interview at the mine site on July 31.“It was night time so there’s no way they could see what the workers were doing at the top of the heap. I ordered the workers to stop [expanding the heaps] because the villagers were in an unsafe area [if they collapsed],” he said.All work at the mine has been stopped until the situation calms down, he said.The allegations come after residents said they were refused permission to peacefully protest on July 30 by an official from Salingyi township. The protest was to call for the lifting of a section 144 order that enables people to be shot on sight if they enter restricted areas near the leaching heaps, and for the reopening of Wattmhay Monastery, which is in the way of the planned expansion and was shut in December 2011.They also want to be able to continue farming their land and remain in their villages. If that is not possible, they want fair compensation for confiscated land.A senior police officer from Monywa District who asked not to be named said the application to protest, filed under the new Peaceful Protest Law, had been rejected because several residents are facing prosecution for an illegal protest about three months ago in which they allegedly hindered a project truck and damaged its door.U Myint Aung said K5 billion compensation had already been paid for the crops on land compulsorily acquired for the expansion, and the company would pay K3 million in rent a year to the government for each square kilometre used for the project. Relocated residents have been placed in new villages outside the project area but more than half of the 470 affected households have so far refused to move, according to village heads.“We also give from K400,000 to K1 million to the people who had to move depending on the type of house they had. About 200 families have already moved,” he said.As well as being unhappy at having to move, the villagers also said the compensation offered was inadequate and criticised the company for failing to engage with them and explain why it needed to take their land.Ko Tun Tun from Zeekone said the quality of housing provided in the new village was poorer than their original homes and they received just K520,000 to K540,000 an acre compensation, depending on the type of crop grown.“The compensation given to us for land also covers just three years, not the 30 years that the project will operate. And they don’t explain anything to us about the project. We know nothing about it at all,” he said.The land was confiscated for a long-planned expansion of the open-pit mine from the present site at Sabetaung and Kyisintaung to include the nearby Letpadaung hills, U Myint Aung, adding that 33 small mountains will eventually disappear as the copper is extracted.“We actually need more land but for the sake of villagers we took the least amount possible,” he said. “We will be able to produce 100,000 tonnes a year for about 30 years under this project. The investment is $1 billion.”He said expansion work is unable to begin until the dispute with the villagers is resolved, adding that most workers on the project will be Chinese nationals.Myanmar Wanbao Mining Copper is a subsidiary of Chinese arms manufacturer North China Industries Corp, better known as Norinco. It began operating the Monywa mine, about 26 kilometres west of Monywa, in partnership with the Ministry of Mines and army-owned Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (UMEHL) in May 2010, according to Myanmar Wanbao Mining Copper officials. However, Canadian firm Ivanhoe, which previously held a 50 percent stake in the project, says on its website that the sale of its share in the mine did not take place until July 2011, when it received US$103 million. State-owned Mining Enterprise 1 held the other 50pc share under a joint venture established in the 1990s.“The government receives the most under the profit-sharing deal, followed by UMEHL and third Myanmar Wanbao Company,” said U Myint Aung, who is also a project manager for UMEHL.U Aung Myint, a legal adviser for the military-owned company, said UMEHL received the mining permit for the Monywa mine on May 5, 2010.“In the same month we signed the production sharing contract with Myanmar Wanbao Company in front of the ministers for mining of both countries,” he said.He also rejected the accusations of the villagers living near the mine site, including claims of water pollution as a result of its activities.“The use of section 144 near the project area is to protect both villagers and foreign technicians at the site because the leaching heap can collapse at any time. It is not there to be able to shoot anybody,” he said.“The project can destroy some trees but causes no pollution at all. We already calculated it before we started [expanding].”","/business/183-work-halted-at-copper-mine-after-complaints.html"

Collectively the dams will have an installed capacity of 17,259 megawatts (MW). Investment is estimated to be US$3.6 billion.However, in September 2011, President Thein Sein announced a suspension of the Myitsone Dam as 'the will of the people' due to outstanding environemntal concerns.Construction of the Dam began in 2009 and projected revenue generated by the dam was estimated to range between $558-597million a year. China has said if the Dam is cancelled then Myanmar must pay compensation.Tamanthi DamThe government signed an MOU with India’s National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) in 2004 to develop the Tamanthi dam on the Chindwin River in western Sagaing Region. A new agreement was signed in 2008, forming a joint venture to develop Tamanthi as well as Shwesayay dams.The dam will be 80 metres high, with an installed capacity of 1200 MW and an annual production of 6685 Gwh. The estimated cost of the Tamanthi dam is $3 billion. Eighty percent of the electricity will go to India, and the rest will power Monywa mining operations.Construction at the dam site began in 2007, but is subject to delays. A detailed project report (master plan) is being prepared by NHPC.Tasang DamThe Tasang dam is the biggest of five proposed dams along the Thanlwin River in Eastern Myanmar. In July 1996 Thailand signed an MOU with the Myanmar government.Tasang dam is set to be 228 metres in height, with an installed capacity of 7110 MW and an annual production of 35,446 Gwh. When built it will be the highest dam in Southeast Asia, taller than China’s Three Gorges dam. Most of the electricity from the Tasang dam is intended for sale to Thailand. The initial estimated cost of the Tasang dam was $6 billion. However the actual costs are likely to be far higher.Initially signed with Thailand’s MDX Group, China Gezhouba Group Co won a contract for initial dam construction in early 2007. In mid-2008, Sinohydro, China Southern Power Grid Co., and China Three Gorges Project Corporation signed an agreement for the development of the Thanlyin River Basin in Myanmar, including the Tasang dam.Work on the dam has been stalled, and there has been little activity at the dam-site.Yeywa DamThe Myanmar government first announced plans for the Yeywa dam in late 2001. In 2004, MEPE signed an MOU with a consortium of Chinese companies to build the dam on the Myitnge River in Mandalay Division. It is one of the largest roller-compacted concrete (RCC) dams in the world.The dam is 134 metres high with an installed capacity of 790 MW and an annual production of 3550 Gwh. MEPE signed an agreement with a consortium created by China International Trust & Investment Co (CITIC) and Sinohydro Corporation in 2004. The overall cost is estimated at $700m.Construction was completed in 2010.Lawpita Hydropower ProjectLawpita Hydropower Project in Kayah State was initiated in 1950 with a bilateral war reparation agreement between Japan and Myanmar. Lawpita was the first large-scale hydropower project in Myanmar. The project remains an important source of electricity for central Myanmar, representing 24percent of Myanmar’s total hydropower capacity.Lawpita Hydropower Plant No 2 was the co untry’s first power station to become operational, completed in 1974. It has a capacity of 168 MW with six generators.Construction of Plant No.1 began in 1986 and was completed in 1992. It has an installed capacity of 28 MW.Dagwin DamThe Dagwin, or Lower Thanlwin dam will serve as a pumped storage facility for the upriver Weigyi dam. Dagwin is estimated at 56 meters high, with an installed capacity of 792 MW.Although the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) has been involved in planning the Dagwin dam since the early 1980s, in April 2008, three companies from China signed a strategic cooperation agreement.The cost of building the Dagwin dam is estimated at $900m.Dapeyin DamState-owned China Datang Company has agreements to build two dams on the Dapein River near the China border, involving state-owned Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise. The dams will have an installed capacity of 408 MW. Total cost is reportedly 108 million Yuan. ninety percent of the electricity will be sold to China.Construction of the Debeyin 1 hydropower station began on December 19, 2007 and was completed and started distributing electricity in February 2011. Work continues on Dam 2.Upper and Lower Paunglaung DamsIn March 2005, MEPE, along with financial and construction support from Chinese companies, completed the Lower Paunglaung dam on the Paunglaung River. The dam is 131 metres in height and an installed capacity of 280 MW.The Upper Paunglaung dam is under construction and is expected to be completed in 2012. The dam will be 103 metres high, with installed capacity of 140 MW and an annual production of 454 Gwh (million kilowatt hours yearly).Both dams provide power for Myanmar’s capital, Nay Pyi Taw.Shweli DamsMyanmar’s Ministry of Electric Power signed its first Build-Operate-Transfer agreement with China for a hydropower dam on the Shweli River, a tributary of the Ayeyarwady, in northern Shan State in 2006. Two additional dams are planned downstream.The dams will have a total installed capacity of 1440 MW. Investment could reach $1.4 billion. Electricity will be transmitted to China and government-run mining operations in Myanmar.The project is a joint venture between MEPE and Yunnan Joint Power Development Company.Ywathit DamIn January 2010, the Chinese state-owned Datang Corporation signed an MOU with the Myanmar government to build three dams in Kayah State, including a 600 MW dam on the mainstream Thanlwin at Ywathit, and two others on its tributaries, the Pawn and Thabet rivers. Ywathit dam will have an installed capacity of 600 MW and investment is estimated to reach $600m.Weigyi DamThe Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) signed an MOU with Myanmar on December 9, 2005 for the development of Weigyi to provide electricity for Thailand. The dam will be 168 metres high and an installed capacity of between 4540 and 5600 MW. Construction costs are estimated at $3 billion. Most of the electricity from the Weigyi dam is intended for sale to Thailand.Upper Thanlwin Dam (Kunlong)In April 2007, two Chinese companies, Hanergy Holding Group Company and Gold Water Resources Company Limited, signed an MOU with the Myanmar government for the Upper Thanlwin dam in northern Shan State. Installed capacity will be 2400 MW.The two sides signed the memorandum of agreement in Nay Pyi Taw in February 2010.The project is under implementation.Hatgyi DamMyanmar’s Ministry of Electric Power, EGAT, and China’s Sinohydro signed an agreement in 2006 for the joint implementation of the Hatgyi dam on the Thanlwin River in Karen State.The dam will be 33 metres high, have an installed capacity of 1200 MW and an annual production of 7335 Gwh. The estimated cost of building the Hatgyi dam is $1 billion. Most of the electricity from the dam is intended for sale to Thailand.Thailand is pushing for it to be the first of the dams built on the Thanlwin River. Once built, it will pave the way for the building of the other larger dams.Construction of the Hatgyi dam has begun. Commercial distribution of power was projected to begin in 2013-2014, however, EGAT has announced it will be 2019.","/special-features/151-energy-spotlight/2943-current-development-of-major-hydropower-projects.html"
"382",382,"Myitsone should not resume, say experts and locals",2012-08-20,"Energy Spotlight","Activists and local residents are renewing calls that the Myitsone dam project cannot be allowed to resume in the face of continuing efforts by China to restart.          The Ministry of Electrical Power 1 signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China Power Investment Corporation (CPI) on December 28, 2006 to implement the US$3.6 billion Myitsone Dam.It is one of seven dams to be built by CPI, a Chinese state-owned entity, on the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwady River in Kachin State. The dam would be capable of generating more than 6000 megawatts.However, after a sustained nationwide campaign against the project and its social and environmental consequences, President U Thein Sein announced on September 30 2011 it was to be suspended for at least the five-year term of his government.But the question remains whether Myitsone would resume after U Thein Sein’s administration ends in 2015.China has stated that if Myanmar wants to stop the project completely, it will need to solve the situation legally and provide compensation for the contract.U Ko Ko Hlaing, chief political adviser to President U Thein Sein, said the president’s stance on the issue had not changed since he suspended the dam on September 30 “in accordance with the wishes of the public”.“It is still the president’s stance but we are not sure whether it will restart under the next government,” he told The Myanmar Times.“The government has two duties: one is to fulfil the people’s desire and the other is to continue projects started by the previous government under an international law called the Law of State Succession. In this case, the previous government and China signed an official contract so if we break this contract, we must compensate them. We need to consider whether people are willing to compensate them or not,” he said.“I believe that the government can find the best solution between the people’s desire and its duties.”Foreign minister, U Wunna Maung Lwin, paid a visit to China in October 2011 where he met with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping and Chinese Foreign Minister Yan Jiechi to ensure ‘mutual benefits’ between the two countries.According to AFP, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Liu Weiman, said the meeting had been arranged “to handle this project in the proper way and continue to move forward with bilateral relations which are very important for us”.“If they [China] want to get compensation, I want the government to compensate them. I think the public feels the same as me,” said U Win Myo Thu, managing director of Ecodev (Economically Progressive Ecosystems Development).Concerns remain, however, that the Chinese government and CPI is continuing to push for a restart to the dam project by lobbying the government, persuading local residents, extolling the advantages of building the dam via the media and even asking the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD) to conduct a third party assessment of the project.“Now, they [China] have asked ICOLD to be a third party. But I think ICOLD is biased because they want dams built. It is unacceptable,” said U Win Myo Thu.“Dam builders are always more interested in the construction of a dam,” he said to The Myanmar Times last week.Another reason to reject ICOLD participation, he added, is the fact that CPI executives dominate the organisation’s high ranking executive members.However, the ICOLD published a statement in May, to say that had received a request from “the builder of the Irrawaddy Myitsone dam project in Myanmar” to assess its work, but clarified that it is “not entitled to evaluate a particular dam project and has never been engaged in any mission to do so.”The ICOLD went on to say that, independently of the project, Myanmar had moved to become a full member last year.“Myanmar knows that dams are a crucial tool for development and wishes to share the technical knowledge with the 95 countries composing ICOLD,” the statement said.However, experts say that not only is further scientific research on the long term implications of building dams on the Ayeyarwady required, it needs to be combined with an appreciation of how to mitigate social and environmental effects.“It is not enough to say the fundamental way to solve all these ecological problems is to develop hydropower according to a scientific approach. It cannot only be solved by technological and scientific means, it has to be integrated in a socio-technological way that meets a triple bottom line of being financially beneficial, environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive,” Dr Khin Ni Ni Thein said at an environmental talk held at the Excel Treasure Tower, entitled ‘Our Ayeyarwady Our Future’ on July 16.“They can build a dam over the Ayeyarwady river but it must be done with an Integrated Water Resource Management System,” Dr Khin Ni Ni Thein, founder and president of Water Research and Training Centre, said.Experts have questioned whether enough has been done to assess the environmental and social impacts of the Myitsone dam project, saying that the project should not be renewed until these have been properly addressed.“I do not see any improvement of the environment because of hydro-power development,” said U Ohn, vice president of FREDA (Forest Resources and Environmental Development Association).“On the other hand, if China really wants to implement this project for the sake of the Myanmar people, why don’t they publish any EIA-Environmental Impact Assessment and SIA-Social Impact Assessment for the people.“China as a neighbour to Myanmar needs to show their sincerity first and talk later. Now, we all feel that Sittwe [Kyaukphyu] pipe line is just to divide our country into two halves,” U Ohn said, referring to the Shwe gas pipeline project to export gas to China.There are calls the government should open the issue to the public and solve it through parliamentary debate.“The public needs to be able to research as much as they can about Ayeyarwady and discuss [their concerns] with their representatives … It is very important that the state and public combine. The public have the right to say what they want. We can say our desire through the Hluttaw because they promise to listen to the public voice and act in accordance with the public desire. I think the Hluttaw [members] will accept our words if we say in good will,” said Dr Khin Ni Ni Thein.“The state owns all natural resources in accordance with the constitution. However, citizens must have a say on management and allocation of our natural resources according to their rights. So, if we agree to build the Myitsone dam it must be for the energy needs of our country, not for them [China]. In the future, energy security will become very important in the world. So, why should we give our energy to China,” U Win Myo Thu said.There have also been calls from local residents that uncertainty over the dam is making life more difficult.“At the moment we are living with uncertainty and fear,” U Tu Hkaung, a villager of Temphre village told The Myanmar Times earlier this year.Despite the dam’s suspension, many villagers have already been relocated away from the project site to a new village site, Aung Myin Thar Sanpya, and are facing struggles to their livelihood.Many villagers have expressed they are not willing to live in the new villages and attempted to secure official permission to return home because the farmland at the new villages is not good enough to sustain their livelihoods.Villagers who have attempted to return to their old homes have been arrested and local authorities forced them to sign a disclosure not to return saying the companies have already provided compensation for their land and crops.However, villagers from Temphre, Myitsone and Lepe villages sent a letter to the state minister and the president on March 17 to request permission to continue their old farming.“They [state authorities] didn’t take any action despite us returning to our village to farm after sending the letter to the president. As they didn’t say anything officially we are continuing to farm but it is unofficial. We know they can arrest us at any time,” said U Tu Hkaung.At present, there are 327 households in Aung Myin Thar Sanpya village housing villagers from Temphre, Myitsone and Lepe villages.“There are 50 households in Temphre village, we go between the new and old villages because we still do our business in the old villages, but live in the new village for education and health services. There is no school or clinic in the old village as they were moved to the new village,” said U Tu Hkaung.CPI representatives have begun to pay visits to the new village and offer assistance to the villagers.“On April 16, they [CPI] come to our village and asked us what difficulties we face. They explained to us the advantages of building the dam, saying we can get higher incomes and jobs through the project. They promised to support us with donations of rice and in May gave eight pyi [one pyi equal 2.13kg] for each person. We accepted it but we didn’t thank them because they created this suffering first, and only now are they showing their sympathy,” said U Tu Khaung.“We ask everyone to help our situation and save the Ayeyarwady. If they build the Myitsone dam, we will suffer more difficulties. We don’t agree that the project should be resumed,” saidDuring the ‘Our Ayeyarwady Our Future’ talk, Friar Thomas from the Roman Catholic Church in Temphre village requested continued support to ensure the dam project does not negatively affect his community further.Members of the 88 Generation of students present at the talk pledged to help protect Ayeyarwady as much as they can.“We have to do more awareness programs from the grassroots level,” Ko Jimmy said at the talk.“It is not enough that President U Thein Sein postponed the Myitsone dam project in his administration. It is important to advocate having candidates who will guarantee the preservation of the Ayeyarwady river in the upcoming 2015 general election,” he said.","/special-features/151-energy-spotlight/2935-myitsone-should-not-resume-say-experts-and-locals.html"
"383",383,"Managing Myanmar’s resource wealth",2012-08-13,"National News","Myanmar is a country blessed with abundant natural resources. Wrapped in magnificent forests, it has a fabulous climate for growing food and significant reserves of oil and gas, as well as other precious commodities like hardwood timber, jade and rubies. Yet this abundance has not yet translated into wealth and benefits for the ordinary citizen.          In many countries, the business of managing natural resources often happens in frontier areas and is characterised by secret deals and off-budget revenues. At Global Witness, we have documented around the world how unaccountable resource management can drive discontent, poverty and conflict. Our best received work to date within Myanmar was our effort to improve understanding of illegal timber extraction in its northern regions, and the negative impact that this had on the environment, local livelihoods and peacebuilding. The issue attracted widespread attention among decision-makers in Myanmar and China, as well as civil society and local communities, which ultimately led to a significant slowdown in exploitative timber exports.What can now be done to manage Myanmar’s natural resources better in the new era of openness and reform in the country? We would like to suggest that three key reforms are necessary.First, the government needs an over-arching plan on how to manage its land and all its natural resources in the public interest.That plan needs broad popular consultation and buy-in from citizens, political parties, local authorities and investors. If the state’s efforts to attract foreign investment are not matched by efforts to safeguard local people’s rights and the environment, Myanmar risks escalating social and political tensions.Communities should be informed and consulted in a meaningful manner when proposed projects may affect the lands and resources they depend on. The first time that an ordinary citizen finds out about a deal should not be when they are evicted to make way for a land or resource concessionRequiring decision-making and contracting of investments to be open would not only benefit local communities but also enable the government to make more informed decisions and negotiate more equitable deals when allocating commercial rights to Myanmar’s resources. Investors would also benefit from operating in a level playing field, as well as reduced risks of corruption, contract insecurity and damaging conflicts with communities.Reforms are also necessary at the crucial project licensing stage, which determines how and to whom contracts for resource exploitation are allocated. The licensing process must be open, with pre-qualified companies, the terms of the bids and the eventual winner fully disclosed once the auction has been completed. Regulators should make their rationale for choosing particular firms clear and transparent, and enforce laws requiring companies to disclose their real (beneficial) owners. Contracts and concession agreements need to be made public and project implementation based on the free, prior and informed consent of local communities.Second, ordinary citizens need to be able to follow the money from natural resource extraction. The basic rules of the resource business need to favour disclosure of information rather than secrecy at every point along the chain. This allows for the public to scrutinise resource deals, hold the state to account over how income from resource extraction is spent and reduces the risk of corruption, which has plagued extractive industries across the world.President U Thein Sein’s confirmation that Myanmar is preparing to become a signatory to an international initiative promoting the tracking of revenues from oil and mining is a welcome first step in this direction. “The most important thing,” the president said, “is to have completely transparent financial accounting to ensure everyone knows where the revenues from these extractive industries are going.”The Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) works by bringing together government, businesses and civil society to track the money flowing from the natural resource business. EITI compares what companies have paid to the government to what the government said it has received. Any discrepancies can then be investigated. The EITI is an acknowledged global standard and is being implemented in 35 countries around the world, from Norway to Peru. In total some 900 companies have disclosed about US$600 billion of revenues under the scheme and some $20 billion of discrepancies have been investigated and resolved.It is not just civil society that strongly supports EITI. Perhaps the most convincing testimony comes from implementing governments, such as East Timor or Mongolia, which clearly attest to its importance in promoting reform efforts in their country. International investors managing some $13 trillion of assets also see EITI as an important tool to mitigate risk for the companies and countries that they invest in. Major companies in Myanmar that support EITI include Chevron of the United States and Total of France. It is worth emphasising that EITI has grown to also involve Chinese companies, such as Chinese National Petroleum Corporation, which is active in Myanmar.Transparency and disclosure in the natural resource sector is not just about citizen accountability. It is also a risk management strategy for companies wanting to invest in the country and the government.In a country like Myanmar, where public debate on the management of these resources has been limited until recently, and where reform programs are gathering pace, EITI membership can be a catalyst for civil society to develop and grow by using EITI data to begin to hold decision-makers to account.The initiative has been most successful when it is clearly included in domestic legislation and when it requires detailed reporting on an individual project basis, which provides details that enable local citizens to track the resources from their area.The government also needs a joined-up approach to its implementation. New offshore energy blocks are due to be tendered while Myanmar is just starting discussions on implementing EITI. Any new contracts need to reflect this new approach to transparency.Crucial to the success of the initiative is giving civil society both the space and the support to participate in the initiative. A sustained effort will be needed to not only ensure that civil participation is protected but also that local civil society has the required capacity and expertise on this issue.Our third and final recommendation: the resource business needs to be embedded in wider reforms to improve the rule of law, freedom of information and proper government financial management. One simple example: disclosures from the resource business need to map over to a transparent public budget process with clear rules on how the government intends to spend and save citizens’ money in accordance with national development priorities. There also needs to be a clear process to review how that money was spent. Major investment or infrastructure projects also need to be properly governed and transparently managed, of course, as does spending on critical sectors such as defence, education and health. Politicians need to file asset declarations.There’s a famous Buddhist proverb: “Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth.” The truth about the management of Myanmar’s natural resources now needs to come to fore. President U Thein Sein and his government’s commitment to revenue transparency through the EITI is the right place to start but they should not stop here if they are truly committed to tackling Myanmar’s resource curse.(Gavin Hayman is director of campaigns at Global Witness, an international non-government organisation.)","/national-news/149-managing-myanmar-s-resource-wealth.html"
"384",384,"Mining summit shows  international interest,  lack of local capacity",2012-07-30,"Business","A mining summit held in Yangon last week showed the huge interest in the country’s mineral deposits but many delegates admitted that their visits were little more than window shopping.          Held at Sedona Hotel from July 22-24, the Myanmar Mining Summit offered many of the delegates their first real look at Myanmar, which has been largely closed to foreign investors courtesy of Western sanctions.The event, the first of its kind for the country, drew roughly 300 attendees from 26 countries in the fields of mining, geology, law, and mining related finance. The turnout was a testament to the considerable interest in the largely unexplored nation, where mining accounts for only 1 percent of gross domestic product.The summit was widely lauded as a positive step forward in the transparency of a key economic sector as Myanmar gradually warms to foreign business interests.It marked a rare opportunity for investors to meet high-ranking government officials, including Minister for Mines U Thein Htaik, who addressed the summit on July 23.Mr Alisher Ali, chairman of Silk Road Finance, spoke of Myanmar’s “transformation” in his opening address.“Myanmar is in the process of a historical transformation and everyone who has made an effort to come here to Yangon takes that historical opportunity seriously,” he said.Notable foreign presenters included mining veteran Mr Owen Hegarty, chairman of Tigers Realm Group and Tigers Realm Metals; Mr Chris de Lavigne, global vice president of industrial practices at Frost & Sullivan; and Mr Hideyuki Ueda, executive director, metals strategy and exploration at Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (Jogmec).U Win Htein, director general of the Ministry for Mines; U Kyi Htun, independent geology consultant; and U Than Maung, lawyer from Kelvin Chia Yangon Ltd, joined from the Myanmar side.The lack of international experience in Myanmar’s mining sector was most evident when officials from the Ministry for Mines opened the floor to questions from audience members. Inquiries regarding copper and gold production estimates, access to geophysical data archives and the number of exploration drillings that have been done in Myanmar were largely sidestepped by ministry officials.The lack of straightforward answers carried over to pieces of regulatory framework, notably the timeframe for mining and exploration licences to be processed and approved, and what is required to secure a title.Mr Jon North, president and chief executive officer of Canadian mineral exploration company Northquest Ltd, admitted that his exploration licence had not yet been cleared but remains “very optimistic that it will be approved”.Northquest has been in the country since January but Mr North described its role as “geological tourists”, at that time due to sanctions.However, the biggest stumbling block for potential miners is Myanmar’s 30-70 production sharing contract (PSC) between the private party and the Ministry for Mines.Under the Mines Law, enacted in 1994, the Ministry of Mines acts a non-equity partner but is still entitled to 30pc of minerals extracted, plus the relevant income tax and royalties owed.“Until PSCs are reworked or abolished, we won’t be doing business here,” said one Australian industry veteran, echoing the feelings of many delegates. Yet another area of concern is a rule banning exports of ore, coal, gold and gemstones. The lack of access to gemstones did not hold much of a surprise – foreign investors have long been forced to buy gems for export at government gem expos but the regulations on coal and gold were less expected.“It did throw a lot of people,” said Mr Damian Adams, partner at the law firm Watson, Farley and Williams Asia Practice.Gold and coal are of particular interest to Myanmar’s commodity hungry neighbours – India and China.India was the world’s largest importer of gold in 2011 and in 2010 imported 746 tonnes of the precious metal, nearly twice the second-largest market, according to the World Gold Council. Many citizens in the country see the metal as a safe investment and it plays an essential role in traditional wedding ceremonies.China’s ferocious appetite for coal only grew in the first half of 2012, rising 66pc with the country importing 140 million tonnes, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs in Beijing on July 10. Imports are expected to double by 2015.“Domestic demand is more than what we produce, so we cannot export it,” said Daw Mya Thu Za, an expert on foreign investment at the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA) in regards to the ban on coal exports.Myanmar has shown a willingness to listen to mining entities and take into inconsideration changes that would make the regulatory framework less inhibiting.Minister for Mines U Thein Htaik said the ministry was “trying to amend the Myanmar Mines Law with the advice of experts”, but an exact date of the release of the new laws has not been announced.“Some investors are waiting for the new mining laws. They are hoping to have a new mining law within the coming months,” said Mr Adams, who reiterated that Myanmar is only beginning to test the mining waters and that given time it has the opportunity to adjust to the needs and demands of investors, while not ignoring local business interests.“It is a blank sheet of paper here,” Mr Adams said. “People are waiting to see how it [mining law] is passed and implemented to see how to move forward. The concern is when they can jump in.”Conspicuously lacking on the list of attendees were representatives from Myanmar’s largest investor, China, which accounts for US$20 billion in foreign direct investment according to DICA. Only six China-based companies were in attendance.The limited participation was a sign that the sanction years have given China a lengthy head-start over other foreign companies not just in mining but across all sectors of Myanmar’s economy.Aerospace and defense firm Chinese North Industries Company (Norinco), through subsidiary Myanmar Wanbao Mining Copper, is a partner with the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd in Sagaing Region’s Monywa copper mine, the largest mining project in Myanmar to date.Additionally, Myanmar-China Non Ferrous Metal and Mining is working with Mining Enterprise Number 3 on a $1 billion nickel mining project in Mandalay Region.Mr Ali, however, believes that catching up will be a fast process, especially for US companies.“Very quickly, US companies will use sharp political leadership which will encourage US investment. There will be deals with large US firms like Caterpillar, Chevron and giants from the fast food industry. These names have a big weight, both financially and politically,” said Mr Ali.The three-day event was organised by the Ministry of Mines and Centre for Management Technology.","/business/311-mining-summit-shows-international-interest-lack-of-local-capacity.html"
"385",385,"Who’s already in Myanmar?",2012-07-30,"Business","Myanmar's largest mining project, the Monywa copper mine in Sagaing Region, was a joint venture between state-owned Mining Enterprise 1 and a subsidiary of Ivanhoe Mines of Canada. However, in March 2007 Ivanhoe announced it planned to sell its stake in the project and it was sold to a subsidiary of Chinese arms manufacturer Norinco, Myanmar Yang Tse Copper, about two years ago. Army-run Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd is also involved in the project, according to industry sources.          At Tagaungtaung in northern Mandalay Region, Myanmar-China Non Ferrous Metal & Mining has a production sharing contract with Mining Enterprise 3 for nickel mining as part of a project worth almost US$1 billion.Other investors include Nobel Gold, which has an exploration licence for gold and associated minerals in Banmauk, Sagaing Region, and Cornerstone Resources (Myanmar), which is looking for zinc in Shan State’s Mong Pan township, a spokesperson from the Myanmar Geosciences Society said.Some companies have also received approval from the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) to start work, he said.“North Mining Investment is going to look for ferro nickel alloy in Tiddim, Chin State. Simco Song Da joint stock company has also got MIC approval to look for marble at Nayputaung in Taunggok township, Rakhine State,” he said.Jogmec from Japan is exploring for antimony at Kalaw in Shan State, while Myanmar Pongpipat has a production sharing contract with Mining Enterprise 2 for a tin mine in Tanintharyi Region. Kenbo Group from China is looking for nickel in Mwetaung in Chin State, while some local companies, including Asia World, are also active.An application by Asia Pacific Mining to explore for gold, lead, copper and thorium at Kantbalu and Wuntho in Sagaing Region was recently rejected by the Ministry of Mines for undisclosed reasons.","/business/308-who-s-already-in-myanmar.html"
"386",386,"‘Staggering fortunes’ possible in Myanmar: Rogers",2012-07-23,"Business","Investor Jim Rogers, Chairman of Rogers Holdings, Beeland Interests Inc and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, is bullish on Myanmar’s growth, dubbing it, “probably the best investment opportunity in the world right now”.          Mr Rogers, a fan of long-haul cross-continent journeys, first visited Myanmar in 2001 where he says he fell in love with the country and realised its tremendous untapped potential.“I saw a disciplined, educated, ambitious workforce,” said Rogers, in a telephone interview, “and vast, vast mineral resources.”With the easing of Western economic sanctions against Myanmar following from the government’s steps towards democratisation and economic reform, Myanmar has quickly found itself the focus of investors who see it and its 60 million people one of the world’s last unexplored markets.The money Mr Rogers believes can be made in the near future is rooted in the success the country found before being largely shut-off from the rest of the world.“In 1962, Burma was the richest country in Asia. Then they closed and [now] it is the poorest. They are doing the same thing China did. In 1978 China, which had been closed, said, ‘Look, this isn’t working’. I have seen this many times in many countries.”Mr Rogers said the lack of telecommunications, only 4 percent of the population owns a mobile phone and SIM cards cost more than US$250, an outdated and underfunded healthcare system and a shortage of sufficient hotels for tourists, represent just a fraction of the possibilities.“Everything,” said Mr Rogers when asked about which sectors appeared prime for investment, “everything has opportunity, you name it. There are staggering opportunities in anything you can think of.”China is Myanmar’s largest source of foreign investment and has never applied sanctions on its southern neighbour.Despite these close ties and signs of a cooling Chinese economy, Mr Rogers is not worried about the impact it may have. He cites Myanmar’s position on the economic ground floor as a reason that upward movement is the only direction possible.“It is starting from ground zero. I can’t think of a better neighbour to have in the 21st century than China,” he said, “I wouldn’t worry about what happens to the rest of the world.”Mr Rogers, a long time proponent of the agricultural sector, again points to Myanmar’s past success as a reason to be excited for the future. In 1934 it led the world by exporting 3.3 million tonnes of rice.“Fifty years ago it was the rice basket of Asia and the potential is there again. The sky is the limit,” he said, “Staggering fortunes will be made in agriculture in Myanmar in the next decades.”The government has set a goal to increase rice exports by almost a fifth, hoping to reach 1 million tonnes in the 2012-13 fiscal year. The increase is seen as a challenge to Myanmar’s ASEAN counterparts Thailand and Vietnam, which exported 10 million and 7.2 million tonnes in 2011, respectively.Although new ventures into Myanmar are seen largely as a positive step for the country, some watch groups fear that ongoing ethnic struggles and human rights violations are being overlooked for the sake of business.The US Campaign for Burma, United to End Genocide and Human Rights Watch widely denounced the US announcement allowing companies to work with Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) on July 13. Opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has criticised MOGE because it lacks, “transparency and accountability at present”.Mr Rogers disagrees and believes that foreign investment will not only bring with it dearly needed capital for the country, but also more expertise, more competition and a diverse range of view points.“If you go from 0 human rights to 13 it is better,” said Mr Rogers, “It is better than boycotting and closing the place off. Exposure to the outside world is always better than boycotting.”With his infectiously enthusiastic outlook and past success, Mr Rogers has undoubtedly set many scrambling to locate Myanmar on the map and he offers some words of advice for those looking to cash in.“Most people cannot spell Myanmar. They need to educate themselves and find a knowledgeable, local partner.”","/business/321-staggering-fortunes-possible-in-myanmar-rogers.html"
"387",387,"Australian businesses set to boost Myanmar stake",2012-06-25,"Business","Australian firms are being tipped to take up the challenge of investing in Myanmar following the early June announcement by Foreign Minister Bob Carr to lift all remaining travel and financial sanctions on the country.          In Yangon, the lobbies and bars of the city’s high-end hotels have transformed into impromptu offices for foreign investors – including a new stream of Australians – seeking their fortune in the resource-rich country.“Right now, Myanmar is a blank canvas,” one investor said. “And we’re the artists.”A Yangon-based business consultant said some Australian construction and agricultural firms are already exploring investment opportunities in Myanmar.“There’s been interest from a Brisbane-based property development and construction company specialising in modular building systems that could possibly service Myanmar’s huge demand for hotel and serviced accommodation,” he said.He added that representatives from oil and gas giant BHP Petroleum recently visited.“BHP have been revisiting the previous onshore opportunities in the oil and gas sector and no doubt eyeing the lucrative offshore market,” the consultant said.“And if you’ve got BHP Petroleum coming in here then it would be highly likely BHP Billiton will be hot on their heels.”Australia’s mining expertise, he added, could provide essential technology to help exploit Myanmar’s rich resource reserves.Nestled between the heavyweight economies of India and China, Myanmar has proven natural resources, including oil and gas, minerals, gems and forestry, and vast potential for new agricultural projects.Recent political and economic reforms by President U Thein Sein’s government have been rewarded as many Western nations – including the United States, Europe and Australia – suspended or lifted sanctions restricting trade and investment and stepped up aid and development budget commitments.Myanmar economy expert and professor at Macquarie University Sean Turnell said Australian expertise in areas such as agriculture was in high demand.“Australia has a lot to offer Burma as we are a big, rich resource/agricultural-led economy while Burma is a big but poor resource-rich agricultural economy,” Prof Turnell said.He added that Australia could step up its presence in Myanmar as an alternative to Chinese or Asian investment.“The biggest players here are other Asian countries and in that there is a bit of an upside for Australia.“There’s a real hankering for connections with the West, mostly the US because it’s the most visible, but in a sense Australia could profit from that.”However, Mr Turnell said many investors had been surprised by how difficult it was to do business in Myanmar. Limited infrastructure and restrictive legal and economic conditions are the main hindrances to international investment, he said.U Myat Thu Winn, managing director of Shwe Minn Tha Enterprises Co, a family-owned group of real estate, media and printing companies, said foreign investment in the construction and tourism sectors could give a much needed shot in the arm to the country’s economy and provide jobs for thousands.“I understand that if you’re a businessman you’re trying to make money, but I encourage new foreign investors to think of how they can also contribute to the community,” U Myat Thu Winn said.Tim Harcourt, former chief economist of Austrade, the Australian government’s trade and investment arm, said investors have much to offer Myanmar.“Australia could help Burma develop its rural industries as well as in education and training in tourism in much the same way as in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.“The emphasis will be in capacity building and helping people to reach their potential. But it would be a ‘softly, softly’ approach provided the pro-democracy reforms continue.”","/business/542-australian-businesses-set-to-boost-myanmar-stake.html"

The event was co-organised by Guangxi’s Department of Commerce, the Directorate of Trade, under the Ministry of Commerce, and the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry.Major participants included Guangxi Liugong Machinery Co, Dongfeng Liuzhou Motor Co, Guangxi Yuchai Machinery Co and Guangxi Sanhuan Enterprise Group Holdings Co.Regional sales manager for Liu Gong Machinery Co, Mr Andy Zhong, said: “We are seeing more demand for this year compared with the previous year because we see more potential from the Myanmar market with its rapid economic growth and more stable political situations.”Liu Gong Company signed a contract with Myanmar Aung Gyi Group of Companies to import 120 pieces of machinery worth $10 million, said Andy Zhong.He said the company expected to see its 2012 sales to Myanmar expand by 65pc year-on-year.“This year we’re targeting sales of 300 units worth $20 million.

"389",389,"United States nowhere when it comes to Laos",2012-02-27,"Opinion","China and Vietnam are the twin planks that keep Laos afloat.          Barely a month goes by without leadership delegations from Beijing and Hanoi descending on Vientiane, as they both have already done this month.That these visits are invariably fruitful is no surprise. Indeed, it is hard for anyone to visit Laos without falling in love with the place.The problem comes when you stay longer and try to conduct business or other activities that demand concerted effort and a deadline.For, by and large, Laotians reject the obsessive urge to seek material gain as fast as possible that drives modern life across the rest of the region.It appears to have always been that way. And many hope it always will be.Back in 1960, however, United States President Dwight Eisenhower did not think so and he urged his successor John Kennedy to focus on Laos, which, he claimed, was “the cork in the bottle” of Southeast Asia.More disastrously misguided advice is hard to imagine, and it caused Kennedy tremendous heartache.For rather than a cork, Laos is more like the dregs at the base of an old bottle of uncertain vintage that, for safety’s sake, is best left undisturbed.Back then, though, Kennedy did not know this and was naturally perturbed, so he asked his man in Vientiane for a reading of the situation and of the folks there.Ambassador Winthrop Brown cabled back: “They’re charming, indolent, enchanting people. They’re just not very vigorous.”Hardly revelatory, but then Brown did add that Phoumi Nosavan, the rightwing military thug backed by the US Central Intelligence Agency, was totally useless and lacked battlefield experience.Two months later, upon receiving another similar cable, Kennedy fumed: “General Phoumi is a total shit!”He was. But he was also very proficient at setting up gambling and opium dens to make up a shortfall in revenue after Kennedy belatedly cut off aid in February 1962.The income from his illicit activities only bought Phoumi a short respite and three years later he was forced into exile in Thailand, where he died in 1985, as unremembered as most Lao leaders – even the present ones.We all know Prime Minister Hun Sen. And already his relatively new counterparts like Malaysia’s Najib Razak, Myanmar’s U Thein Sein and Thailand’s Yingluck Shinawatra and are well known.But General Choummaly Sayasone? Who is he?Well, as his official biography reveals, Comrade Choummaly joined the revolution in 1954 and rose through the military ranks to become head of the armed forces.Then, after helping his fellow Pathet Lao Communists seize power in 1975, he continued rising and became head of the party and state president in 2006.He’s now been in charge for nearly six years, yet hardly anyone, except his colleagues in Beijing and Hanoi, recognises him.That may explain why those regular and highly significant visits also go mostly unnoticed.Earlier this month, for instance, a Chinese delegation led by former Shanxi governor Yuan Chunqing came to reaffirm major development assistance, like the high-speed rail project to link southern China with Vientiane.And this year, Soochow University, China’s oldest private varsity, will open the country’s first overseas campus in Laos costing US$25 million.Not to be outdone, Vietnam’s President Truong Tan Sang arrived in Vientiane soon after to celebrate bilateral solidarity and endorse the “special relationship” between the two countries.Last month, Vietnam’s Long Thanh Golf Investment & Trade Co agreed to build Laos’s first special economic zone, which will boost Hanoi’s current $3.6 billion of investments in its neighbour.China remains Laos’s largest investor, but Vietnam is its second largest – and its prime political overlord. The Americans are nowhere in sight.Indeed, astonishingly, Laos has never hosted a cabinet-level official from the US.Although, when you read back over those ambassadorial cables, it is hardly unexpected.The Lao people may be indolent and lack vigour, but they’re not dumb.","/opinion/1150-united-states-nowhere-when-it-comes-to-laos.html"
"390",390,"Govt cuts coal plant from Dawei project",2012-01-16,"National News","Environmental activists appear to have notched another victory over foreign investors, after the government announced last week that a planned 4000-megawatt coal power plant in Dawei would not go ahead.          U Khin Maung Soe, Minister of Electric Power 2, told journalist on January 9 at the Yangon Electricity Supply Board headquarters in Ahlone township that the ministries of energy, industry and electric power 1 and 2 had “already decided” not to allow the plant to go ahead.The minister said the cancellation was due to “fear of the adverse effects on the environment”.“We saw journals publishing articles on the adverse effects of the coal-fired power plant. We read them and decided that we should not do it,” he said.However, he said the ministries were still discussing whether to allow a 400MW coal plant at the special economic zone in Tanintharyi Region.“We are sure we will not work on the 4000MW plant. However, we need a 400MW to support the [project] and we are discussing whether to go ahead with it or not. We are asking the ministry that handles environmental work to do some calculations and consider it,” he said.Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding was to build the 4000MW plant under a memorandum of understanding it signed with Italian-Thai Development, the developer of the special economic zone, in November 2011.However, the power plant came up against stiff opposition from some Dawei residents, who in December organised a press conference in Yangon to voice their concerns to local media.Ko Myo Aung, a social worker and Dawei resident, said he hoped the government did not allow any coal-fired power plants to be built. He said the power plant would mostly be for the benefit of foreign-owned industry.“It is not that we don’t want to see development of our region but building a coal-fired power plant in our region is like someone making a fire and cooking rice in front of our house and serving the cooked rice to another village. The rice being cooked near us will not be served to us,” he said.News of the cancellation surprised the project's investors, who only two days earlier had travelled to Myanmar to meet government officials.Ratchaburi president Noppol Milinthanggoon said his company had not received official notification from the government of the cancellation.The Bangkok Post reported that investors were confident the power plant would still be built, possibly using a cleaner fuel.A spokesperson from the Yangon Electricity Supply Board confirmed the Dawei project could instead be powered by natural gas or connected to the national electricity grid.The cancellation has also raised concerns about the investment climate at a time when the government is trying to attract more foreign investment. It also comes after the government suspended work on the unpopular Myitsone Dam in Kachin State, angering the project’s Chinese backers.Meanwhile, Union Minister U Khin Maung Soe ruled out coal being used to power the Thilawa special economic zone in Yangon Region.“We will have a 500 MW gas turbine instead ... we will be able to get enough gas by about 2015,” said U Khin Maung Soe.“We will not build power plants that have a bad effect on the environment. The head of the government also asked us to build hydropower and gas-powered plants instead,” he said.","/national-news/1252-govt-cuts-coal-plant-from-dawei-project.html"
"391",391,"China firms trade position in Myanmar",2012-01-16,"Business","Major infrastructure investments meant China was Myanmar’s major trading partner in the 2011-12 fiscal year through to December, a Ministry of Commerce official said last week.          In the 2011-12 fiscal year through to the end of December, bilateral trade amounted to about US$3.6 billion. Myanmar exported minerals, rubber, fruit and fisheries products worth about $1.6 billion and imported construction materials, machinery and consumer goods worth about $2 billion.Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) data shows that China invested about US$13.6 billion in Myanmar, most in the energy sector, in the 2010-11 financial year, including $9.6 billion in the 2011 calendar year.According to an MIC official, six official Chinese delegations visited MIC in 2011 to discuss investment in infrastructure, mining, energy and manufacturing.The Commerce official said that because Myanmar had imported much material from China to build infrastructure projects a trade deficit with that nation had developed.However, he expected that the balance of trade would reverse in coming months if Myanmar was able to export agriculture products.“Bilateral trade will continue to grow because China’s market is very big and the Myanmar government plans to open up new border trading zones in Kachin State in future,” he said.China and Myanmar trade mainly via the Muse 105-mile trading zone and Chinshwehaw in Shan State, as well as Lwejal and Kanpeiktee in Kachin State. Several other zones are closed as a result of armed conflict.The Commerce official said the Chinese market could easily absorb more of Myanmar’s exports if standards were improved.“China wants to boost imports of items such as flowers – we saw that during the border trade fair in Shweli in December. But to benefit from this we need to export more goods of a higher quality,” he said.“China has also asked us to open more border trading zones,” he said.In the previous fiscal year, China overtook Thailand to become Myanmar’s largest trading partner, with total trade estimated at about $5.2 billion.","/business/1210-china-firms-trade-position-in-myanmar.html"

However, the reform efforts appear to be working for now. Even the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which sits at 18 on the list of foreign investor nations in Myanmar with a total of US$41 million according to Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC), is exploring new opportunities in Myanmar.Al Marwan group of companies, a UAE-based firm that has examined Myanmar several times in the past 20 years, has decided to take the next step and is discussing potential investments with MIC officials, a company spokesperson said recently.“We have been here for many different projects and we have had to check how the government supports foreign investors. The rules and regulations [that govern foreign investment] are the most important consideration in determining how much money we put in,” Al Marwan general manager Mr Ziad Al-Attar told local media on December 27.He added that Myanmar has great potential because of its location and its large population, which provided both labour and a big potential market.Mr Ziad Al-Attar said the company would return to Yangon before January 31 to submit proposals to invest in and/or build highways, roads, bridges and hotels in Yangon and neighbouring areas. He added that the company is also interested in trading and marine services.In late November, MIC chairman and Minister for Industry U Soe Thein told media that “huge” foreign investment was likely to flow into the country, not only from regional countries, but also Western nations such as Norway, Sweden and several other EU members that have contacted MIC.Thailand is the second-largest foreign investor in Myanmar, especially in the oil and gas sector through PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), the overseas arm of its state-owned PTT energy firm. PTTEP is the operator of the Zawtika gas project in the Gulf of Mottama and a partner in the Yetagun and Yadana offshore gas projects.Thailand has invested about US$9 billion in energy, manufacturing and mining projects but other Thai investors are waiting for further reforms, said Mr Prajuab Supinee, the commercial counsellor at Thailand’s embassy.“Our investors are studying the new foreign investment law but we don’t think it’s totally different from the old one so they want to just wait and see,” he said.He added that new investors are interested in consumer goods manufacturing and agriculture ventures.China surpassed Thailand to become Myanmar’s largest foreign investor in the 2010-11 financial year when nearly $20 billion in assorted energy and infrastructure development projects were announced.Mr Nong Rong, vice secretary general of the China-ASEAN Expo Secretariat, said Chinese investors stand ready to support Myanmar and can draw on their more than 20 years of experience in China’s blossoming economy.He said that when China starting reforming its economy the majority of foreign investment centred on exporting the country’s natural resources. However, China is now an importer of many natural resources.“In the beginning [of the reform], Chinese people worried about the impact of the foreign investment because it was resources focused but later it changed to manufacturing,” he said.“Myanmar is similar to where China was 20 years ago,” he added.Mr Nong Rong said Chinese investors were targeting Myanmar’s underdeveloped infrastructure and construction sectors, as well as the manufacturing industry because of the abundant labour available.","/business/1290-continued-fdi-influx-depends-on-government-say-investors.html"

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Yangon said State Councillor Dai Bingguo would head the Chinese delegation to the December 19-20 summit, which will also bring together senior officials from Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. China has five state councillors, who rank below the country’s vice premiers but above government ministers. Mr Dai is the councillor for foreign affairs.News agency Reuters had reported on December 13 that Mr Wen was to attend the summit, in what would have been his first visit to Myanmar since President U Thein Sein took office in March.At a briefing in Beijing on December 15, however, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson confirmed Mr Wen would not travel to Nay Pyi Taw this week. The official summit website says the “leaders” of the six GMS countries were to participate in the summit, held every three years.Myanmar-China ties have been the subject of intense debate of late, partly as a result of the government’s improved relationship with the United States.Mr Renaud Egreteau from the University of Hong Kong said last week that while “some Chinese policy circles” have found the renewed US interest in Myanmar “quite disturbing”, Chinese officials knew that there was “a long way to go … before the US acquires the kind of strategic foothold commentators have recently argued they are aiming to regain”.“Beijing still enjoys a wide range of networks of influence in and around Myanmar, which other players, especially the US, do not. The [GMS] cooperation scheme is one of them, using diplomacy and economic cooperation has valuable channel for broader influence,” he told The Myanmar Times by email last week.Mr Egreteau said Myanmar’s leaders would attempt to carefully balance relations so the country did not become the centre of a rivalry between external powers, and this would continue to be the case as long as the military exerted an influence over policy-making.While Mr Wen will not be travelling to Myanmar, at least one foreign leader should be in Nay Pyi Taw this week: Thai newspaper The Nation reported that Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra would attend the summit, and would also hold sideline bilateral talks.Government officials declined to comment on the summit last week.

"394",394,"Despite reforms, Western oil firms avoid Myanmar",2011-12-05,"Business","Yangon – Myanmar’s reputation as one of the world’s most isolated and secretive states is changing rapidly but many foreign investors remain wary of exploring for oil or gas there, leaving the sector open to Indian, Thai and Malaysian firms.          Myanmar closed its biggest oil and gas exploration tender in years in August, a few months after it cautiously started political reforms, and the government is now processing the bids.Details of the tender are still trickling out but oil industry executives say Western oil companies were conspicuously absent, leaving regional firms as the main contenders.US firms are barred from new investments in Myanmar under government-ordered sanctions, but there were no expressions of interest from Europe. Some executives say the blocks on offer were not particularly lucrative.Chinese oil firms, historically dominant in Myanmar, appear lukewarm to the bidding for 18 onshore oil and gas blocks because of concerns over the blocks’ prospects. Additionally, bilateral ties have been strained since September, after Nay Pyi Taw shelved a China-backed dam in the north of the country.Industry sources in Myanmar said the tender had attracted about 50 bids, but further details were not available.“They probably have attracted as much as 50 bids, but each field may have been counted as a separate bid, so the number of individual companies bidding are very likely much lower than 50,” said H S Yen, a consultant at FACTS Global Energy.“They may have only attracted a single bid from a European company. I certainly don’t see a major company that isn’t already present in the country venturing into Myanmar given the risks of doing business there and the small reserves size.”So far only Thailand’s PTT Exploration and India’s ONGC Videsh have publicly expressed interest in this tender, with ONGC saying it is evaluating data. A senior official in Yangon has said Malaysia’s Petronas is among the bidders.Petronas said it has no comment on the matter at this point. The firm had said it has ongoing studies for unconventional oil in Myanmar.Japan’s Marubeni Corp also said it does not comment on individual auctions, while Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co declined to comment on anything related to bids.A Reuters survey of European and Asian firms showed that global majors such as Total SA, which already leads the US$1 billion Yadana gas project in Myanmar waters in the Gulf of Mottama, would not take part in the tender. “Total did not take part in the Myanmar bidding round,” its spokeswoman said.Christophe de Margerie, the French major’s chief executive officer, said in September that Total would like to play a bigger role in the Southeast Asian country but wanted to first see concrete signs of increased democratisation.“We decided that ... it was important to be in Myanmar but that we will not invest until things are getting better ... I do hope that will happen,” he said.Myanmar ushered in a civilian government in March after 49 years of harsh military rule, but many of its top leaders are former generals. Nevertheless, reforms picked up pace as authorities initiated talks with opposition icon Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, released prisoners of conscience and reached out to armed ethnic groups to end decades of violence.The moves were breathtakingly fast by Myanmar’s standards, and US President Barack Obama has said he has been encouraged. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Yangon last week to explore new ties, a major endorsement of the Myanmar government.But US officials have warned that sanctions will only be lifted after concrete and sustained signs of progress.Western oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell appear to be taking a similar tack. Sources said the major, which has plans to expand in Vietnam, is not eyeing Myanmar.Only one Western firm, Soco International, has recently signalled interest in Myanmar, though the British independent, which is producing oil off Vietnam, would not comment if it was bidding for licenses.“We are always looking to improve our exploration portfolio and Myanmar is a country that we think could offer opportunities,” said deputy chief executive Roger Cagle.Other Western firms such as Premier Oil Plc, which discovered the Yetagun gas field in 1992 but in 2002 sold its entire Myanmar business to Petronas, as well as Tullow Oil and Cairn Energy, said they did not take part in the tender.Russia’s Gazprom, which had been reported to have made enquiries about Myanmar’s upstream possibilities on a recent visit, declined to comment, though sources said they did not bid. Norway’s Statoil, Spain’s Repsol and Italy’s ENI also would not comment.China’s three big oil firms – Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corp and CNOOC – were also lukewarm toward the tender.CNOOC said it did not put in a bid, but there was no immediate word on whether the other two were involved.“We looked at the data packages for the tender. They didn’t look very promising,” said an executive familiar with Sinopec’s overseas investment. “The key is how good these blocks are for us to gauge if they are a profitable investment or not. The political factors are less important to us.”China’s big three oil firms are operating in Myanmar and by early 2007 held 13 exploration and production contracts, or about a third of those Myanmar has signed with foreign firms.“CNPC already has quite a few blocks there. The best assets of Myanmar are offshore, and mostly natural gas. Its onshore blocks are not so good. We did a lot of evaluation before,” said an industry adviser.Another executive said three deepsea contracts off Myanmar that CNPC signed in late 2006 proved much less valuable than expected. After completing minimal exploration works, CNPC pulled out part of its team there.Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise data showed Myanmar has 115 million barrels of onshore and 100 million barrels of offshore proven oil reserves. The proven onshore gas reserves are 400 billion cubic feet and offshore are 16 trillion cubic feet (TCF).BP Statistical Review figures showed that Myanmar’s proven gas reserves tripled in the past decade to around 800 billion cubic metres (28TCF), equivalent to more than a quarter of Australia’s.This compares with China’s proven oil reserves of 14.8 billion barrels, Malaysia’s 5.8 billion, Vietnam’s 4.4 billion and Indonesia’s 4.2 billion barrels, at the end of 2010, according to the BP Statistical Review.“These reserves, though modest by global standards, are enough to generate interest among regional economies. Myanmar is strategically located between China and India and is viewed as an important source of hydrocarbons for their growing energy requirements,” said Subramanya Bettadapura, Director, Energy & Power Systems, Asia Pacific, at Frost & Sullivan.China’s lack of interest this time and hopes for more liberal economic, fiscal and administrative policies as reforms continue could spur other Asian firms to venture into Myanmar.“Traditionally, China has had the inside track to these projects, but now the government wants to make the competition more open. So apart from the Chinese you could see the Indians, Thais and Malaysians involved,” said U Tin Maung Maung Than, Senior Fellow at the Institute of South East Asian Studies. – Reuters","/business/1537-despite-reforms-western-oil-firms-avoid-myanmar.html"
"395",395,"Myanmar officials call for more FDI",2011-10-31,"Business","Senior Myanmar officials attending the 8th China-ASEAN Expo in Nanning, China, last week urged potential investors to pay more attention to the nation’s underdeveloped manufacturing and service sectors.          U Aung Naing Oo, deputy director general of the Directorate of Investment and Company Registration under the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development, said during a seminar titled “Golden Land” that Myanmar had successfully attracted investment in other sectors but manufacturing and service had not seen the same interest.He said that of the US$36 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) contracted in Myanmar since the country opened up in 1988, 40 percent had been spent on electric power and 38pc on oil and gas, while manufacturing had attracted only 5pc and tourism 3pc. That investment had come from 450 companies from 31 countries, with China and Thailand the major investors, contributing 26.6pc and 26.5pc respectively.He added during the October 22 seminar that Myanmar offered attractive investment potential in agriculture, livestock, fisheries and many other services.The seminar attracted mostly Chinese listeners, who heard that China’s official investment in Myanmar was mostly put into power generation and oil and gas at 54pc and 31pc respectively, with a further 14pc in mining.Only 1pc was invested in manufacturing.At the end of the seminar, a listener asked what guarantees the government was able to offer potential investors in light of the recent suspension of the multi-billion-dollar Myitsone dam in Kachin that was to be built by state-backed China Power Investments Corporation.U Aung Naing Oo replied that the previous government had not considered public opinion when it granted approval for the project in 2006.But after the new nominally democratic government took over in March the public and environmentalists were able to make their opposition to the project known.He added that the suspension, announced on September 29, had also hurt Myanmar investors, both private and public.Minister for Commerce U Win Myint led another seminar on the same day during which he called for increased cooperation in the agriculture field, which would boost both sides.U Win Myint also said the expo was a platform for business cooperation that businesspeople from across ASEAN, including China, could access to help themselves make new contacts.Vice president of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry U Zaw Min Win said the newly elected government was doing what it could to attract investment.“It’s a good time to invest in many sectors. Myanmar has lots of resources and many different crops can be planted there that can be profitable for the investor and the country,” he said.He added that the country was preparing for the full implementation of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area in January 2015.Under that agreement China imposes zero tariffs on 91.5pc of products imported from ASEAN countries, with the average tariff rate down to 0.1pc for those that are taxed.The six original ASEAN countries have also implement zero tariffs on 90pc of Chinese commodities, with only 0.6pc tariffs charged on those products that are taxed. The four newer ASEAN members, including Myanmar, will achieve this goal in 2015.U Zaw Min Win told The Myanmar Times on October 23 that China would likely assist Myanmar’s automobile industry in future and was also keen to invest in solar energy and the processing of agricultural produce.","/business/1883-myanmar-officials-call-for-more-fdi.html"

Foreign Minister U Wunna Maung Lwin travelled to Beijing as a special envoy of President U Thein Sein and met with his Chinese counterpart, Mr Yang Jiechi, on October 10. China’s state news agency, Xinhua, reported that the pair agreed to “properly settle” the matter, increase bilateral cooperation and “work toward bringing mutual benefits to the two nations”.Later the same day, Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping told U Wunna Maung Lwin that “bilateral relations have been developing well” and “both sides should cherish the hard-earned good situation”, according to a statement from China’s Foreign Ministry.“Xi urged the two sides to properly settle relevant matters that have emerged during the course of cooperation through friendly consultations so as to ensure the healthy and stable development of China-Myanmar exchanges and cooperation in various fields,” the statement said.President U Thein Sein announced the suspension on September 30 following widespread criticism from activists and environmentalists. The decision provoked an angry response from Beijing and the president of state-owned China Power Investment Corporation, the main investor in the project, had threatened legal action.It was not clear last week whether a settlement had yet been reached and, if so, what compensation Myanmar would have to pay to China. The 6000-megawatt Myitsone dam was one of seven dams CPI was to build on the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwady River. Upon completion in 2019 it was expected to produce 29,400 million kilowatt hours a year, 90 percent of which would be exported to China.The website said CPI would continue work on six other dams it is constructing in Kachin State.U Ko Ko Hlaing, an adviser to President U Thein Sein on political affairs, told The Myanmar Times the government was legally obligated to follow contracts signed by the State Peace and Development Council.“The new government cannot neglect this [contract], according to the law. The new government has responsibility to solve this issue. In the president’s statement, [he said] both countries would continue with their friendly relations. On the other side, the government has a responsibility to respect the people’s desires and also the government has duty to fulfil the rights of the Chinese company.“In such a complicated situation, the government will have to solve this issue gently. I expected the government will find a suitable solution for all sides.”Dr Nicholas Farrelly, a Southeast Asia specialist at the Australian National University in Canberra and founder of the New Mandala website, said that while there would “inevitably” be some short-term damage to bilateral relations “pragmatism would override any potential for long-term animosity”.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who campaigned against the dam project on the grounds it could damage the environment and would harm national reconciliation efforts, said both sides needed to show respect for each other.“As neighbouring countries, we cannot live separately even if we don’t like each other. I want [Myanmar] to be okay with all the neighbouring countries,” she told reporters in Yangon on October 8. “I want both sides to solve the issue with mutual respect and open-mindedness.”– Additional reporting by Kyaw Hsu Mon and Thomas Kean","/national-news/1960-china-myanmar-close-in-on-agreement-to-settle-dispute-over-myitsone-suspension.html"
"397",397,"FDI must move beyond resources",2011-10-10,"Business","2010 was a record year for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Myanmar that saw almost US$20 billion pour into the country.          With 85 per cent of this investment in natural resources, and only 15pc allocated to the manufacturing and service industries, the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development stated on Spetember 29 that it hopes to encourage more FDI to manufacturing and service sectors.“About 85pc of investment in our country is based on resources, so we have to try to progress to other sectors such as manufacturing and services,” said U Aung Naing Oo the deputy director of National Planning.This official position echoes warnings from analysts who say that reliance on natural resources can prove detrimental for the economy as a whole.“[Investment in Myanmar] is based on natural resources and the environment, that’s not good for the long term obviously, they do not encourage development of the economy,” said economist U Han Htun who is also a columnist with Commerce Journal.At present, the majority of this investment in Myanmar comes from neighbouring countries and offers little in terms of technology transfer or job opportunities, with some investors bringing their own workers, even unskilled labours, he said.An official of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI) told The Myanmar Times that FDI is important to develop over the long-term, that the government needs to encourage investment into manufacturing to bring greater technology and job opportunities.The $20 billion in 2010 proved the exception to the mere millions of previous years; 2009-10 reached $329 million, while 2008-09 was $984 million, according to Central Statistical Organization (CSO) figures.However, the unprecedented levels of FDI in 2010 does not necessarily represent a trend.“The $20 billion in FDI last year reflected primarily a handful of megaprojects in the field of hydro-power. These are one-off projects unlikely to be repeated. Not in any sense a typical year,” Derek Tonkin, chairman of Network Myanmar and former British Ambassador to Thailand, told The Myanmar Times.Instead, the government needs to be more active in promoting FDI to help develop the economy as it seeks to integrate regionally and internationally, he said.“Myanmar has to compete with other investment destinations. It has some advantages over other ASEAN countries, but the main disincentive remains an unattractive investment environment which will not be resolved until there are substantial structural reforms.”The situation is still preoccupied with longstanding issues that have distracted from the need to focus on development.“Myanmar should already be competitive in basic industries like garments and footwear. But US sanctions, especially restrictions on the use of US dollars, need early resolution. Even so, Vietnam enjoyed several years of good growth in foreign investment even while US$ sanctions remained, until full normalisation of relations in July 1995.”Nevertheless, despite the fact that the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) has reported meeting foreign investors in various sectors a total of 24 times between July and September 2011, FDI slumped to a mere $14.5 million in the first three months of the 2011 fiscal year, according to CSO figures.Foreign investors are anticipating reforms to the foreign investment law to allow buying land as well as foreign currency account transfers, according to U Aung Naing Oo. Once these are finalised, he said, the Ministry for National Planning expects more FDI to come to Myanmar.But with the recent presidential decision to suspend the Chinese funded Myitsone Dam project in Kachin state, there are fears this could have an impact on potential future investments.“I doubt that the suspension will impact detrimentally on foreign investment generally,"" said Mr Tonkin.“What Myanmar needs are scores of small-to-medium sized manufacturing projects in the region of US$ 1 - 10 million rather than a handful of megaprojects which have a habit of running into problems which are difficult to resolve,” he said.Nevertheless, the Ministry of Energy continues to invite foreign investment in oil and gas, with 18 onshore oilfields offered in July.“If we search onshore oilfields ourselves we have to invest hundreds of millions and require specific technology,” the Ministry of Energy Union Minister U Than Htay told local media.“So we have to think, should we import oil for many years or invite investors with our agreement. The government allowed us, so we corporate with them,” he said.","/business/1928-fdi-must-move-beyond-resources.html"

"399",399,"Despite protest, minister vows govt will continue dam project",2011-09-19,"National News","The emotional debate over hydropower projects on the Ayeyarwady River shows no signs of abating, with the Minister for Electric Power 1 declaring last week that the government would “never give up” on the project.          A strong opposition movement has arisen in response to the project, particularly a dam at the confluence of the Maykha and Malikha rivers in Kachin State.However, Union Minister U Zaw Min said the government had no intention of caving in to pressure from activists.“Some media say we will retreat because environmental organisations are protesting but we won’t give up on it, this project is needed for our national economy to get electric power,” he said at a press conference on September 11.“Some organisations are trying to sidetrack the project with environmental reasons but it is so clear they are just trying to block our country’s economy.We don’t need to listen to the comments of those groups; we just do our job for the 50 million people of Myanmar.” The ministry signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China Power Investment Corporation on December 28, 2006. Under the project, the Chinese company will build seven dams on the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwady collectively capable of generating more than 13,000MW.The largest – and most controversial – of the dams will be at the confluence of the Maykha and Malikha rivers, in the area known as Myitsone. U Zaw Min said that Myanmar would get 10 percent of electricity generated free of charge and would own 15pc of the project without investing anything.He said the government would also charge withholding tax on the project, which was on track to be completed in eight years. “Some media say these [projects] are only profiting China. But this is the only way we can implement these projects because our country does not have the money.If we had the money, we would do it ourselves,” he said. He said the government had paid local non-government organisation Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association (BANCA) US$1.25 million to conduct an environmental assessment. While conceding that the assessment found the dam would have some negative impact on the environment and local residents, he said the “huge” benefits of the project outweighed these issues.“We need to think which is bigger, the damage to the environment or benefits to our country. We are doing this project because the benefits are bigger than the anticipated damage to the environment,” he said. He said the dam would consume about 7pc of the river’s water supply, while 93pc would continue to flow normally.He also revealed that he had written an article published in state media in August titled “We also love the Ayeyarwady” and said he would speak further about the project on September 17.“This [Ayeyarwady] river is beginning to get degraded because nobody has maintained it, the river is not flowing steadily. Nobody maintained it because there is a lack of wealth, power and interest in the river,” U Zaw Min said.“We shouldn’t say this river will die. Instead, we should just say how we will maintain it.” Both the substance and the tone of U Zaw Min’s comments incensed environmental activists, who again called on the government to reconsider the project.“The Maykha-Malikha confluence is the birthplace of the Ayeyarwady. This place is like our mother: a mother takes care of us and feeds us and the Ayeyarwady supports the livelihoods of many people from its upper reaches to the lower delta. To me it feels like if they go ahead with this project, they are destroying our mother.Even if they pass an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), they should not implement the project,” said Daw Daewi Thant Sin, an environmental activist and chief editor of monthly magazine Aung Pin Lae.“The new government has so far accepted all the things that were [initiated] by the former government, regardless of whether they were good or bad … but it needs to think thoroughly whether this project is good or bad. The previous government was a military government, so it was not unusual that they never announced what they were doing.But our country is changing to a parliamentary democracy, and the government should listen to the voice of the public.” “I am very disappointed at these comments from such a high-ranking official. It is very unexpected … the way he talked, it looked like a dictatorship. He is just continuing to do whatever he wants in spite of the widespread public criticism,” said photographer Ko Myint Zaw, who earlier this year held an exhibition titled “Watershed of Ayeyarwady”. “I think this project could damage the watershed of the Maykha and Malikha rivers, which are the sources of the Ayeyarwady River. We need to conserve the watershed so the river doesn’t disappear.I think upper-level officials already know this.” Previously an environmental issue, the dam project has takne on a political dimension that some believe could tarnish the image of the new government. “This project should be postponed,” said U Khin Maung Swe, co-founder of the National Democratic Force.“Even if we urgently have to implement this project to meet our electricity needs … the government should discontinue it and find another more suitable site somewhere else.” “Many people are worried about the environmental consequences, which could potentially affect a large proportion of the population. Experts say salt water could intrude more and more into the Ayeyarwady delta and more sandbanks will form [as a result of the project]. “If this occurs, it will have a negative impact on the agricultural sector and that would certainly not be in the national interest.”","/national-news/2196-despite-protest-minister-vows-govt-will-continue-dam-project.html"
"400",400,"India looks to reset ties with Myanmar ",2011-06-27,"National News","India stands ready to share its experience of parliamentary democracy with Myanmar, the country’s foreign minister, Mr S M Krishna, told President U Thein Sein and other senior members of the government last week.          A statement released by the Indian embassy in Yangon following Mr Krishna’s three-day visit, which ended on June 22, said the external affairs minister also relayed his government’s “support for the cause of national reconciliation and democratic progress in an inclusive manner”.“He also informed that India stands ready to share its wealth of experience in parliamentary democracy through exchange of parliamentary delegations [and] training,” the statement said.The visit was the first by a senior Indian official since Myanmar’s new government was sworn in on March 30. Mr Krishna, who was accompanied by foreign secretary Ms Nirupama Rao, met President U Thein Sein, Vice President Thiha Thura U Tin Aung Myint Oo, the speakers of the national legislatures, Foreign Affairs Minister U Wunna Maung Lwin and Minister for Electric Power 1 U Zaw Min in Nay Pyi Taw.The statement said talks focused on “matters of bilateral and regional importance”, including exchange of visits, security and neighbourly ties, trade and economic cooperation, cooperation in developmental projects, agriculture, energy, health, education and training.Mr Krishna also handed over ownership of 10 500-tonne rice silos collectively valued at US$2 million, which have been constructed in Yangon and Ayeyarwady regions, and provided $750,000 for the reconstruction of seven schools destroyed in the Tarlay earthquake in March.However, just one memorandum of understanding was signed – for an Indo-Myanmar training centre based at Myingyan in Mandalay Region – and the visit took place against a backdrop of growing economic and political ties between Myanmar and China.In the 2010-11 fiscal year China overtook Thailand to be Myanmar’s largest trade partner and source of foreign investment, pledging almost $14 billion for a raft of energy projects.Dr Marie Lall, a South Asia analyst based at the University of London, said China had been able to gain the ascendancy in Myanmar because of “a lack of common vision” among different ministries that make up the Indian government.Little progress had been made on major agreements signed in early 2009 and India was “uncomfortable to see so much Chinese influence in Myanmar”, particularly in the Bay of Bengal.“I suspect that India’s foreign minister is visiting in order to see how the agreements can be moved forward. I also believe that it is India’s aim to establish closer links with the new government and to see how much structural change has actually taken place,” she said.One project on which India has failed to make progress is the $3 billion, 1200 megawatt Tamanthi hydropower plant in Sagaing Region, which is being constructed by India’s National Hydroelectric Power Corporation. The likelihood of the dam not being completed on time reportedly prompted the Indian ambassador to Myanmar to suggest the project be aborted rather than go ahead and harm the image of Indian companies but many see it as vital to India’s interests here.In a recent commentary, the New Delhi-based Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses called on the Indian government to “press ahead” with the project “in order to enhance its economic and strategic reach in the East”.“The Tamanthi dam should not be perceived as a project meant for mere generation of electricity,” researcher Shivananda H wrote in the June 15 piece. “It has many strategic implications for India both from economic and security perspectives in enhancing the bilateral relationship with Myanmar.”Dr Lall agreed the Tamanthi project was “vital” and said it was “India’s challenge to establish closer ties with the new Myanmar government”.","/national-news/2550-india-looks-to-reset-ties-with-myanmar.html"
"401",401,"Foreign investment floods into Myanmar",2011-06-27,"In Depth","Foreign investment hit unprecedented levels in the 2010-11 financial year while the strengthening local currency and domestic construction projects narrowed the balance of trade, figures from the Central Statistical Organisation show.          Yet it was Myanmar’s growing economic relationship with China that was borne out most in the figures for the past fiscal year. The northern neighbour leapfrogged Thailand to become both the largest foreign investor here and most significant trade partner – further confirmation of China’s growing influence, in case there was any doubt.Mainland China and Hong Kong were the source of US$14.07 billion of the almost $20 billion in new investment pledged from April 1 to March 31. The oil and gas, electric power and mining sectors were the main recipients, while smaller amounts were committed for agriculture and manufacturing projects.Bilateral trade with mainland China rose 80 percent to $3.37 billion, while trade with Hong Kong – almost exclusively exports – doubled to $1.91 billion. Thailand was the second largest trade partner at $3.61 billion.Income from exports rose 20 percent, from US$7.57 billion to $9.01 billion, largely on the back of exports to China and Hong Kong, most likely jade. Earnings from natural gas sales to Thailand – once again the country’s most profitable export item – fell from $2.91 billion in 2009-10 to $2.52 billion.However, Myanmar’s trade surplus declined significantly as imports rose more than 50pc year-on-year to $6.40 billion.The largest single import item was refined fuel ($1.39 billion, up 106pc) followed by machinery and transport equipment ($1.20 billion, up 33pc) and base metals and manufactures ($553 million, up 51pc).Construction remains a major engine of the economy, as the Asian Development Bank noted recently.“[E]conomic growth edged up to an estimated 5.3pc in the 2010-11 fiscal year, with a solid contribution from construction, particularly in Nay Pyi Taw … and Mandalay,” the bank said in its Asian Development Outlook report.“As major foreign investment projects – including hydropower plants, gas fields and an oil and gas pipeline to southern China – get further underway, construction is likely to have an even larger impact, pushing growth up to 5.5pc over the next two years.”The balance of trade is likely to narrow further, the ADB said, with “increases in export earnings from gas and food crops … offset by stronger imports of capital equipment and construction materials”.There are also signs of the effect the strengthening local currency is having on the economy, and the factors in its appreciation, such as foreign investment.However, much of the pledged foreign investment will not yet have entered the economy because of the delay between signing off on a project and implementing it. The $20 billion figure is not representative of actual foreign investment inflows, said Mr Derek Tonkin, chairman of Network Myanmar. Rather, they offer “a very rough guide to contracted investment”, he said. “The completed contracts have just hit the statistics at this particular time.”Nevertheless, he said “the bulk” of the contracted investment was likely to be realised in the coming years because the investors are Chinese state-owned firms, which are less vulnerable to economic downturns than private companies.While Myanmar might not experience levels of investment as high as 2010-11 again, contracted FDI is also unlikely to dip below $1 billion in coming years. This is, at least in part, due to the promulgation of Special Economic Zone (SEZ) laws: The Dawei SEZ alone is potentially a $50 billion project, with $8 billion under the first 10-year phase.One local expert said the target sectors of investment were likely to diversify from extractive industries but unless sanctions were lifted, the source countries would be almost exclusively Asian. If some of the barriers to foreign investment are removed, such as difficulties remitting profits and the multiple exchange rates, the investment “flood” of 2011-12 could in hindsight look like a trickle.Another factor in the kyat’s appreciation has been the government’s policy of issuing bonds to make up for the budget deficit, which the ADB estimated at 5.7pc of GDP in 2010-11. The government issued more than K300 billion in new five-year bonds in the past financial year, taking total outstanding bonds to K490.5 billion. The overwhelming majority is in the hands of private entities and it’s probably no coincidence that a spike in sales occurred shortly before four new private banks opened in August 2010.As The Myanmar Times reported last week, the strong currency has made many export items temporarily unprofitable, particularly those that can be sold domestically where prices are still strong. This is reflected in Customs data that shows 8.5 million tonnes of cargo entered the country’s ports, an increase of 23pc. However, less than 3.3 million tonnes headed the other way, down 28pc on the previous year.The one bright spot for exporters appears to be garments, which bucked the trend. After remaining mostly steady for the past few years at $280 million, exports bounced one-third to $378 million.","/in-depth/2523-foreign-investment-floods-into-myanmar.html"

Managing director of Mundaing Real Estate, U Than Oo, said the nation’s property sector would be one of the first to benefit from any lift in foreign direct investment (FDI) as a result of the January 27 Special Economic Zone law’s enactment.“When foreign investment enters Myanmar and spurs economic growth, it will drag the property market with it,” he said.He said property is the most popular investment now – far outweighing gold, jewellery or cars – and added that he didn’t believe investors could possibly lose their money in the market.U Zaw Zaw, the manager of Unity Real Estate, predicted that prices could easily climb another 20 percent.“Right now the market is moving so quickly that people can invest and make quick gains. It shows that property investment is the most lucrative option for those with the capital,” he added.However, he said he was unable to comment on the value of land prices in Yangon compared to nearby cities that are popular with international investors such as Bangkok or Singapore, adding that foreigners are still not allowed to own property here.“The most lucrative sites are along the main roads, with prices in key commercial areas along Sule Pagoda Road, Anawrahta and Mahabandoola streets in Yangon ranging from K1 million to K1.5 million a square foot.”Barely three years ago, the same sites were worth only K450,000 at most.U La Wun Tun, the manager of Asia Land Real Estate, said the rise in prices has been “amazing”.“Prices in prime locations have gone up and up – it’s just amazing. Some commercial locations are K1 million a square foot, while prime sites along Sule Pagoda Road or Anawrahta Street are selling for even more than that.”Real estate agents said they had expected a post-election lull but sales have gained pace ever since the start of Chinese New Year on February 3.– Translated by Thiri Min Htun","/business/property-news/3320-commercial-property-prices-hit-amazing-highs-agents.html"
"403",403,"Prices surge as speculators flock to Dawei",2011-02-21,"Business","A storm of speculation has driven property prices in Dawei, in Tanintharyi Region, sky-high after plans emerged to build a super seaport and special economic zone there.          The boom, which has pushed up prices to levels rivaling those of Pyay Road, Yangon, began after the long-term, multibillion development plans were announced last October, say local real estate agents. In some cases, prices have now risen to 10 times what they were in September.Italian-Thai Development, the company developing the 250-square-kilometre site, is said to have already begun planning a 160-kilometre-long road to Kanchanaburi Province in Thailand to encourage further foreign investment. The company signed a 60-year build, operate and transfer agreement with the government on November 2. The enormous project has an expected price tag of US$58 billion.Most buying has been concentrated in Dawei’s downtown streets and the orchards that lie between the town and the site of the proposed deepsea port at Kappali Bay, the sources said.The buyers are said to be Myanmar of Chinese extraction from Kachin State and Mandalay who, apparently working together with some local residents, bought about four or five blocks at the same time in the same place, said U Soe Thein, the owner of Soe Thein Real Estate.One Chinese buyer bought eight blocks on Seventh Street for K4.5 million each, he said.Until then, sales in the area had been stagnant. “Nobody wanted to buy before, but he said he was buying because of his traditional beliefs,” he said.The price of those blocks then rose to K10 million, and eventually local residents bought it back from the original buyer for K12-13 million in the hope of further profits from resale to investors, said U Soe Thein.A Dawei District official said, “It isn’t locals who are buying. It’s speculators with an eye to the future.”A prime location in the town centre, near the supermarket, hotels and offices, jumped from K100,000 to about K500,000 a square foot, comparable to Pyay Road in Yangon.“I heard the owners have locked in the price now, because they know they cannot get that place again at that price,” he said.Some residents dare not sell, fearing the rapid escalation of prices would prevent them from buying another property, sources in Dawei said.About 4 acres of orchard land went for K30 million three months ago, but now a Yangon buyer is offering K100 million – but the owner refuses to sell, said Daw Aye Nwe, who owns a pomelo orchard between Dawei and Maungmakan beach.“This orchard represents our family’s livelihood, and we can’t sell,” she said.Nearby rubber farms have also appreciated in value by about 50 percent, to K17 million for two acres, said Ko Than Htwe, the owner of a rubber farm near Maungmakan. The beach there is expected to be developed into a tourist attraction about 10 miles (16km) from the seaport complex. A 400-square-foot restaurant there changed hands this month for K3 million, when the owner said the site had been valued at only K300,000 in October last year.A group of ethnic Chinese people from Kachin and the Chinese border appeared in Dawei shortly after the New Year, and are now looking into orchard and farming compounds around the future port, said one local property investor who is holding two or three blocks on the main road.","/business/3392-prices-surge-as-speculators-flock-to-dawei.html"
"404",404,"Tourism industry optimistic after record-breaking year ",2011-01-17,"National News","Following a record-breaking year for the tourism sector that saw Myanmar welcome almost 300,000 foreign visitors, industry leaders say they are anticipating an even stronger 2011. Figures from the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism show that 295,174 foreign tourists passed through the Yangon gateway, a 29.8 percent increase on 2009. The 227,421 visitors recorded that year represen-ted a 17.6pc increase on 2008.          “2010 was a record year for Myanmar tourism industry, with the numbers of arrivals beating … our previous record year in 2006,” said Daw Su Su Tin, managing director of Exotissimo Travel in Yangon. “And I believe 2011 will be another record year because reservations are already much better than last year. I’m expecting arrivals will be up 30pc.”With 198,040, or 67pc of total visitors, Asia was once again the leading region of origin for foreign tourists. The 59,010 from Thailand represented the largest total for a single country, followed by China with 32,757.The largest group for European visitors was from France, with 13,102, followed by Germany with 10,932 and the United Kingdom with 7195.Myanmar Marketing Committee chairman Dr Aung Myat Kyaw said industry stakeholders were “very optimistic” about the prospects for 2011.“We look forward to having a new political system that will be tourism friendly … it is a long-awaited change,” he said last week. “We are not only looking forward to expanding the markets that always existed in Myanmar – as a cultural or natural destination, a destination for ‘travellers’ – but also to become a ‘holiday’ destination.”“If the visa-on-arrival system was re-introduced it would open Myanmar up to last-minute travel and weekend travellers and we would definitely see an increase in the number of tourist arrivals,” he said, before declaring: “For Myanmar, 2011 will be an exciting year.”Independent travellers, known in the industry as Foreign Individual Travellers (FIT), made up the majority of the increase in overall arrivals, increasing 49.3pc to 173,043.There were more modest rises among other categories of travellers, with 21,996 arriving on package tours, 48,557 on business visas and 28,240 with social visas.The rapid growth in tourist arrivals has not been matched by investment in infrastructure and some experts are predicting that the industry will struggle to cope with demand in the coming 12 months.“With the expected increase in arrivals the biggest challenge in 2011 for us will be to cope with the shortage of tourism infrastructure in Myanmar, namely accommodation, seats on domestic flights, transportation and, most of all, tour guides,” said MMC vice chairman U Phyoe Wai Yar Zar.“We need to concentrate on capacity-building programs so that our industry can be on par or even better than our competitors in the region,” he said.Mr Frank Janmaat, general manager of Inya Lake Hotel, agreed that maintaining a high level of service could be problematic given “a large increase” in foreign arrivals was anticipated.“There is no reason why a country like Myanmar should receive five times less visitors than, for instance, Laos. The biggest challenge will be to cope with the increasing number of tourist as far as infrastructure, commun-ications and preserving the unique national identity is concerned,” Mr Janmaat said.“I think that the elections have also brought a lot of positive publicity to the country after the negative reports from the internat-ional press that Myanmar has so undeservedly received over the past couple of years.”For its part, the ministry plans to promote Myanmar further at international trade shows. A spokesperson said the ministry also plans to facilitate smoother travel by relaxing visa procedures both in Yangon and at border entry points, such as Tachileik-Mae Sai on the border with Thailand and Muse-Ruili on the Chinese border. The ministry has increased cooperation with regional organisations, namely ASEAN and its dialogue partners, the spokesperson said.And, it seems, the world is taking notice. On January 11, Luxury Travel Magazine named Myanmar in its “Top 11 Luxury Travel Trends for 2011”, alongside Sri Lanka and Brazil, and declared it “wide open for tourism”.","/national-news/4345-tourism-industry-optimistic-after-record-breaking-year.html"

On November 30, Myanmar signed a US$2.4 billion loan disbursement cooperation with China in Nay Pyi Taw.The agreement was made between Myanmar Foreign Investment bank and the China Development Bank Corporation (CDBC). The loan is mainly for investment in the China-Myanmar gas pipeline, which runs from Rakhine’s Kyauk Phyu township to China’s Yunnan province, said Mr Jin Honggen, economic and commercial counselor of the Chinese embassy in Yangon.“The loan will be mainly for the natural gas project in Kyauk Phyu, which involves Myanmar, China, Korea and India, where Myanmar has 7.3 percent of the shares. Part of the loan is provided for Myanmar as an investment in the project,” said Mr Jin.He did not reveal further details of the loan disbursement, but said the loan would help bring the project to speedy completion, besides providing foreign investment funds for Myanmar and energy for Yunnan province.“The natural gas from Myanmar will be used for Yunnan province’s industrial requirements and for residential use,” said Mr Jin, adding that the project offered advantages to both countries.He said the other part of the loan would be used in different projects, where the officials concerned would provide further details.“Looking back over the past three decades, China’s development has been considerable, and we would like our neighbours, especially Myanmar, to develop more,” he said, adding that a certain amount of development was already apparent in Yangon, Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw.“We can see that there are many supermarkets appearing in the cities with lots of customers, which is one sign of development the Chinese embassy is happy to see,” said Mr Jin.He added that Chinese investment in Myanmar had increased over the past few years, indicating good cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese embassy was urging Chinese investors to come to Myanmar, he said.Dr Maung Aung, an economist, said the Chinese investment funds should be used to strengthen infrastructure, seeing that Myanmar did not receive much official development aid from foreign countries.“If the loan is used effectively for the long-term infrastructure development of the country, it would be very effective for Myanmar,” said Dr Maung Aung.Myanmar at present produces more than 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day (mmcfd) from its two offshore projects in the Gulf of Mottama. According to government figures, Myanmar is one of the leading producers of natural gas via pipeline in the Asia-Pacific region, and the 11th largest exporter worldwide. Of the two offshore fields, Yadana produces 700 mmcfd, while Yetagun produces 400 mmcfd.PTTEP – a Thai gas company operating in Myanmar since 1998 – buys more than 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day from Yadana and Yetaugun.The country has earned more than $2 billion from exporting natural gas to Thailand, and earnings from gas sales will increase when new projects start producing over next three years.","/business/4457-massive-loan-from-china-to-fund-gas-investment.html"
"407",407,"Yangon rail line to start soon: Chinese official ",2010-11-29,"Business","Work on a high-speed rail line linking Yangon to China’s Yunnan province, as well as Cambodia, Thailand and Laos, is expected to start within two months, China Daily newspaper reported on November 21.          Should the plan come to fruition, the 1920-kilometre (1200 miles) Yunnan-Yangon line will be able to carry trains travelling at up to 240 kilometres an hour (km/h).China scholars told The Hindu newspaper that the lines were part of a wider effort to deepen engagement with its Southeast Asian neighbours, officials said last week. According to Wang Mengshu, a consultant for the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said studies are also being conducted to link Yunnan’s capital – Kunming – with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. In August, the Ministry of Railways also sent a team to Thailand to explore investing in a US$25.6-billion, 240km/h high-speed railway and rail network.Mr Wang, who is a professor with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told The Hindu in an interview earlier this year that construction had already begun on a line connecting Kunming with Singapore. The Southeast Asian network, he said, could be completed as early as 2020. Beijing’s increased infrastructure investment in Southeast Asia, analysts say, is part of a larger effort to expand economic and strategic influence in the region. Beijing hopes the investment will also ease anxieties among its ASEAN neighbours over the impact of China’s rising economic influence.China ratified the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) pact with the regional bloc but in the process has created a fast-widening trade imbalance in its favour, in part fuelled by the flooding of the ASEAN market with Chinese goods. This has led to strains in commercial relationships with many ASEAN countries. The trade deficit grew to $21.6 billion last year. A number of countries have also voiced concern over the pattern of Chinese investments, which have generally targeted resources such as oil and minerals.One concern for China is how it will recoup its vast investments in projects such as the high-speed rail lines. “There is no technological barrier to building high-speed railways to Southeast Asian countries but China needs to take profitability into account,” Ji Jialun, a professor at the Beijing Jiaotong University, told the China Daily.One proposal that has been mooted by China’s Ministry of Railways calls for equivalent access to resources in countries where China invests in such projects.The national network will reach 120,000km by 2020, and 60 percent of the railway lines will be located in China’s western regions, which have historically lagged the coastal east on most development indicators.Dr Maung Maung Lay, general secretary of Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI), said the plan to link China with Myanmar by rail offered exciting transport possibilities.“Trains are the most convenient transportation method for moving commodities between China and Myanmar. It’s much cheaper than road or air and I would imagine that this would also help China to increase the number of seaports it can access,” he said.“But it would also make transporting goods from Myanmar to Yunnan far easier, and Yunnan is the end destination for many of the country’s exports.” – Kyaw Hsu Mon and Agencies","/business/4525-yangon-rail-line-to-start-soon-chinese-official.html"
"408",408,"Still looking for an answer",2010-10-18,"National News","My friends tell me I’m stupid. And maybe they’re right. I don’t know the answer yet. I came back to this country in May 2009 after spending more than two years studying public administration in the United States, at Boston’s Suffolk University.          I went to the US to get access to an international education, but now it’s great to be back in Yangon, the city I grew up in. It’s good to meet up with former colleagues, friends, old school pals and so on, and to talk with them just like the old days.My family is not rich. I was able to study in America because I was lucky enough to get a scholarship to cover my expenses. I also had the idea that, in receiving an expensive foreign education, I was not only improving myself, but also increasing my chances of working for the people of Myanmar – putting my abilities and training to work for their benefit.But when my friends congratulate me, they are quick to add: “So why did you come back? Why didn’t you stay there and work? Are you nuts?” I’m getting a bit tired of arguing with them.I’ve heard that most people educated abroad who then come back here get the same reaction, and sometimes I try to duck the subject altogether to avoid the inevitable criticism.Of course, I could talk about my duty to my family, my loyalty to my country, and the need to fulfil my commitment to the people of Myanmar. You’d think people would understand this without being told.But I also feel that the answer lies somewhere else. And sometimes I dream of proving my friends wrong, maybe by getting a high-paying job, going into business, buying property and driving an expensive car, or becoming a celebrity.Then, one day, I remembered a conversation I had with a college friend at Suffolk University’s wonderful Moakley Law Library, which houses thousands of rare books, some of them centuries old. He asked me, “Where does the wealth of the state lie?” I started talking about GDP, per capita income, “soft” power and so on, but he stopped me by pointing to the books around us. The true wealth of a country lies in its intellectual property, the intelligence of its people.Contemplating this conversation, I came to realise that that should be my response to the criticism of my colleagues, friends and others. We are the brains of the country, and the true source of its wealth. We have a duty to pass on to our fellow-citizens the benefits of our education.Now I teach economic policy and public policy at a public service school here in Yangon. I see it as a vital bridge for the development of the country in the age of information, using our understanding of the global economy. Without such a bridge, we can’t go forward into the future. Maybe my friends don’t like to see me struggling in this way. But I think it’s the best thing I can do for my people.Look how China offers economic incentives to encourage its citizens to go to the West to study – and then to return and work for the improvement of their country and their people. The Chinese government recognises the importance of building an educated corps of citizens.I was thinking of this the other day on the bus, as the conductor shouted at me and the other passengers to squeeze up and make way for a fresh wave of commuters climbing aboard. You know how it is in Yangon during rush hour. Maybe it’s like that in China too, even for people with a Western education.When you have to face problems like getting on and off a crowded bus every day, it’s easy to think my friends are right. But when I think of the wealth and power of the United States, and of China, and the way China is developing its future, I start to see that I’m doing the right thing in putting my investment to work in my own country. It will be a slow process, and my friends might not be convinced. But maybe one day they will see.","/national-news/4757-still-looking-for-an-answer.html"
"409",409,"Real estate sector hopes for introduction of home loans",2010-10-11,"Business","The recent opening of new private banks has spurred speculation that home buyers will eventually be able to take out a mortgage, a common practice in countries with a more highly developed financial sector.          But nobody is expecting this to happen any time soon, real estate sources said.“The government offers companies loans for industrial investment and expansion, but no loans are available for cars or homes. If a mortgage system were introduced, we would have to review our regulations,” said U Pe Myint, managing director of the Cooperative Bank.The possibility has arisen because the financial sector in Myanmar is controlled by the Central Bank, and the new government to emerge from next month’s election could therefore affect policy.One factor that could influence the authorities is the continuing fallout from the global financial crisis of 2008. Though Myanmar, having no significant financial sector, escaped the immediate effects, it has suffered like most other countries from the subsequent recession.“In China, there are many buildings for sale, but no buyers. Since these buildings were funded by bank loans, the developers have to surrender them to the banks when they cannot repay the loans. The bankruptcies in the United States occurred for similar reasons. We have to take this into account before making a decision,” said U Pe Myint.Real estate agents see a boost for their business if banks are able to give long-term home loans, which would stimulate spending.“Banks should give long-term loans. It could help the real estate sector a lot,” said one agent from Mingalar Taung Nyunt township.“Agencies suffered from the bank collapse in Myanmar in 2003 because loans were handed out without any conditions or controls,” he added. But proper financial policy and management could generate funds for construction and new business, he predicted.“Chinese banks are continuing to lend despite the financial crisis in the US and Europe. Banks should lend money for housing as well as industrial development. Then demand will increase and the property sector will develop,” he said.Strong financial flows and increasing demand for homes could also strengthen the middle class, he said.“More homes will be built and sold on contract, and the number of unsold homes or abandoned construction sites will fall,” said an agent in Kyauktada township.“A mortgage system is the key way of improving access to the housing market. Banks should lend to buyers as well as builders so that people with a regular income can buy homes,” said one construction company businessman.According to Dr Maung Maung Lay, general secretary of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, bank loans for borrowers with a regular income could benefit all parties.“Provided banks are careful only to lend to people with a regular income who can repay the loan, property values could increase,” he added. – Translated by Thiri Min Htun","/business/4798-real-estate-sector-hopes-for-introduction-of-home-loans.html"

U Aye Lwin, executive committee member of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI), is leading a group of 30 officials, and will use the forum to deliver a presentation on mining exports and the level of investment in the sector.U Aye Lwin said the goal of the presentation is to encourage further foreign investment in the mining industry.“We hope that foreign companies will invest in our mining sector. Their investment would provide high quality mining technology and equipment,” he said.U Aye Lwin added that Myanmar is eager to attract mining investment from any country, not just from ASEAN members.CABIS will be held in Nanning, China, from September 6 to 7, and the body has sponsored 15 exhibition booths at a cost of US$550 each for the Mining Cooperation Forum.U Aye Lwin said that the Myanmar Traders Association, which is under the UMFCCI, was contacted by CABIS about running a booth in mid-July.In addition to delivering a presentation, the Myanmar delegation has arranged for a tour of the Chinese mining industry.The UMFCCI believes Myanmar’s mining sector has significant development potential due to its rich deposits of gems, nickel, lead and copper. According to UMFCCI statistics, by the close of 2009 roughly 60 foreign countries had invested almost US$1.4 billion in Myanmar’s mining industry.","/business/4959-myanmar-to-take-part-in-cabis-mining-forum.html"

CAEXPO Vice Secretary General Nong Rong talked to The Myanmar Times about the opportunities on offer for Myanmar companies at the expo and the growing trade between the two countries.          This is the seventh CAEXPO. Has Myanmar been well represented in the past?Myanmar has been at all six expos and chartered an independent exhibition hall in the Pavilion of Commodity Trade at the last three. It has hosted 494 booths over that time and 1520 exhibitors and trade visitors from Myanmar have attended, signing trade deals worth US$43.648 million. With support from the governments of the two countries, CAEXPO will continue to provide opportunities for Myanmar enterprises to explore international markets.Are any changes planned for this year?As the first expo after the establishment of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area (CAFTA), the event is of great significance and presents new highlights. To maintain its high profile, the 7th CAEXPO will be held concurrently with the China-ASEAN FTA Achievement Exhibition to promote China-ASEAN cooperation. We are also adding four new pavilions in line with relevant agreements under the China-ASEAN FTA, such as the Pavilion of Trade in Services, which focuses on financial services, logistics services and educational exchange services. There will also be specialised exhibition sections like a jewellery section and an ASEAN brands section. We will also hold a series of high-end forums on the theme of CAFTA and new opportunities to expand bilateral cooperation in various fields.CAFTA came into effect on January 1, with Myanmar committing to scrap tariffs on 90 pc of goods traded with China by 2015. What impact has the FTA had so far?Chinese statistics for the first four months of this year show bilateral trade with ASEAN countries grew 76.8pc compared to the same period last year to US$1.32 billion. Myanmar’s exports to China soared by 72.4pc while imports from China increased 79pc [no figures were given], showing the effect of the FTA has been equal for the two countries. The FTA has also increased two-way investment in the region and Myanmar is an important destination for Chinese investment.The signing of the China-ASEAN FTA Agreement on Trade in Services and Investment Agreement will open the services sector in both countries and provide a more stable and transparent investment environment. ASEAN is now the 5th largest export market and import source of services for China and Myanmar, being an important ASEAN member, boasts huge potential for cooperating with China on trade in goods and services and investment.How are preparations going for Myanmar exhibitors?Myanmar’s Ministry of Commerce, a CAEXPO co-sponsor, is organising enterprises to bring their cutting-edge products to the event. Myanmar will have 96 commodity booths, the same as last year, and an exhibition area to promote Mandalay, your City of Charm. Officials from your investment authority will also attend to attract more Chinese investment. The Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Myanmar Forest Products & Timber Merchants Association, the Beans & Sesame Seeds Merchants Association, Myanmar Pulses, Myanmar Agro Based Food Processors & Exporters Association, the Myanmar Fisheries Federation and the Myanmar Industries Association have all agreed to bring their member enterprises and support us in promoting the event to develop trade.","/business/5104-china-calling.html"
"414",414,"Garment factories hindered in new recruitment drive",2010-06-14,"Business","Labour recruitment in the garment is rising sharply, an industry source said last week.          U Myint Soe, president of Myanmar Garment Manufacturers’ Association, said two factors were driving the employment upswing – an increase in orders from garment buyers abroad, particularly South Korea, and new factories started up by Chinese and Vietnamese companies. “These are creating demand for new workers,” said U Myint Soe.U Than Ye, operations manager for a South Korean-owned garment factory at the Dagon Industrial Zone, said international orders had bounced back and a number of new factories have been announced.“These two factors have increased the number of workers in my industrial zone,” U Than Ye said.U Zaw Min Oo, the managing director of Crocodile garment factory, said manufacturers supplying the South Korean and Japanese markets had recently boosted output and overtime. But he added that orders from Europe and Latin America were stagnant.He said Myanmar was poised to benefit from recent labour unrest in China, uncertainty over the depth of the Chinese labour pool, increasing raw material costs, rising wages and strengthening workplace laws.However, Myanmar faces its own problems, he added.“Despite the increase in orders we’ve received, we cannot enjoy the wages that other workers in developing countries get,” U Zaw Min Oo said.He added that part of the reason behind the labour shortage is the loss of skilled garment workers to better paying positions at Mae Sot in Thailand and Malaysia.“We are running at maximum capacity right now with the current workforce we have,” U Zaw Min Oo said.“It is crucial that we recruit workers now if we’re going to meet our new orders” he added.U Than Ye said his company was struggling to keep up with the increase of orders from South Korea since May.“Our workforce of 600 is only enough for normal demand and we don’t really have enough for the orders we’ve just received. We’re recruiting another 100 employees to fill this demand,” U Than Ye said.But he said finding the workers has proven difficult because new factories have sprung up.U Than Aung Kyaw, director of the Directorate of Trade, said that a number of foreign companies have requested information about setting up factories here. But, the exact numbers are hard to come by. An MGMA official confirmed that interest in Myanmar as a garment manufacturer is heating up.“A number of garment companies have recently submitted applications to Myanma Investment Commission to operate garment factories here under the foreign direct investment law,” he said.One of the new factories is owned by Opal company and will be opened in the South Dagon Industrial Zone. Opal already operates a large garment factory in Hlaing Tharyar Industrial Zone that employs 4000 workers and the company is looking to recruit 1000 new workers for the South Dagon factory, an official from the South Dagon Industrial Zone management committee said last week.U Zaw Myo, a line supervisor at a garment factory in Shwe Pyi Thar Industrial Zone, said: “If we cannot get enough workers, it’s going to be difficult to meet export deadlines.”He added that SGI, which was set up through German foreign direct investment, is also recruiting hundreds of workers, using higher-than-normal wages to lure employees.Another issue slowing down hiring has been a government directive aimed at preventing terrorist attacks or sabotage at industrial zones.After Thingyan industrial zone management committees were told to closely scrutinise new recruitments.“Our recruitment policy in the garment industry is that new workers are appointed through the recommendation of current employees, whether they are friends or family,” U Myint Soe said.The total workforce employed by the garment industry is estimated at more than 85,000 in the 120 factories in Yangon’s industrial zones. Factories owned or operated by South Korean firms are believed to employ about 40 percent, or 37,000, of these.Garment exports remained almost unchanged from the 2008-09 to 2009-10 fiscal year approximately about US$280 million, according to MGMA statistics.","/business/5268-garment-factories-hindered-in-new-recruitment-drive.html"

And the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI) is doing its best to see it keeps going that way.Together with the Myanmar Industrial Association (MIA), the UMFCCI held a business matching session last week with the Association of Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia (ACCCIM) in Yangon to discuss how to further develop trade. The Malaysian party included about 30 members, all of whom had travelled to Myanmar to investigate opportunities on the local market. Most of the businessmen were seeking joint venture partnerships in manufacturing, trading and services in industrial products.A UMFCCI delegate said that in 2008-2009, trade between Myanmar and Malaysia leapt to a total of US$662.17 million, nearly three times higher than previous years, with exports from Myanmar of $311.69 million and imports of $350.48 million, according to the Central Statistical Organisation.“I think in 2008 Malaysian investors probably returned to Myanmar from other ASEAN countries,” said Dr Khin Aung Myint, a UMFCCI member.Malaysia invests in a total of 36 Myanmar enterprises, in oil and gas, manufacturing, real estate, hotels and livestock, participants at the meeting were told.Principal export items to Malaysia are products based on timber, agriculture and mining, and import items are steel, electrical goods, construction materials, chemicals and plastic products and machinery.“I’m here to look for human resources. I believe Myanmar has great potential in natural and human resources – Myanmar workers who come to Malaysia are not only good at their jobs, but also in languages,” said Mr Michael Heah, managing director of IRC Global Search, an international recruitment and outsourcing of manpower firm.He said that he was seeking skilled and unskilled manpower for manufacturing in electronics, garments, oil and gas, furniture and offer the human resources IT software for time attendance, process counter, training, education and HR and business consultancy.“We came to look at opportunities, we believe that Myanmar has great potential for investment, especially for ASEAN countries. I think this is also the right time because the financial crisis has nearly finished, and the economy of all the countries seem to be recovering,” said Mr Wong Choon Seng, the managing director of Saba Ready Mixed Concrete.“I was here 10 years ago and now I can see that there has been lots of activity and development, so we believe over the next three to five years, there should be a lot of economic opportunities available here,” he said.“Initially, we should look for what we can supply, and then we can get involved in the local Myanmar businesses, we have to look at what potential businesses here might be. The main attraction for us with Myanmar is that it has a loosely similar background and English is widely used. We believe that inflation is not too high either,” he said.“I’m just trying to look at all of the opportunities and try to understand the nature of business here.

"416",416,"Improved  electricity for Yangon industry ",2010-03-22,"National News","Htoo Trading and a Chinese partner will start work on a coal-fired power plant next July that will supply electricity to Yangon’s industrial zones, U Sein Oo, a director of the Htoo Group of Companies, told The Myanmar Times on March 17.          The US$300 million project will be implemented by the Ministry of Electric Power (1), Htoo Trading and Huaneng Lancang River Hydropower under the build, operate, transfer system, whereby the private companies will finance the construction and then operate the plant for a minimum of 20 years before transferring it back to the government.Htoo Trading will provide the majority of the investment, U Sein Oo said, while the Chinese company will supply the technology and most of the machinery. They will also be responsible for training local technicians to operate the plant.The plant, to be located on a 250-acre site in Htantabin township, Yangon Division, will initially provide 135 megawatts (MW) but that is expected to rise to 270MW after six months, he said.The project – Myanmar’s first coal-fired power plant – should be completed by the start of 2013.“The construction work will be complete within two and a half years. We will start providing electricity to industrial zones after two years as the first step,” said U Sein Oo.The plant will use coal from Kalewa mine in Sagaing Division and the electricity generated will supply factories in Yangon’s three industrial zones: Hlaing Tharyar, Shwe Pyi Thar and Shwe Lin Pan. Any surplus electricity generated will be diverted to meet domestic demand.To generate the maximum amount of power, the plant will require 3000 tonnes of coal a day, or more than 1 million tonnes a year.Myanmar produces about 250,000 tonnes of coal a year, according to government figures but there is potential for expansion.If Kalewa cannot provide enough, more will be imported from ASEAN countries, U Sein Oo said.“We will transport the coal along the Chindwin [River] and store at least six months’ supply near the plant,” said U Sein Oo. “The site of the plant has been selected bearing in mind the need to transport and unload coal.”He added that, as an environmental protection measure, the plant would be fitted with a smoke control system to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases.No price has yet been set for the power to be generated. The Ministry of Electric Power (2) charges domestic users K25 (about 2.5 US cents) per kilowatt hour and industry K50.Yangon’s electricity consumption is more than 300MW, but the actual demand is about double.U Myat Thin Aung, chairman of Hlaing Tharyar industrial zone, said there were about 1100 businesses in the three zones. While electricity consumption figures for Shwe Pyi Thar were not available, U Myat Thin Aung said total electricity consumption at Hlaing Tharyar and Shwe Lin Pan is 88MW but demand is actually much higher.U Sein Oo said he expected the three zones to consume at least 200MW when the plant comes online.","/national-news/5481-improved-electricity-for-yangon-industry.html"

Electrification, or the percentage of households connected to the electricity grid, is projected to rise to 80pc over the same period, while primary energy demand will increase by 2.6pc annually, slightly above projections for the region and almost double the global average.Mr Edito Barcelona, a consultant with the ADB who worked on the report, Energy Outlook for Asia and the Pacific, said the GDP growth projection was based on government policies and other information reported by Myanmar government officials during ASEAN meetings and workshops.“In modelling, we assumed that this GDP growth could come from energy exports such as oil, natural gas and hydroelectricity which would also spur growth in other sectors of the economy,” Mr Barcelona said.Dr Sean Turnell, a professor of economics at Australia’s Macquarie University and editor of Burma Economic Watch, said natural gas sales would not provide any new impetus to GDP growth until new projects came online in 2013.“It’s true that Myanmar’s energy sector will be the source of rising export surpluses into the future – and hence a net positive contributions to GDP growth – but there’s no reason to see this sector being a growing contributor to this end in the coming year,” Dr Turnell.“I think there will be growth in Myanmar and the report is right to note the stimulus of the pipeline construction and various other energy investments – but these are not large and have small multipliers into the broader economy, as Chinese construction often involves imported Chinese workers, for instance,” Dr Turnell said.Natural gas exports are expected to almost double over the next decade as the Shwe and Zawtika projects come online and Mr Barcelona said these profits, augmented with foreign investment, could then be used to fund the electrification.“To reach 80pc [electrification] in 2030, Myanmar needs to invest in increasing its electricity generating facilities, extension of its transmission and distribution lines as well as substation capacities to currently un-electrified areas in the country,” he said.","/national-news/5755-energy-exports-to-drive-8-6pc-gdp-growth-adb.html"

"419",419,"Teaching to a different tune",2009-09-07,"National News","Teaching at the Khayay International Preschool is anything but ordinary. Visit a class on three different days during any given week and you’ll see something unusual taking place: Classes are taught to children in four different languages.          It may sound like a marketing gimmick and the school’s founders and directors, Toru and Hitomi Iwasaki, freely admit children will not emerge from the preschool fluent in English, Myanmar, Japanese and Chinese.Luckily, that’s not the point. The aim is to best prepare children for learning languages in the future by exposing their growing minds – and ears – to as wide a range of sounds as possible.Humans hear sounds – or audible wave frequencies that are measured in Hertz (Hz) – ranging from about 100Hz to 15,000Hz, with every language having its own, unique band.At one of that scale is Russian, which has an extremely broad frequency – from 125Hz to 10,000Hz – while others, like Japanese, make do with a far narrower frequency band.The Iwasakis believe – and they are back by plenty of empirical and anecdotal evidence – that exposure to the broadest hertz band possible while children’s minds and ears are at their most receptive stage will leave children with a better foundation to learn languages later in life.“We understand that we are unable to fully teach all of those four languages to the children while they are here. We aim to familiarise them with those sounds so they will be more easily able to recognise them later,” says Mr Iwasaki.Anyone who has raised a child will be aware just how quickly they learn new things, languages included. Conversely, many people who have tried to learn a language later in life will know it can seem fiendishly tricky – particularly when trying to differentiate similar sounds.“Children’s brains are very flexible from the age of two onwards and are easily able to recognise more than just their mother language,” he says.“For many Myanmar children there will be very limited opportunities to learn those other three languages and the language they have picked up here will probably be lost unless they are pursued outside of their next school.“But we believe that if we teach them these sounds, at this early age, then they will remember them at a later stage.”It’s fitting that the school was conceived by Toru and Hitomi Iwasaki, since Japanese has a narrow hertz band and the teaching of foreign languages does not start in Japan until a child reaches 12 years of age – just as a normal child’s aural comprehension learning ability is tapering off, according to Thompson and Nelson’s The Developmental Course of Human Brain Development, a research paper published by the University of California, Los Angeles.Somewhat more anecdotal are Mrs Iwasaki’s early experiences trying to learn English, as well as those of the couple’s children.“I always wondered why some people are able to speak so many languages and if that was just some kind of talent they had,” Ms Iwasaki says.“When I was 11 I went on a school camp to Manila that was conducted exclusively in English and I struggled very hard initially. But within two weeks I could make out the words that people were using, even though nobody was actually teaching me,” she said.Mr Iwasaki’s position at the United Nations meant all three of their daughters were brought up in countries with different languages, which seems to have broadened their aural capacity.All three are able to speak at least three languages and were brought up in the United States, Africa or Myanmar, depending on where Mr Iwasaki’s UN posting took the family.While the school instructs in Japanese, English, Myanmar and Chinese, it still manages to maintain a preschool atmosphere. The subjects are exactly what you’d expect and include arts and crafts, singing, physical education and some gentle science.Discard or ignore the multiple language instruction and you’re left with a top-notch kindergarten in an attractive complex just off Parami Road, not far from the seven mile junction. The classrooms are inviting and comfortable, while the grounds are quiet and safe.Assigning colours to the preschool’s classrooms, which include soft blues, pinks, greens and oranges, was a labour of love for Mrs Iwasaki and builds on a lifelong fascination with colour. Each colour was chosen to create an emotional link for the children – blue for the youngest children and pink for the oldest class to show confidence and prepare them for the next stage in their education.All of the rooms are designed for comfort and practicality but with a number of subtle points to encourage learning, even while the children are effectively at play.A case in point is the library, which includes a growing collection of children’s books published in the four languages.The centre of the room is taken up by a small tunnel maze and, while unable to properly demonstrate the workings of the maze due to its diminutive proportions, Mr Iwasaki says it teaches children about “resilience competency”.“They crawl into the maze by themselves and it’s quite confined and dark inside,” he says, pointing to the escape holes cut in the top for children who become overwhelmed by the experience. “And they must navigate their way through to the other end by making the right decisions. But they must always consider on the maze itself because the spaces are small and it’s possible to hit your head if you’re not concentrating on your movement,” he says.The preschool also contains a science room, an art room and a music room. Ms Iwasaki says she was surprised how quickly the children learn new songs, irrespective of the language. Three repetitions is often enough for the children to remember the words and sing along, she says.“They remember with the songs that go with the music so quickly,” she adds.Other subtle learning aids are wall-mounted boxes with objects inside that are placed outside classrooms to assist children identify the particular room.As might be expected, finding teachers ready to teach in such a unique environment is no easy task, so the Iwasakis have set up a training centre to produce them. Sixteen teachers have so far completed the three-year training program since the centre was established in 2004.Of those 16 graduate teachers, seven are employed at the school to manage the 12 students currently enrolled at Khayay. But how are those teachers able to teach in so many languages?“Obviously it would be best if we were able to find teachers who spoke the four languages themselves but this is obviously fairly difficult,” Ms Iwasaki says.Instead, the teachers rely on “team teaching”. Each teacher specialises in a language other than Myanmar and then devises daily lesson plans in that language.The other teachers learn the basic words and numbers of the other languages but bring in the specialist teacher for specific lessons. There are also audio CDs to assist teachers and, accordingly, all classrooms have in-built sound systems.To avoid confusion for both children and teachers, only one language is used during a given day, although misunderstandings are generally clarified in a child’s strongest language, which is usually Myanmar.Tuition fees are handled by negotiation but are certainly significantly lower than other international-standard preschool centres in Yangon.“We’d like to make our fees cheaper than [what they are] but there is an investment here that we must continue to pay for and the training we provide [to teachers] at our centre is free,” Toru says.As for why the Iwasakis picked Myanmar – clearly a question that has been put to them before – Ms Iwasaki says, “It’s because we were already here.”","/national-news/6119-teaching-to-a-different-tune.html"

Smaller mines can be opened with less investment, then expanded when they start to show results, said U Aung Kyin, a geological consultant working for AK-Associate Company, which advises excavating companies in the local mining sector.The owner of a small mine can invite partners or shareholders to finance expansion if significant mineral deposits are found, U Aung Kyin told The Myanmar Times, adding that Myanmar mining law allowed small-scale mines to sell directly to buyers without having to build a huge plant to refine the metal.U Aung Kyin said some foreign countries had been investing in Myanmar’s mining sector since 1992. China had increased its investment by 70 percent since then, he said.“At present, Chinese businessmen have been investing in a lot of small-scale mines, both directly and indirectly,” said U Aung Kyin.However, Chinese investors tend to do business with their compatriots on the basis of oral agreements alone, without a written contract, he added.U Aung Kyin said that if a businessman from Yunan province invested in a small mine in Myanmar, he would contact another Chinese from Muse who would, in turn, deal with another Chinese, perhaps from Mandalay. As a result, he said, a host of different actors become involved.The Ministry of Mines gives two-year permits for mining excavation and defines the areas to be worked in terms of the metal being excavated, said an official from the ministry. He said that the permit could be extended for a further two years following a government survey.More than 60 companies are excavating lead and zinc in southern and northern Shan State, he said, and about 30 companies were mining tin and tungsten in Tanintharyi Division.","/business/6129-geo-consultant-urges-miners-to-start-small.html"
"421",421,"Garment demand from SK strong",2009-08-17,"Business","Korean firms are ordering more garments from Myanmar as tension along the border between North and South Korea has reportedly raised concerns about the security of the industrial zones there.          Though exports of hardwoods, fisheries and other products from Myanmar to Korea have fallen, garment orders from Korea are up significantly, say industry observers.“Orders from South Korea have increased by about 30pc compared with this time last year,” said U Zaw Min Oo, managing director of the Crocodile garment factory.Mainly because of the situation along the border between South and North Korea, sub-contracts for garment orders now come to Myanmar instead of to the border industrial zone, U Zaw Min Oo said.Korean embassy first secretary Mr Park Kil Chae told The Myanmar Times that relations between the two Koreas had become complicated, and the garment industry in Gaesung Industrial Zone in North Korea hesitated to expand its investment.“Under these circumstances, Korean buyers are expected to increase orders to Myanmar. But I am not sure when they will get into their stride in this country,” Mr Park said.U Zaw Min Win, who is also a secretary of Myanmar Garment Manufacturers’ Association (MGMA), said that factories producing work destined for the Korean market had to raise productivity and increase overtime.At the same time, orders from the European Union and Latin America continued to decline, though Japanese orders remained constant.U Myint Soe, president of MGMA estimated the total workforce employed in Myanmar’s garment industry at more than 85,000, in 120 factories in Yangon’s industrial zones.Of these, about 37,000 workers, or about 40pc of the total, were employed in garment factories operated by Korean investors.Garment exports to South Korea stood at US$30.4 million in 2008, slightly up from $30.2 million the previous year.“I think garment export orders to Korea are increasing because consumers tend to reduce their expenditure in the gloomy times and to buy cheaper,” said U Myint Soe.He said this was a very good opportunity for the Myanmar garment industry because it allowed Korean consumers to see the good quality and reasonable price of Myanmar products.Though the export volume of garments from Myanmar to South Korea increased by 16.2pc in the first half of this year, to $14.4 million, compared to the same period last year, South Korea is one of many countries affected by the worldwide recession, which has reduced consumer spending. However, World Bank senior vice president Justin Lin has predicted that economic recovery could come to Korea earlier than in many OECD countries.The recession may also have helped improve Myanmar’s trading position with China, Mr Park believes. As the average monthly wage of Chinese factory workers has risen to about $300-400 nowadays, orders for labour-intensive products such as garments are now going outside the country, he said.The same is true in Vietnam, where the average wage has risen to about $100. Myanmar workers earn from $40 to $70 depending on overtime.“Myanmar workers are mostly reliant on the overtime,” said Ko Zaw Than, a supervisor in one of the Korean garment factories in Hlaing Tha Yar Industrial Zone, adding that the factory could pay more overtime because of the increase in Korean orders. The average worker now earned about K50,000 ($50) a month, Ko Zaw Than said.","/business/6261-garment-demand-from-sk-strong.html"
